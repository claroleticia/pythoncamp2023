2023-08-18 00:00:00,"The President's News Conference with President Yoon Suk Yeol of the Republic of Korea and Prime Minister Kishida Fumio of Japan at Camp David, Maryland","
PRESIDENT BIDEN: Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Camp David.
If I seem like I'm happy, it's because I am. (Laughter.) This has been a great, great meeting.
Mr. President, Mr. Prime Minister, I -- we meet in this historic place to make a historic moment. And I believe that to be true. The -- this is a new era in partnership between Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the United States -- our new Camp David trilat. (Laughs.) That's what we have here.
And -- but before we dive into the progress we've made today -- if you excuse, we used to say in the Senate, ""a point of personal privilege"" -- I want to start by expressing my appreciation for the contribution that your countries have made toward the relief following the devastating wildfires in Hawaii. I want to thank you both on behalf of the American people.
I also want to note that my team is closely monitoring Hurricane Hilary, which is -- has the potential to bring significant rain and flooding to southern California. FEMA has pre-positioned personnel and supplies in the region, and they're ready to respond as needed. I urge everyone -- everyone in the path of this storm to take precautions and listen to the guidance from state and local officials.
And you've heard me say it before: The Republic of Korea and Japan are capable and indispensable allies.
Now, to the purpose of why we're here.
America's commitment to both countries is ironclad, and my personal commitment to bringing these three nations together was real from the very beginning.
Since last summer, we've met on the margins of the NATO Summit in Spain, the ASEAN Summit in Cambodia, and the G7 Summit in Japan. And today, we've made history with the first-ever standalone summit between the leaders of our three countries, as well as our commitment to meet together on the leader level annually and to have all of our relative Cabinet-member people meet on a regular basis for -- from this point on; not just this year, not next year -- forever. That's the i- -- that's the intention.
And so, I want to recognize the important work that both of you have done and the political courage -- and I mean this sincerely -- the political courage that you've both demonstrated to resolve difficult issues that would've stood in the way for a long time of a close relationship between Japan and Korea and with the United States.
Your leadership, with the full support of the United States, has brought us here, because each of you understands that our world stands at an inflection point -- a point where we're called to lead in new ways: to work together, to stand together. And today, I'm proud to say our nations are answering that call.
First, we're elevating our trilateral defense collaboration to deliver in the Indo-Pacific region. That includes launching annual multidomain military exercises, bringing our trilateral defense cooperation to an unprecedented levels.
We're doubling down on information sharing, including on the DPRK's missile launches and cyber activities, strengthening our ballistic missile defense cooperation.
And, critically -- critically, we've all committed to swiftly consult with each other in response to threats to any one of our countries from whatever source it occurs. That means we'll have a hotline to share information and coordinate our responses whenever there is a crisis in the region or affecting any one of our countries.
And today, we've reaffirmed -- all reaffirmed our shared commitment to maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and addressing ec- -- and addressing economic coercion.
We're going to continue to counter threats from the DPRK, including cryptocurrency money laundering to the tune of billions of dollars; potential arms transfer in support of Russia's brutal war against Ukraine.
And together -- together, we're going to stand up for international law, freedom of navigation, and the peaceful resolution of disputes in the South China Sea.
Second, we're expanding our economic cooperation to build an Ino -- an Indo-Pacific that is peaceful and prosperous.
Today, we've committed to launch a new -- what we call a ""Supply Chain Early Warning System"" -- excuse me, a Supply Chain Early Warning System Pilot and -- which will alert our nations to disruptions of certain products and materials, like critical minerals or batteries, so we can get ahead of the issues as we -- they appear with the experience -- that we've experienced in -- during the pandemic.
(Referring to a piece of audio equipment.) Excuse me, this is falling off. There you go.
And -- and building on the G7-led Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, we're deepening cooperation between our development finance institutions to mobilize more financing for quality infrastructure and secure communications technology to help low-income and middle-income countries throughout the region take on the challenges that matter most to their people.
And finally, our partnership is about building a better future for our people. That's why we're deepening our cooperation on global health and launching a trilateral expert exchange in support of the U.S. Cancer Moonshot initiative. That's going to, I believe, change cancer as we know it.
It matters a great deal to me and to families all across our three countries. In the United States, we are revolutionizing the way we do cancer research. And together, the three of us, I am confident we can harness our shared spirit of innovation and end cancer as we know it.
We're also launching a new collaboration between our National Laboratories and advance our science knowledge and technological capabilities together. As we do, we'll work in lockstep to set the standards for safe, secure, and trustworthy emerging technology, including artificial intelligence, which a lot of work has to be done on.
Let me close with this. Mr. President, Mr. Prime Minister, this is the first summit I've hosted at Camp David as President. I can think of no more fitting location to begin the next era -- our next era of cooperation -- a place that has long symbolized the power of new beginnings and new possibilities.
In the months and years ahead, we're going to continue to seize those possibilities together -- unwavering in our unity and unmatched in our resolve. This is not about a day, a week, or month. This is about decades and decades of relationships that we're building.
Mr. Prime Minister and Mr. President, I want to thank you for your leader, and I -- leadership -- and I say it again -- for your courage that brought us together. And I look forward to working with you both of you ahead.
Now I yield to -- who am I yielding to?
MODERATOR: Distinguished guests --
PRESIDENT BIDEN: There you go.
MODERATOR: -- the President of the Republic of Korea.
PRESIDENT BIDEN: We needed the voice of God to tell us that. (Laughter.)
PRESIDENT YOON: (As interpreted.) First of all, I'd like to thank President Biden for his warm hospitality. It is a great pleasure to visit Camp David along with Prime Minister Kishida. Camp David is a site that bears historical significance where important diplomatic decisions were made at critical junctures of modern history.
In order to respond to today's unprecedented polycrisis, the ties between our three countries, which are the most advanced liberal democracies in the region and major economies leading advanced technology and scientific innovation, are more important than ever.
From this moment on, Camp David will be remembered as a historic place where the Republic of Korea, the United States, and Japan proclaimed that we will bolster the rules-based international order and play key roles to enhance regional security and prosperity based on our shared values of freedom, human rights, and rule of law.
Today, we, the three leaders, held the very first standalone trilateral summit marking a new chapter in our trilateral cooperation. Today, we have agreed on the Camp David principles that will function as the enduring guidelines for our trilateral cooperation. In addition, we have developed the Spirit of Camp David, which is a document embodying the vision of our trilateral cooperation and ways to translate our will to cooperate into action.
First of all, to facilitate the stable development of our trilateral cooperation, we have built the institutional basis for the trilateral cooperation at multiple levels and sectors. In addition to making our trilateral summit regular, we have agreed to have our governments' personnel at all levels -- including foreign ministers, defense ministers, and national security advisors -- meet every year to closely coordinate our trilateral cooperation.
In particular, we, the three leaders, have agreed to establish a communication channel so we can swiftly coordinate and respond together in case an urgent issue occurs in the region.
Furthermore, to bolster our trilateral strategic cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, our three countries will establish the ROK, U.S., Japan Indo-Pacific dialogue, which will discover new areas of cooperation. Also, along with the economic security dialogue led by our three countries' NSCs, we have agreed to found a consultative body for development policy coordination and also build cooperation frameworks in various sectors including global health and women empowerment.
We have also decided to hold our ROK, U.S., and Japan Global Leadership Youth Summit to strengthen ties between our future generations.
Second, we have agreed to step up our security cooperation to ensure our people's safety and peace in the region based on the now institutionalized Cooperation Framework.
First of all, to this end, we have consulted on practical ways to cooperate, aimed at improving our joint response capabilities to North Korea's nuclear and missile threats, which have become sophisticated more than ever. The real-time sharing of DPRK missile warning data, which was agreed upon during the Phnom Penh summit last November, will be activated within this year. And this will make a significant progress in strengthening our three nations' capabilities to detect and track North Korea's missiles.
In countering the DPRK's nuclear and missile threats, we concurred the trilateral defense exercises were crucial. As such, annual plans will be established for the ROK, U.S., Japan drills we committed to.
In the meantime, as North Korea funds its nuclear and missile programs by exploiting labor and human rights, efforts to monitor and stem such activities will be redoubled. To deter the DPRK's illicit funding activities, a new trilateral working group on DPRK cyber activities will be established.
Moreover, Korea, the U.S., and Japan, in their pursuit of Indo-Pacific strategies, oppose any unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force.
Respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity, the peaceful settlement of disputes, among others, undergird a rules-based international order that we resolve to safeguard by intensifying our collaboration.
As part of such endeavors, our three nations agreed to support ASEAN and Pacific Island countries with their maritime security capacity-building efforts.
Furthermore, to help Ukrainians regain freedom and pursue reconstruction, we are determined to increase our three-way coordination.
Next, we, the three leaders, discussed how to work together to promote shared prosperity and future growth. First of all, in the field of economic security directly linked to our national economies of the three countries, we will work to expand our strategic partnership.
To ensure global supply chain resilience and energy security, we pledged to bolster our trilateral cooperation. To manage global supply chain risks, an early warning system will be established together.
In addition, we decided to broaden our collaboration in the field of cutting-edge technologies to secure future growth engines. Specifically, in AI, quantum, bio, and next-generation telecommunications and space sectors, cooperation among our three countries will deliver powerful synergies.
Korea, the U.S., and Japan committed to have their national laboratories expand joint R&D and personnel exchanges, providing a cornerstone for the three countries' leadership in science and technology innovation.
Moreover, for the sake of shared prosperity in the Asia Pacific, in line with the needs of ASEAN and Pacific Island countries, effective support measures will be sought and implemented collectively.
Today, we, the three leaders, affirmed our commitment to the trilateral partnership towards a new era and possibilities thereof.
Grounded in the core values of freedom, human rights, and the rule of law, a strong alliance of values among Korea, the U.S., and Japan will help build a world that's more peaceful and prosperous by serving as a sturdy foundation.
Mr. President, I thank you once again for your hospitality. Next time, I hope that we will be reunited in the Republic of Korea.
Thank you. (Applause.)
MODERATOR: Distinguished guests, the Prime Minister of Japan.
PRESIDENT BIDEN: President.
PRIME MINISTER KISHIDA: (As interpreted.) Thank you. First of all, in Maui, Hawaii, wildfires caused devastating damage. I express my sympathy, and I really pray for the peace of those who have lost their lives.
In order to offer support, a total of $2 million worth of support by our country has been decided. And the full -- the relief for the affected people and for the earliest recovery of the affected areas, Japan will proactively do our contribution.
Today, I have visited Camp David, and the three of us have spent a truly meaningful time. I expressed my heartfelt gratitude to Joe for the kind invitation.
Together with Joe and President Yoon, this has been a precious opportunity for myself to further deepen the relationship of trust and confidence. For the first time ever, instead of in the sidelines of multilateral conferences, we have held the trilateral summit on a standalone basis.
Here at Camp David, numerous historical meetings have taken place. And it is a huge honor to have printed a fresh page in its history with this meeting.
The foundation of the trilateral collaboration are the solid, firm, bilateral relationships. The three of us have understood this more than anyone else and have executed our understanding in practice.
In January of this year, I visited the United States, and later, President Yoon visited Japan in March and then to the U.S. in April. And in May, I myself traveled to South Korea, and we have bolstered our mutual relationship.
At the moment, the free and open international order, based on the rule of law, is in crisis. Due to Russia's aggression of Ukraine, the international order is shaken from its foundation. The unilateral attempt to change the status quo by force in the East and South China Seas are continuing. And the nuclear and missile threat of North Korea is only becoming ever larger.
Under such circumstances, to make our trilateral strategic collaboration blossom and bloom is only logical and almost inevitable and is required in this era.
The three of us here today declare our determination to pioneer the new era of Japan, U.S., ROK partnership.
How we will advance the cooperation of our three countries going forward, I will discuss from three perspectives.
Firstly, the coordination between the Japan-U.S. and the U.S.-ROK alliances will be reinforced, and trilateral security cooperation will be brought to a new height.
At this meeting, we agreed to hold the Japan-U.S.-ROK multidomain joint exercises on an annual basis. Furthermore, regarding the real-time sharing of North Korea's missile warning information that we agreed last November, the initial steps have been implemented and an important first step has been advanced towards the launch of the mechanism by the end of the year.
We also agreed on the establishment of the working group on North Korea cyber activities, considered to be the source of finance for nuclear and missile development and on other matters.
The second point is the promotion of cooperation between the United States, Japan, and South Korea and the expansion of their areas of cooperation regarding the response to North Korea.
In addition to strengthening regional deterrence and response capabilities, the three countries agreed to strengthen cooperation for the full implementation of sanctions and to work closely together in the U.N. Security Council, where all three countries will be members in 2024.
At the same time, we shared our recognition that the way is open for dialogue with North Korea. I then stated that the abduction issue is a humanitarian issue with time constraints and once again received the strong support of Joe and President Yoon for the immediate resolution of this matter.
We also agreed to work together through the Indo-Pacific dialogue and the development cooperation to realize a free and open Indo-Pacific and, in particular, to coordinate capacity-building support in the domain of maritime security, particularly with regard to ASEAN and Pacific Island countries.
Furthermore, we agreed to promote cooperation in the field of economic security, including critical and emerging technologies and supply chain resilience.
Third, developing a framework for trilateral cooperation. This will create a foundation for continuous and stable enhancement of coordination among the three countries.
After confirming that the three countries will promote multi-layered cooperation at all levels, it was agreed that the trilateral summit meeting will be held at least once a year.
And likewise, the ministers of foreign affairs, defense, and national security advisors will each also meet at least once a year. And the financial minister, as well as the industry and commerce ministers, will be meeting.
We will consider the Camp David principles issued today at a historic turning point for the international community to be a new compass for trilateral cooperation, and we will vigorously implement the concrete cooperation outlined in the Camp David statement of Japan, ROK, and U.S. on our partnership.
Together with Joe and President Yoon, we will continue to work to further strengthen the strategic partnership between the three countries in order to safeguard a free and open international order based on the rule of law.
Thank you. (Applause.)
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Thank you. Now we have time for questions. President Biden, please select your reporter first.
PRESIDENT BIDEN: Aamer, with the AP.
Q: Thank you, Mr. President. I have a question for each of the leaders. They will be brief and -- but related.
President Biden, first for you: How confident should Asia be about a robust American commitment to a nuclear umbrella when the Compa- -- Commander-in-Chief who preceded you and is looking to succeed you spoke openly about reducing the U.S. footprint in the Korean Peninsula?
President Yoon, how much confidence can Japan and the U.S. have about Seoul's long-term commitment to rapprochement when polls show the solid majority of Korea disapproves of your handling and mending of the forced labor issue?
And, Prime Minister Kishida, what assurances can you give to your country's citizens who fear bolstering your security cooperation in this matter could lead to -- the country into an economic cold war with China?
And if you'll indulge me, Mr. President, on a domestic matter: What is your reaction to the Special Counsel appointment last week into your son?
Thank you.
PRESIDENT BIDEN: (Laughs.) Well, first of all, look, there's not much, if anything, I agree on with my predecessor on foreign policy. His America First policy, walking away from the rest of the world, has made us weaker, not stronger.
America is strong with our allies and our alliances, and that's why we will endure. And it's a strength that -- quite frankly, that increases all the -- three of our strengths.
This is just about one summit. What makes today different is it actually launches a series of initiatives that are actually institutional changes in how we deal with one another -- in security cooperation, economic cooperation, technology cooperation, development cooperation, consultation exercises. And all of this will create (inaudible) momentum, I believe, year by year, month by month, to make the relationship stronger and more certain to remain to be in place.
And with regard -- on these esult- -- results, I think you're going to keep it going. And I think you're going to benefit all our countries.
And with regard to the second question, I make -- I have no comment on any investigation that's going on. That's up to the Justice Department, and that's all I have to say.
PRESIDENT YOON: (As interpreted.) To the question that was directed to me, I would like to say that the treaty made between Korea and Japan that was made in 1965 and the following measures by the government and the Supreme Court's ruling in 2015 have some differences. But we have already implemented measures to bridge the gaps among them.
And in South Korea, of course, there is public opinion that is opposed to the government's measures like that. However, from a perspective that's forward-looking, strengthening ties and improving relationships between Korea and Japan are important and there is a shared understanding that this matters to our bilateral relationship, as well as our future. And this is something we need to continue working on.
PRIME MINISTER KISHIDA: (As interpreted.) Thank you for the question. First of all, at today's meeting, the rules-based international order and activities inconsistent to such rule-based international order and activities. Other concerns have been shared, and the rule-based, free and open international order must be defended. And going forward, the U.S., Japan, ROK strategic collaboration will be reinforced even further. Such endeavors will continue going forward.
Our country and for the surrounding countries, the response capabilities, as well as defense capabilities, will be bolstered. And by doing so, the lives and livelihood of our population will be protected and the sense of assurance must be raised. These are the important activities.
Having said that, with regard to China, last year, in November, there was the Japan-China Leaders Summit, and there was a positive momentum. By maintaining the positive momentum, what has to be asserted will be asserted. And we shall strongly request responsible conduct. And we will continue an accumulative conversation about multiple issues. We will cooperate with regard to common challenges. Such constructive and stable relationship will be established by mutual effort.
That is my administration's consistent policy. Based on this perception towards regional stability, our efforts will continue.
Thank you.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: President Yoon, next question, please.
PRESIDENT YOON: (As interpreted.) Please go ahead and ask a question. The reporter from Money Today -- reporter named Jongjin Park. Please go ahead with your question.
Q: (As interpreted.) Hi, I'm Jongjin Park of Money Today. First of all, I would like to ask a question to President Yoon Suk Yeol of the Republic of Korea. I heard that you said that a new chapter has opened in our trilateral cooperation with the two countries. Compared to the previous summits, what would be the most significant outcome that you gained through this summit?
And also, from the perspective of our people, what would be the benefit that the people of Korea would feel from these strengthening of ties?
And now my question goes to President Biden. During this summit, the issues of detainees or prisoners of wars -- and you mentioned that there will be further cooperation in these human rights issues. And you also said you will support the free and peaceful Korean Peninsula in the region. And what kind of shift would there be in your policy? And what kind of specific solutions do you have in this regard?
Lastly, I would like to direct my question to Prime Minister Kishida. Today, we had a historic trilateral summit. However, there was much backlash and many concerns in Korea. However, President Yoon showed his political courage to do so. That's the international community's evaluation.
However, there are still concerns that Japan is making very passive efforts to resolve our issues that still remain. And also, how would you be able to show your truthful willingness to resolve and improve our bilateral relations going forward?
PRESIDENT YOON: (As interpreted.) First of all, this trilateral cooperation amongst our three countries has opened a new chapter, and we made that announcement today to talk about the differences from the past cooperation.
For instance, in the past, it was about individual issues that we sought cooperation among ourselves. But now, as we have opened a new chapter in our cooperation for security, economy, science and technology, and development cooperation for the Global South, health, and women -- across all of these issues, our three countries decided to closely work together. So it's much more comprehensive in nature.
Such comprehensive cooperation has been launched by us today because currently we face complicated crisis and the threat from the DPRK. And across the world, we believe that we can together make a contribution to freedom and peace around the world.
So that is our foundational understanding and our common and shared interests of the three countries. And not just for exclusionary interests of ourselves. Our interests are well aligned with the universal interests of the members of the global community. That's where we find our shared interests lie.
And at the same time, this framework of comprehensive cooperation among our three countries will contribute to global supply chain resilience, global financial market stability, cooperation in the frontier technology sectors and science.
Our three countries together have the best-in-class expertise in science and technology. And we are the ones who are implementing liberal democracies.
Naturally, progress in science and technologies will bring benefits -- tangible benefits to our people, not just in terms of security, but also in terms of economy and science and technology.
But what is most important here is not about our own interests only. When we put our forces together, I believe that we can make a contribution to the advancement of freedom and peace in the world. And that's exactly where our interests are aligned.
PRESIDENT BIDEN: I -- look, back in May of 2022, I met with the families of the Japanese abductees during my visit, heard their stories, and empathized with them and got a sense of the pain they're feeling. It's real.
We know there are many families out there who still wait and worry and wonder. We're not going to forget about them or their loved ones.
And there's clear language on this on our joint statement. The bottom line is this: that we share a common position. We're committed to working together to see the return of all prisoners of war and -- and those who've been abducted and detained.
And by the way, one of the things we get asked many times -- and it wasn't directly asked, but implied -- is what makes us think any of this is positive.
Success brings success. When other nations see cooperation in the region, they make judgments about: Would they be better off if they made commitments? Will they move?
Think about -- as students of history, all of you -- and you are -- think about how many times successes have generated other successes when you don't anticipate it.
And so, I -- I just think this is a -- we're not going to forget, we're not giving up, and we're going to continue to make the case for the freedom of all of those detainees.
PRIME MINISTER KISHIDA: (As interpreted.) With regard to your question for me, first of all, I have strong feelings about strengthening bilateral relationships between the ROK and Japan. I share that with President Yoon. The two countries, in dealing with international challenges, should cooperate. We're both important neighboring countries. And so, friendship with President Yoon and a relationship of trust, based on this, both countries as partners should open up a new era. And that is my thinking.
This year, President Yoon came to Japan, and I visited the ROK. At international fora, we have repeated meetings -- we have had repeated meetings. And between our two countries, including the economy and security, we've had forward-looking and concrete approaches which were started. It's already in motion, dynamically.
Economic security dialogue was started -- or it has been decided on. In the area of export control, there have been progress. And also financial ministers and defense ministers have had meetings.
And so, we've had this very positive, forward-looking developments. And these are seen not only in the public sector. Also in the private sector, we see a slate of developments, human exchanges, and exchanges between business circles. We're seeing very active developments in all of these areas, and that is a reality.
Going forward, we hope to accumulate these approaches along with President Yoon to strengthen our bilateral relations even further. By generating results, we hope that people will understand Japan's feelings towards our bilateral relations. And we'd like to continue such efforts.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Then, let me see. From Kyodo -- Tajiri-san, Kyodo News.
Q: (As interpreted.) Tajiri, Kyodo News. At Camp David with history. I do have a question to each of the leaders.
President Biden, it was mentioned at this summit meeting that Russia's aggression of Ukraine is continuing. So, what role do you expect of Japan?
Prime Minister Kishida has mentioned that as China's threat in Asia is rising, Ukraine may be East Asia tomorrow. What do you think about this comment, President Biden?
And the situation in Asia, where China's threat is rising -- what is the meaning and significance of the trilateral relationship with Japan, U.S., ROK becoming stronger in multiple layers?
President Yoon Suk Yeol, I have a question to Your Excellency. North Korea's nuclear missile development is a major security threat to Japan, South Korea, and the U.S. As North Korea's provocations continue to escalate, what is the meaning and significance of the three countries declaring a new era of partnership?
Regarding the release of treated water at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, did Prime Minister Kishida explain the matter at the trilateral or the bilateral summit today?
To the recent Japan-ROK summit meeting, Your Excellency, you expressed your intent to respect the IAEA report despite the strong domestic opposition. Why do you demonstrate your understanding for the policy of Kishida administration? I ask for that reason.
And to Prime Minister Kishida, this is the first time that a trilateral summit is held on a standalone basis rather than on the sidelines of international meetings. You have said that the trilateral cooperation will be raised to new heights for the security environment in East Asia. And without the resolution of abduction, North Korea is continuing nuclear missile development. What is the meaning for North Korea?
And in eastern South China Seas, by maritime advancement, China is continuing unilateral attempts to change the status quo. What is the meaning for China?
PRESIDENT BIDEN: And you have a great imagination. One question ends up being six. But, thank you. I'll try to answer all of it. (Laughter.) I'm glad I didn't have you as my law professor when he said ""one question."" (Laughs.) At any rate, they're all legitimate questions.
Look, on Ukraine, I and my country and the leadership of my country in both parties are very grateful for everything Japan is helping to deal with in Ukraine. And I mean that sincerely. You've showed strong leadership through the G7 as well and contributed to a significant amount of financial and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, as well as nonlethal military equipment.
And, you know -- and they joined so many other nations in holding Russia accountable through their international sanctions.
If my memory serves me well -- and I think it does, Mr. Prime Minister -- we found ourselves in a circumstance where, when I called you about Ukraine, I didn't have to convince you of anything. I started off to make the case that Ukraine was a circumstance where -- to think, in the first quarter of the 20th century, another country would amass over 150,000 forces on the border of another country -- or 150,000 forces and invade that country -- invade that country without any rationale other than -- if you read Putin's speech after he invaded, he talked about Kyiv being the motherland. You know, I mean, it just was ridiculous, I think. And he talked about being Peter the Great. It was --
Just imagine if we had done nothing. Imagine if we had done nothing.
And the point was immediately recognized, if I'm not mistaken, by you, Mr. Prime Minister, that we're
in a situation where it could happen anywhere. If we stand -- if we had stood still, what signal would that send to China about Taiwan? What signal would that send around the world if nations weren't powerful on borders?
But here's the deal. You contributed significantly to what, I think, is already the --
Let me put it this way. Russia has already lost. It cannot meet its original objective which it stated. It's not possible.
But -- and they've joined so many other nations in holding Russia accountable for international sanctions. But Japan's leadership, from day one, it has been critical for making it clear that the consequences for war extend well beyond Europe -- well beyond Europe.
I say it in reverse. What would happen if an Asian country with 150,000 troops invaded another? You think that would not affect the interests, the economy, and -- and the foreign policy of nations in Europe and Latin America all across the world? It would have profound impact.
And with Japan's leadership, from day one, it has been critical to making clear the consequences of this will extend well beyond Europe -- well beyond Europe. It's a global issue that has impacts everywhere. And the Prime Minister's comments at Shangri La capture that.
And by the way, you know, we talked about this being an inflection point. The world is changing. The world is changing. And about every six or seven generations, it makes significant change. And there's a lot happening.
And the idea that we're going to sit down, the rest of the world, and say, ""Well, that's only a European problem."" There hasn't been that kind of invasion since World War Two.
And so -- as for peace, we all want that, of course. Ukrainians want it most of all. And my team has been working very closely with the -- President Zelenskyy's team and further peace formula, noting that ""nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.""
But nonetheless, we're meeting with them constantly -- constantly.
And your other two questions about China -- I'll just say this: This summit was not about China. That was not the purpose of the meeting. But it did come -- China obviously came up. Not to say we don't share concerns about the economic coercion or heightened tensions caused by China, but this summit was really about our relationship with each other and deepening cooperation across an entire range of issues that went well beyond just the immediate issues we raised.
It was about more peaceful and prosperous Indo-Pacific -- a region, quite frankly, that would benefit everyone living there and around the world if we get it right. It's not just here. It has a phenomenal impact.
Think about what's -- at any rate, I won't get going. I'll take too long.
But as you've seen from the initiatives we're announcing here, today is just how committed we are to see this vision take place. And I think this relationship that we put together and I think we're going to -- you're going to see it expand. It's not merely what we did today. This is a historic meeting.
But we're about to -- we've laid in place a long-term structure for a relationship that will last and have a phenomenal impact not just in Asia, but around the world.
Someone once said in a different context that -- about a health- -- a healthcare provision in my country a while ago: This is a big deal. This is a big deal.
Thank you.
Q: President Biden, how soon do you anticipate meeting with President Xi --
PRESIDENT BIDEN: They have to answer their questions.
PRESIDENT YOON: (As interpreted.) Yes, let me address the questions directed to me.
First, as to North Korea's nuclear and missile provocations and the threats that are posed and how we plan to counter those threats together among our three countries, let me address that question.
Of the cooperative frameworks among our three countries is the most -- what is most symbolic out of those is our cooperation in defense area. Any provocations or attacks against any one of our three countries will trigger a decision-making process of this trilateral framework, and our solidarity will become even stronger and harder.
And at the same time, missile information will be shared in a real-time basis, and systematic training and drills will be implemented in accordance with systematic annual schedules, regular schedules, and regular trainings that we plan to carry out together against the DPRK's missile provocations. That will be our response.
And at the same time, regarding your question concerning the water release from the Fukushima plant, as a matter of fact, that issue was not addressed during our summit because it was not on the agenda.
But still, let me try to address that question. The Fukushima plant's treated water, if it's going to have some type of impact, it would flow through the entire Pacific Ocean having an impact not just on our three countries, but all countries around the world.
As such, for the sake of safety and health of the people of our three countries and all members of the international community, that should be something that we need to place the highest priority on.
Regarding this treated water, based on scientific principles, all of the processing should be carried out accordingly. And at the same time, internationally recognized and reliable IAEA's investigation results are something that we can trust.
And I would like to make sure that everything is conducted and carried out in accordance with the procedures established by the IAEA. Together with the international community and also together with the Koreans, transparent data disclosure would be necessary, in my opinion.
PRIME MINISTER KISHIDA: (As interpreted.) Thank you. The question to myself. As you mentioned, nuclear and missile development by North Korea or unilateral attempts to change the status quo in the East and South China Seas are ongoing. And the security environment surrounding our three countries, it has becoming increasingly harsh day after day.
Under this backdrop, on this occasion, we agreed to enhance the coordination between the U.S.-Japan and the U.S.-ROK alliances and to bring the trilateral security cooperation to new heights.
This is indeed the requirement of this era. And by this summit, I am sure that the trilateral security cooperation will further advance and reinforce the regional peace and stability.
In particular, with regard to North Korea, we were able to put forward concrete results, such as the implementation of annual Japan, U.S, ROK multidomain and joint exercises and the establishment of a working group to address North Korea's cyber activities.
I also stated that the abduction issue is a humanitarian issue with time constraints. And Joe and President Yoon reiterated their strong support for the immediate resolution of this matter.
We also shared our recognition that the path to dialogue with North Korea is open.
Furthermore, once again, the presidents of both countries aligned with me in strongly opposing unilateral changes to the status quo through the use of force.
We will continue our efforts to further strengthen the strategic partnership among the three countries in order to defend the free, open, and international order based on the rule of law.
That is all. Thank you.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: This concludes --
PRESIDENT BIDEN: To answer your question, I expect and hope to follow up on our conversation on Bali this fall. That's my expectation. Thank you.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: This concludes our press conference. Please -- please stay seated as the -- the leaders depart, please. Please stay seated.
Q: Mr. President, are you winning the competition with China?
PRESIDENT BIDEN: We're winning all the competition.

2023-08-18 00:00:00,"Remarks Prior to a Meeting with President Yoon Suk Yeol of the Republic of Korea and Prime Minister Kishida Fumio of Japan at Camp David, Maryland","
PRESIDENT BIDEN: Well, welcome, everyone. Mr. Prime Minister, Mr. President, it's an honor to welcome you both here today to inaugurate the Camp David trilateral between our three nations -- among our three nations.
It's not only the first summit I've hosted at Camp David, it's the first-ever standalone summit between the leaders of Japan and Republic of Korea and the United States.
And I can think of no better way -- no better way to mark our new chapter of our trilateral cooperation than meeting here at Camp David.
And so, strengthening the ties between our democracies has long been a priority for me, dating back to when I was vice president of the United States. That's because our countries are stronger and the world is safer -- let me say that again --our countries are stronger and the world will be safer as we stand together. And I know this is a belief we all three share.
And I want to thank you both for your political courage that brought you here. And I'm looking forward to us having a great meeting, but continuing these meetings.
You've stepped up to do the hard work -- the, I would argue, historic work -- to forge a foundation from which we can face the future together -- the three of us together.
And I'm deeply grateful for your leadership, and I look forward to working with both of you as we begin this new era of cooperation and renew our resolve to serve as a force of good across the Indo-Pacific and, quite frankly, around the world as well.
President Yoon, let me turn this over to you.
PRESIDENT YOON: (As interpreted.) I would like to extend my gratitude to President Biden for his warm hospitality. Last July, we met in Vilnius for the NATO Summit, and I'm pleased to be reunited in about a month.
At this symbolic venue of Camp David in the history of modern diplomacy, our trilateral partnership is opening a new chapter, which carries great significance, in my view.
President Roosevelt once stated: Freedom is not a given but something you fight to win. To make sure that each of our freedoms is neither threatened or damaged, our three nations must tighten our solidarity. Such is also our promise and mandate towards our future generations.
The stronger coordination between Korea, the U.S., and Japan requires more robust institutional foundations. Moreover, challenges that threaten regional security must be addressed by us building a stronger commitment to working together.
Today will be remembered as a historic day where we established a firm institutional basis and commitments to the trilateral partnership.
Today, I hope we will explore together ways to elevate cooperation between Korea, the U.S., and Japan to a new plane through in-depth discussions.
PRIME MINISTER KISHIDA: (As interpreted.) First of all, I would like to express my sympathy once again for the devastating damages caused by the wildfires in Maui, Hawaii. In order to provide relief to the affected people, Japan has decided to offer a total of around $2 million of support. I offer my heartfelt prayer for the earliest possible recovery of the affected areas.
May I also once again convey my heartfelt condolences for the passing away of President Yoon's father.
And now I would like to thank Joe for your kind invitation to the two of us to Camp David, a place with history.
President Yoon, I have been meeting you almost on a monthly basis since March of this year. But the fact that we -- the three leaders have got together in this way, I believe, means that we are indeed making a new history as of today.
The international community is at a turning point in history. In order to allow the potential of our trilateral strategic collaboration to bloom and to blossom, I wish to take this moment to raise the security -- the coordination between Japan, ROK, and the U.S. to new heights while strengthening the coordination between the Japan-U.S. and the U.S.-ROK alliances as we deepen our cooperation in the response to North Korea.
I wish to expand and deepen our collaboration in extensive areas, including economic security, such as critical and emergent technology, cooperation, and supply chains resilience.
Today, I look forward to engaging in frank discussions amongst ourselves in order to declare a new area of Japan, U.S., ROK partnership.
I once again express my gratitude for Joe's initiative. Thank you.
PRESIDENT BIDEN: Thank you. We politely ask the press to -- to leave. Thank you for coming in.

2023-08-17 00:00:00,"Remarks in an Exchange with Reporters in Avoca, Pennsylvania","
THE PRESIDENT: I'm just going to make a brief comment about my friend, Ellen Casey. You know, she -- I don't know if -- some of you Scrantonians may have known her. But she loved with a fierceness and a tenderness that was incredible. And it was the Irish of her. She just was incredible.
And I was saying earlier that -- my sister and I were talking about her. And my sister reminded me of a quote about Michelangelo. It said: He saw the angel in the marble and carved until he set it free. That's what she did with everybody. I mean, she really did, if you're knew her.
I know this sounds like an exaggeration, but I've been coming back home since -- I've never left, actually. And I've known the Caseys for the bulk of my life. I don't remember when I didn't know the Ca- -- the Caseys.
And Bobby's dad was older than me, then I am older than Bobby. And we lived not far from one another. He was on Wyoming Avenue, and I lived on North Washington Avenue. We went to the same parish, St. Paul's.
And anyway, just a -- she's an incredible woman. And she raised an enormously successful and decent family. All the values I learned, I learned them here in Scranton. And she was an embodiment of them.
So, I -- the reason I am not going to the funeral tomorrow is everyone would have to be wanded to go in -- that I'd -- I'd mess everything up if I went.
But in addition to that, I have to meet with -- at Camp David with two world leaders tomorrow morning.
But in addition, I didn't come -- I'm not going to stay at the viewing when the people are coming in. But, again, they have to be wanded; I just become an impediment.
I just want to show my respect to the family. So --
Q: Can you tell us about your Hawaii trip, sir?
THE PRESIDENT: No, not now. I'm going to be leaving, and I'll be there on Monday.
Q: Why is it important that you go?
Q: Sir, do you think --
THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.

THE PRESIDENT: I'll speak about one thing: Mrs. Casey. Nothing else.
Q: Okay.
THE PRESIDENT: Do you have a question about Casey?
Q: Yes. What was her role in -- in your life?
THE PRESIDENT: She played an enormous role, not just in my life but everyone's.
You know, there's a quote my sister always uses about Michelangelo. It says: He saw the angel in the marble, and he carved and he set it free. That's who she was. She was an incredible woman -- decent, honorable. Her values were amazing.
And every time I would go to Scranton over the years, I would stop and see her. She was a friend.
Anyway, I'm going up or I'm going to be late for Bobby.
Q: Will you come talk to us about Hawaii?
Q: On the Camp David summit, are you willing to share what your goals are for the summit, sir?

2023-08-16 00:00:00,Remarks on the Anniversary of the Inflation Reduction Act,"
THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Scott. (Applause.) Thank you, thank you, thank you. (Applause.) Please, thank you.
I think your patience today exceeds your good judgment, but thank you. (Laughter.)
And I want to say one thing to your children: I know some really great ice cream places around here -- (laughter) -- and Daddy owes you. Okay? (Laughter.) So, talk to me afterwards.
Folks, thanks for the introduction. And, Scott, thank you very much.
You know, I want to thank Vice President Harris; members of the Cabinet -- Secretary Vilsack, Administrator Regan; you know, members of Congress, and particularly Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, who played such a pivotal role in getting this bill done.
Everyone was telling us there is no possibility with the divided Congress -- the way it was -- that we could get it done. And you got it done without a single vote on the other team, although that began to change at the end.
And all the special guests, state and local leaders, business leaders, entrepreneurs, advocates.
You know, one year ago, with your leadership, I signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law and -- one of the most significant laws I think has ever been enacted -- taking on the special interests and winning -- and winning. (Applause.)
Delivering -- delivering on promises that have long been made to the American people to lower costs for families, especially healthcare costs, increase America's energy security, restore fairness to a tax code, create good-paying jobs here in America, and to address the existential threat of climate crisis.
You know, it's part of a much broader vision for our country: growing the economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down.
I'm a capitalist. I think if you can go make a billion dollars, go make it. I'm all for that. Just pay your taxes. (Laughter.)
But because when the middle class does well -- all kidding aside -- everybody does well. Everybody. The poor have a ladder up. The middle class are -- have a good shot. And -- and -- and the wealthy do very well.
The Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal initially called my plan ""Bidenomics."" I'm not sure they meant it in a totally complimentary way at the time. (Laughter.) But guess what? It's working. (Applause.)
Our economic plan -- made possible by all of you in this room, and that's not hyperbole -- created more than 13 million 400 thousand jobs -- new jobs since I took office. Nearly 800 -- (applause) -- nearly 800,000 manufacturing jobs.
Where is it written that America can't create the most vibrant and innovative economy and be the world's leading manufacturer again? Where is that written? I didn't see that anywhere.
We've created more jobs in two years than any administration has in a single four-year term. And I'm very proud -- (applause) -- and I'm very proud that unemployment has been below 4 percent for the longest stretch in over 50 years. (Applause.) Below 4 percent and going down.
We now have more jobs than we did before the pandemic. And workers aren't just finding more jobs, they're finding better jobs, higher pay, higher job satisfaction. And unemployment is down and so is inflation.
Remember what the experts told us, okay? And they're traditional economists, very smart women and men. They told us getting inflation under control, in order to do it, we had to lower wages and increase unemployment. Not a joke. Had to lower wages and increase unemployment.
But we never, never, never thought the problem was too many people -- I -- at least, I didn't -- too many people that were working or that working people were making too much money. I just thought that was not the best answer to how to get it down.
Now, one reason we've seen inflation fall by two thirds without losing jobs is corporate profits are coming back down to earth. The excesses are being eliminated by the corporations.
We have more to do, but inflation is now at the lowest point it's been in two years.
When the Inflation Reduction Act was passed a year ago today, inflation was -- as pointed out by Chuck or Nancy; I can't remember which one -- 8.3 percent. It's now down to 3.2 percent -- (applause) -- the lowest amount -- and it's going to go lower.
But here's the point: It's lowest among the world's leading economies. Take every major economy in the world. We have the lowest uninflat- -- inflation rate.
At the same time, wages are growing faster than inflation, and this matters.
The way I think about inflation is the way my dad used to talk about it around the kitchen table. Not a joke. I'm being deadly earnest about this. He'd ask, ""How much is left after all the monthly bills are paid? How much do you have left over after you pay them all? And is there -- at the end of the month, just to have a little bit of breathing room. Just a little bit of breathing room.""
That's one of the reasons why we've worked so hard dealing with Pharma and other things. Not only do you get the overall cost of average people and the monthly bills down, in addition to inflation, the Inflation Reduction Act is giving people more breathing room, as my dad would say. And it's supercharging the economic transition in key ways.
First, it's taking the most aggressive action ever on climate energy -- ever. I've long said -- and I've -- that's why I think all the unions have come along. I've long said: When I think climate -- not a joke -- I think jobs. I think jobs. (Applause.) For real.
And, by the way, none of this would have happened had the unions not stepped up and supported us. The idea -- (applause) -- they wouldn't have. It would not have happened.
This law is one of the biggest drivers of jobs and economic growth this country has ever seen.
Since I took office, the private sector has announced nearly 400 -- excuse me -- $240 billion in new clean energy manufacturing investments. That's private sector -- $240 billion investment. (Applause.)
And the law has already created an estimated 170,000 clean energy jobs in one year. It's estimated that it will -- it will -- that will grow to 1.5 million more jobs over the next decade. First, it was one year. Now we're talking about the decade.
You know, just don't take it from me. The CEO of U.S. Steel called the Inflation Reduction Act ""Manufacturing"" -- he called it the ""Manufacturing Renaissance Act"" because it's bringing jobs back to America, manufacturing here in America. Made in America.
According to leading Wall Street firms Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, my broader investment -- our broader investment in Investing in America agenda is unleashing a boom -- a boom of manufacturing investments.
And we're leaving nobody behind. We're investing in all of America: in the Heartland and coast to coast.
You know, I saw some of our -- a few of my Democratic friends -- not in Congress -- but friends said, ""Look, you're -- you're investing more in red states than in blue states."" Well, I made a commitment. This is about all of America. I was the Pre- -- (applause) -- no, I really mean it.
And we've seen progress across the country, from Maine to South Carolina, to Minnesota, to New Mexico. The Vice President and I and the Cabinet have seen progress across the country.
Just yesterday, I was in Wisconsin at a -- at a company that makes clean energy equipment, including wind turbines. Because of the Inflation Reduction Act, they expect their market in American-made wind turbine generators to double next year.
And, by the way, the guy who was the most ardent opponent of all this was talking about what great benefits are coming to Wisconsin. (Laughter.)
Bless me, Father. I have -- (laughter). I'm going to be a good boy. (Laughter.) I'm going to keep the Irish in me down a little bit here. (Laughter.)
At the same time, we're also boosting our nation's energy security. For years, China dominated the clean energy supply chains. We became -- we let the American jobs and factories go overseas. For how long have we gone through this period where the answer for the previous -- mostly in Republican, but some Democratic administrations -- the answer had been: Find the cheapest labor in the world; go -- close the factory here, build it over there, wherever that is; and then import the product from abroad?
Not anymore. We are building it here and sending the product over there. (Applause.) No, I mean it.
We're bringing -- we're bringing critical supply chains and technologies home for electric vehicle batteries, solar panels, wind turbines, critical minerals.
And because of the CHIPS and Science Act, we've generated $231 billion in private investment, in making semiconductors -- $231 billion. A small -- that small computer chip, the size of the end of your -- your fingertip that affects nearly everything in our lives, from cellphones, to automobiles, to the most sophisticated weapons systems.
You know, we invented these chips. We used to produce these chips. We stopped. And we saw it during the pandemic -- we paid a high price for things that went overseas. Factories shut down; we paid a big price. But now we're bringing semiconductors home.
In 2030, the Inflation Reduction Act is projected to help triple wind power and increase solar power by eightfold. By 2030, electric -- electrically deployed -- excuse me, electricity deployed through the U.S. power grid is expected to be powered by 81 percent clean energy. Do you hear me? Eighty-one percent clean energy. (Applause.)
Imagine the impact on climate and the air we breathe. The law is going to help meet all of my bold climate goals by cutting carbon pollution in half by 2030 -- in half by 2030. (Applause.)
And between the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we're investing more than $50 billion to build up resilience in impacts on climate change.
These laws support important priorities, from addressing historic drought along the Colorado River Basin. Remember when I said we had a concern about the Colorado River literally going dry? You all thought I was crazy. I wish I had been. But guess what? I was just out there and looking down on the Grand Canyon. And guess what? It's coming back.
But any rate, we're responding to coastal erosion, sea level rise in the Gulf of Mexico, and helping reduce the effects of extreme heat by investing nearly $1.5 billion to plant trees and expand community parks and forests.
Folks, there's a lot more, and you've heard a lot today, and I'm going to not go into it all. But this law is helping mem- -- families save thousands of dollars on energy bills every year through the tax credit and rebates to buy new and efficient electric appliances, weatherize their homes, install heat pumps, rooftop solar.
As a consequence of this, it's estimated that the consumer is going to save at least $27 billion in electric bills between now and 2030. (Applause.)
We're also offering tax credits up to $7,500 to buy new electric vehicles -- and I've worked it out with the European Union -- (laughter) -- and fuel cells made here in America.
For the first time, we can get a tax credit to buy used electric vehicles. And thanks to the law, new electric vehicles are going to save -- this is -- this is a fact, if we do this -- and we're doing it now -- tens of billions of gallons of gasoline between now and 2030. That's a lot less pollution. (Applause.)
And I'm not even going to start to talk to you about Amtrak. (Laughter.) It's going to save billions of dollars -- and I really mean it -- in energy costs. But we'll get into that later. (Laughter.)
Let me be clear on this point: When I say climate means jobs, I mean good-paying union jobs. (Applause.)
And the law -- and the law will give an added boost to clean energy products that pay a prevailing wage, employ registered apprenticeships, and use made-in-America parts and products, and not violate any international trade agreements. It's all in the law.
And we're rein- -- we're reincentivizing companies to build clean energy projects in the same communities that powered our nation with fossil fuels. We owe them -- whether it was Scranton, Pennsylvania, or West Virginia or wherever it has been. The fos- -- they've -- they've supplied the fossil fuels we needed for generations.
For example, next generation batteries are being made in an old steel mill in West Virginia. Solar panels are going to be -- to go -- going to a closed coal plant in New Mexico.
These incentives are going to help make clean energy jobs good-paying union jobs and ensure the benefits of clean energy economy reaching communities left behind. And they're left behind -- when they left behind, they lost their pride. They lost a sense of who they were. They lost what was going on. To reach communities too often left behind -- and that's the focus.
And we're already seeing it happen. Laborers and carpenters are building solar farms. Iron workers and operating engineers building wind projects. Electricians installing solar panels and electric vehicle chargers. By the way, 500,000 of those suckers. And it's going to mean a lot. And it's a big deal.
The clean energy economy should also be a win-win for auto companies and union workers. You know, as the Big Three automakers and companies -- the United Auto Workers negotiated a new collective bargaining agreement, I'm asking him to work together to forge a fair agreement.
Together -- together, we can make this transition to a clean energy future fair and just. And that means ensuring that auto jobs continue to be good jobs that can su- -- you can support a family on. (Applause.)
But auto companies honor the right of workers to organize, taking every possible step to avoid painful plant closings. And that when transitions are needed, they are fair and designed to retool, reboot, and rehire the same -- in the same factory and communities at a competitive wage while the existing workers get the first shot to fill those jobs. That's only fair. It matters.
Second, because the Inflation Reduction Act, we're -- we're -- we're talking about lifesaving steps to reduce healthcare costs. It locks in place the lower healthcare premiums for millions of American families under the Affordable Care Act, saving them an average of $800 a year.
And I see my friends in the Congress who saw that -- in the Senate and House who saw that -- make that happen.
Plus, we pay more for our prescription drugs than any country -- major country in the world. The cu- -- the product made here in the United States sold in Montreal or Paris or anywhere around the world is cheaper than it's made here, where it was -- where it's been produced.
For years, many of us have been trying to give Medicare the power to negotiate lower drug prices, which would reduce, by the way, the federal deficit at the same time. Because when Medicare doesn't have to pay the high price, guess what? It cuts your taxes. It cuts the amount of money that the federal government has to pay.
For years, Big Pharma won. Big Pharma blocked us. But not this time. (Applause.)
I know I don't look it, but I've been arou- -- I've been around for 400 years. (Laughter.) And I've been fighting Pharma on this since the 1970s. No, not a joke.
This time, we finally beat Big Pharma. Medicare finally has the power to negotiate lower prescription drug prices, like the Department of Veterans Affairs has -- had the power.
That's not all. We've heard -- you've heard -- this was already spoken to: insulin. Companies pay -- it costs -- and, by the way, the guy who invented the insulin, he never patented it because he wanted it available for everybody. It never was patented.
And guess what? It costs 10 bucks to make. And if you use everything including packaging, it could be as high as 12 and a half dollars. Now those companies are charging 30 times that amount.
Now seniors on Medicare -- and, by the way, it should be beyond seniors and Medicare, but I'll come back to that at another time -- were paying as much as $400 a month for insulin. And they're now just paying 35 bucks a month.
We're also capping total out-of-pocket expense for drugs for seniors on Medicare to $2,200 a year -- $2,000 a year for even the expensive cancer drugs that could cost as much as $10-, $12-, $14,000 a year. Combine all the costs of their drugs, by 2025, they'll never have to pay more than a total of $2,000 after 2025. (Applause.)
One -- one in three -- one in three seniors on Medicare is going to save an average of $400 a year. Seniors with the highest drug costs are going to save an average of $2,500 a year. And the Pharma companies are still going to do very, very well.
The laws require that drug companies will raise prices faster than inflation. If they do that, they're going to have to pay the difference back to Medicare. That'll create an incentive to keep prices from skyrocketing. And negotiating drug prices alongside other parts of the law will save the federal government $160 billon -- reducing the cost of government by $160 billion.
It will lower the federal deficit because it means -- what happens here is Medicare is going to be paying less for the prescription drugs they deliver to the American people. So, it not only lowers cost for the -- for the person receiving the drug, it lowers the cost for taxpayers -- lowers the cost for taxpayers.
And it gets to a third win for the American people with this law: We've made all the progress without raising taxes on the middle class.
I made a commitment -- and some thought it was too -- too much of a commitment; it's too high -- that no one making less than $400,000 a year will pay a single penny more in federal taxes. It's a commitment I've kept so far. And as long as I'm president, I will keep it.
Unlike the last president, in my first two years in office, we actually cut the federal debt -- deficit by $1.7 trillion. You hear me? The first two years -- we cut the debt [deficit] by $1.7 trillion. (Applause.)
And through this law, we're going to continue cutting the deficit and cutting subsidies to Big Pharma and ensuring the wealthy and big corporations begin to pay their fair share of federal taxes.
Does anyone here think that the tax system is fair? In 2020 -- you remember, I was a pain in the neck about this; I know -- there were 55 of the largest corporations in America who paid zero in federal taxes -- 55 of the 500 -- of the Fortune 500. And they made $40 billion in profit. Didn't pay a penny.
Not anymore. The law requires a minimum tax of 15 percent on our biggest corporations and a 1 percent excise tax on stock buybacks when they pay profits to shareholders.
The law also saves money by cracking down on super-wealthy tax cheats, making sure billionaires -- who pay -- by the way, there's about a thousand now. We used to have 750 before the pandemic. By the way, if you're going to be a billionaire -- not a problem. I'm -- I'm a capitalist. I also was listed for 36 years the poorest man in the Senate, but that's a different issue. (Laughter.) But billionaires and the biggest corporations should at least pay the taxes they owe.
Do you know what the average tax on a billionaire in America is today -- federal tax? 8.2 percent.
You know, a janitor makes -- pays a higher tax than that.
Folks, this law is transformative. And it feel -- you know, it fell entirely to Democrats to deliver it. I hope we've seen -- with all the people out there claiming the credit for it -- they've decided that we're going to -- they're going to join the fight. They're going to join the fight.
I took a -- I guess I shouldn't get into that. (Laughter.) But one congressperson, who has been particularly strident about me, laid out all that we did. We just took it and used it as an ad. (Laughter and applause.) You think I'm kidding.
Look, the idea that not one single Republican voted for it -- you know, I -- and I know my colleagues know this, and I -- I've had seven of my Repub- -- former Republican colleagues in the Senate come to me and say they agreed with us. And -- but I promised I'd never say their names, and I never will tell anybody. But the reason they did that was -- they said, ""Joe, if I vote for X, Y, or Z, it's going to -- they're going to primary, and it will cost me my election.""
Not a lot of political courage, but an explanation as to why there's a lot of people who believe what we're doing is right, but just -- they're a little worried in this environment.
In fact, Republicans have repeatedly tried to repeal key parts of the Inflation Reduction Act, including the Speaker of the House now -- taking credit for the billions of dollars in private investments and thousands of jobs coming into their states.
That's okay. I ran for president, and I said I would represent all Americans. And like I said at the State of the Union, ""I'll see you at the groundbreaking."" (Laughter.) You think I'm kidding. (Laughter.) You know I'm not.
Let me close with this. I'm not here to declare victory on the economy. Our economy is stronger and better than any industrial nation in the world right now. We -- but we have more work to do. We have a plan that's running -- turning things around. The Inflation Reduction Act is a part of that plan.
Bidenomics is just another way of saying ""restoring the American Dream.""
I believe every American willing to work hard -- and I mean this from the bottom my heart. My dad used to say, ""Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck."" I give you my word. ""A lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay,' and mean it.""
Any re- -- any person willing to work hard should be able to get a job no matter where they live, raise their kids on a good paycheck, and keep their roots where they grew up.
How many of you from Midwestern states and border states have found yourself in a position where -- they provide a good education, and you got a -- the son or daughter comes to you, ""Mom, Dad, I've got to move."" When you were governor of Iowa, how many times did you hear that? You have one of the best education systems in the country. ""But I've got to move, Mom. There's no job for me.""
Bidenomics is anchors -- anchored in what's always worked best for the country: investing in America, investing in Americans. Because when we invest in ourselves, when we strengthen the middle class, we see stronger economic growth. It benefits everybody.
Look, folks, I'm proud of the historic law my administration has passed, but it's not about me, and I mean that from the bottom of my heart. It's about you -- all of you in this room, particularly, but the American people. Folks like the ones standing behind me here today.
The most important thing I want to say today is: Thank you, America. Thank you, Americans.
We've faced some tough times in recent years. But you, the American people, didn't give up. You're the ones getting up every single day going to work. You're the ones taking the risks, opening the doors, hiring workers, fulfilling dreams.
And all we hear from our friends on the other side of the aisle is what they claim is what's wrong with America.
Well, let me tell you -- let -- let me tell you: They're telling us America is failing -- failing? They're dead wrong. They're dead wrong. America isn't failing; America is winning.
And I've said it a thousand times -- (applause) -- I've said it a thousand times -- a thousand times: There is no quit in America.
Name me a single objective we've ever set out to accomplish that we failed on. Name me one in all of our history. Not one.
It's never been a good bet to bet against America, and it's still not a good bet today. This is still a country that believes in honesty, decency, and integrity. We're still a country that believes in hard work.
We're still a country that believes that each and every one of us is created equal. We've never fully lived up to it, but we never walked away from it.
And I guarantee you we're still the beacon for the world. You ought to come with me to all these international meetings. Listen to the rest of the world -- what they say to the President of the United States.
Everyday, ordinary people every day get up and do extraordinary things. That's who we are.
America's best days aren't behind us; they're ahead of us. This isn't about the past. It's about the future we're going to build. And I've never been more optimistic about America's future.
Just remember who in God's name we are. We're the United States of America. And there's nothing, nothing, nothing beyond our capacity when we do it together. (Applause.)
God bless you all. And may God protect our troops.
Thank you, thank you, thank you. (Applause.)

Joseph R. Biden, Remarks on the Anniversary of the Inflation Reduction Act Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/364018 ",
2023-08-15 00:00:00,"Remarks in Milwaukee, Wisconsin","
THE PRESIDENT: Hello, Milwaukee! Please have a seat if you have one. (Applause.)
Please have a seat if you -- if you have one. (Laughs.) I said that once earlier in my presidency, and there were no chairs. I couldn't see anyth- -- the press wrote, ""Biden doesn't even know whether people can stand or sit."" (Laughter.)
Anyway, it's great to be here.
Thank you, Valentino, for that introduction. And -- and what you said about the union -- you know, I've said it many times: The middle class built America, but unions built the middle class. And that's a fact. (Applause.)
Governor Evers, Mayor Johnson, County Executive Crowley, thank you all for your warm welcome.
And, Tammy Baldwin, you're the best, kid. You're the absolute best. (Laughter.) If I had another 10 of you, we could rule the world. You'd really -- thank you for all you do, Tammy. Appreciate it very much. And, you know, no one does a -- no one does more to create good jobs in this state and make sure tomorrow's products are made in America.
Now a very quiet, laidback congresswoman -- (laughter) -- who, thank God, is on my side -- (laughter) -- thank God -- Gwen Moore. She never stopped fighting for the people of Wisconsin. (Applause.) I love you, Gwen. You're the best.
And you got two -- you got a mayor and a county executive. I used to work for the county. I was -- used to be a county councilman when I was 26 years old. And I tell you what, I ran for the Senate because it's too damn hard being on the county council. (Laughter.) Everybody comes up to you and goes, ""Yeah, county -- county council. Yeah. Um, uh"" ""You wonder what we do, huh?"" Well, the truth of the matter is: They do a hell of a lot. And your mayor is doing a hell of a job as well. (Applause.)
Look, folks, I apologize, because I try very hard to keep my speeches between 15 and 18 minutes, but I got to talk a little bit about Hawaii.
I've often been on the phone with the governor -- coming up here -- and the senators. And -- and let me say -- address that devasting wildfires, some of which are still burning, in Hawaii.
They've claimed the lives of 99 people so far, and they haven't cleaned things up yet. The deadliest wildfire in more than 100 years. A whole city destroyed. Generations of Native Hawaiian history turned into ruin.
I've spoken with Governor Josh Green multiple times and reassured him the state will have everything it needs from the federal government.
I immediately approved the governor's request for an expedited major disaster declaration. That's a fancy word of saying, ""Whatever you need, you're going to get."" And that will get aid into the hands of people who desperately need it -- who have lost their loved ones; who have lost their homes, their livelihoods; who have been damaged and destroyed.
And think about this: All that area they got to plow up, they can't do it now because they don't know how many bodies are there. They don't know what's left.
Imagine being a mom or dad, wondering where your child is. Imagine being a husband or wife or mother or father. It's really tough stuff.
Almost 500 federal personnel have been deployed to Maui to help communities and survivors get back on their feet.
FEMA search and rescue teams are sifting through the ashes in that five-mile area that you've seen on television that's been burned. It's painstaking work. It takes time. It's nerve racking. Most of the debris can't be removed until it's done.
My wife, Jill, and I are going to travel to Hawaii as soon as we can. That's what I've been talking with the governor about. I don't want to get in the way -- I've been to too many disaster areas -- but I want to go and make sure we got everything they need. I want to be sure we don't disrupt the ongoing recovery efforts.
FEMA Administrator Griswell [Criswell] -- who's the best we ever had, I think -- was on the ground this weekend. I just talked to her. She's back in the States. I have directed her to streamline the process as quickly as possible to help register survivors for immediate federal assistance without delay.
To date, FEMA has approved [provided] five tho- -- 50,000 meals; seventy-five liters -- thousand liters of water; 500 [5,000] beds; 10,000 blankets; and -- as well as other shelter supplies for survivors displaced in -- from their homes.
FEMA also authorized one-time payments of $700 per household to folks who have been displaced so they can do the immediate things of just taking care of medications and prescriptions that they so badly need.
We're working with the state to make sure survivors that have lost their homes have a place to call home until we can rebuild.
We're also surging federal personnel to the state to help the brave firefighters and first responders, many of whom lost their own homes, their properties while they're out busting their neck to save other people. How many have so -- been so impacted themselves? But they're still working around the clock to put the fires out, evacuate survivors to safety, and find the missing.
I have ordered all available federal assets on the island to assist local crews, including the U.S. Coast Guard, the Navy Third Fleet, and the U.S. Army.
In the immediate aftermath, the Coast Guard and Navy supported maritime searches and rescue operations. The Army helicopters helped fire suppression and efforts on the Big Island -- because there's still some burning on the Big Island, not the one that is -- not the one where you -- you see on television all the time. FEMA has deployed more than 140 Urban Search and Rescue personnel as well.
And there are so many organizations to thank, like the American Red Cross, helping survivors missing loved ones. Cellphone providers are making sure first responders can make and respond to emergency calls. Commercial airlines that have evacuated tens of thousands of people from the island.
The list goes on.
And the Small Business Administration has dozens of staff on the island and has begun making low-interest federal disaster loans available to Hawaii -- Hawaii businesses, homeowners and renters, and non-profits to help them begin to rebuild -- just to get by for the immediate near term.
And we're going to coordinate and continue to coordinate relentlessly with the people on the ground to make sure the critical work continues.
In the meantime -- you always hear this phrase; and I've been to so many disasters in my career, it's almost hollow -- our prayers -- our thoughts and prayers are with the people of Hawaii. But not just our prayers. Every asset -- every asset they need will be there for them. And we be -- we'll be there in Maui as long as it takes. As long as it takes. And I meant that sincerely.
We're going to have more to report on this.
But today, I come to Milwaukee to talk about what we're doing to bring manufacturing back home. It's about our progress building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down. You know, when we -- it's that trickle-down economics. Not a hell of a lot landed on my dad's kitchen table. But when the middle works and the bottom has a shot up, the wealthy do very well.
I'm a capitalist. If you can make a billion dollars, go make it. I mean it. Just pay a little more taxes than you're paying right not. Eight percent doesn't quite get it. (Applause.)
But, look, I came to office determined to move away from the trickle-down economics and to focus on the middle class. Because I said when the middle class does well, everybody does well -- everybody does well.
The Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal started calling my plan -- not initially as a compliment -- ""Bidenomics.""
But guess what, folks? They're talking about it differently now. It's working. It's working -- (applause) --
I'm serious -- because we're investing in America.
According to Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, my plan is leading to a boom -- they called it a boom -- in manufacturing and manufacturing investment, as you've seen right here in this factory: over 13.4 million new jobs, 150,000 new jobs in the state of Wisconsin. (Applause.) Nearly 800,000 new manufacturing jobs nationwide. More than 20,000 manufacturing jobs in Wisconsin, from Green Bay to Verona to Pleasant Prairie. (Applause.)
We've added more jobs in two years than any president has in American history in a four-year term. More in two than any has done in four. (Applause.)
And unemployment has been below 4 percent for the longest stretch in over 50 years -- 50 years.
Wisconsin's unemployment rate is just 2.5 percent. That's lower than it was every single month the prior administration. (Applause.)
We've recovered all the jobs lost during the pandemic, and we've added millions more. People are coming off the sidelines and getting back into the workplace.
Remember, a while there, they were saying, ""Well, Biden is just allowing people not to work and get paid."" Guess what? A higher percentage of American workers are working today than ever before. (Applause.)
And while unemployment is down, in case you haven't noticed, inflation is down, too, and it's going lower. (Applause.)
Rememeber -- remember what the experts said? To get inflation under control, you needed lower wages and higher unemployment. Not a joke. Those of you who are economists know that's the economic mantra: To get inflation under control, fewer jobs, more unemployment. That's number one. And making sure that you don't have to deal with -- that's what they say caused the inflation.
But I never thought the problem was too many people working or working people making too much money. And one reason we've seen inflation fall by two thirds without losing jobs is that we're seeing corporate profits come back to -- down to earth.
You know, we've done more -- we've done -- we have more to do with inflation, though. It's just about 3 percent now, and it's predicted to go lower than that. We're near the lowest point in over 2 years.
And at the same time, the pay for low-wage workers has grown at the fastest rate in two decades. Wages are growing faster than inflation.
Folks, that's Bidenomics. It's about growing an economy by strengthening the middle class -- (applause) -- and making things in America again.
You know, it's in stark contrast to the conservative Republican view -- the so-called MAGA view -- which is focused on corporate profits. They say we should find that -- the rationale up to now has been: Let's find the cheapest place in the world to make our product. Let's shut down the corpo- -- the -- the operation in America and send it overseas, and then send the refined product back to America and sell it here.
That's their philosophy. But you know who believes that? Your significant senator, Ron Johnson.
He believes outsourcing manufacturing jobs is a great thing. He's on record as saying he doesn't agree with American work- -- this is what he said: American workers should manufacture -- he doesn't think they should manufacture products that require a lot of labor. Here's what he said, quote, ""Let the billions of people around the world do that."" End of quote.
You wonder why the hell we got ourselves in trouble. (Laughter.)
Well, we've been letting them do that for too damn long. It's time to build American products in America. (Applause.)
You can see how Ron Johnson's rationale and the MAGA rationale worked out. Between the year 2000 and January 2021, Wisconsin alone lost more than 136,000 manufacturing jobs alone.
I'd like to see Senator Johnson talk about those -- to talk to those 136,000 people and tell them it doesn't matter whether you manufacture things at home or overseas.
It sure as hell does, man. (Applause.) Not only for those 136,000 people who lost their jobs, but for their families and the communities and the economic growth it generated here at home.
Let's take a look at how the Johnson philosophy played out -- the real time in Wisconsin, like in Kenosha, about 40 miles from here. There used to be a lot of people assembling automobiles there, making a direct [decent] living for their families, generating economic growth for Kenosha, until the American Motors plant closed in '88.
Or take a look at Milwaukee, known as the manufacturing powerhouse for so long. That's -- when I got to the Senate, I -- I've been around about 200 years. (Laughter.) When I got to the Senate in 1973, Milwaukee was a manufacturing powerhouse. That's how it was referred to. Not a joke. Not a joke.
I don't have to tell anyone in this audience how hard people here work and all of you -- all you -- all you've done to keep this city strong.
Still, by early 2000, Milwaukee had lost around two out of three factory jobs. Eighty thousand jobs were gone. Eighty thousand. And when those jobs were lost, something else was lost as well: pride, a sense of dignity.
My dad -- and I swear to God this was the expression -- used to have an expression. My dad was a high school-educated guy, was well-read, and worked like hell. He didn't have a chance to go to college. He used to say, ""Joey"" -- and this is the God's truth -- ""Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about dignity. It's about respect. It's about being able to look your child in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay,' and mean it."" That's what a job is about. That's what a job is about. (Applause.)
And when the breadwinner in the family loses their job, they lose their pride and the sense of dignity that goes with that.
And people like Ron believe that is a good thing -- that corporate American bottom line is that that's all you need to look at; it's good for America.
Well, that's not my bottom line.
From the day I took office, I was determined to turn it around with -- with now they're calling ""Bidenomics."" It's one of the reasons why I fought so hard to write and get passed the CHIPS and Science Act. (Applause.)
We used to invest more in science and research than any country in the world: almost 2 percent of our gross domestic product. Now it's about seven tenths of 1 percent we invest.
We're the best engineers in the world. We're the best scientists in the world. We're the best researchers in the world. What the hell are we doing?
Well, guess what? That CHIPS and Science Act has generated $231 billion in the last 18 months in private investments, making semiconductors here in America. (Applause.)
And, by the way, we -- the United States -- invented those semiconductors. We invented them when we went to the Moon.
They're those small computer chips, the size of the tip of your finger, affecting nearly everything in our lives, from cellphones to automobiles to the most sophisticated weapons systems in the world.
Let me give you one concrete example.
I met with the chairman of the largest chipmaker in the world in South Korea -- it's called SK -- when I was in South Korea. They're investing, now, $22 billion -- billion -- in America. And I asked them why. This is the God's truth. ""Why America?""
And he said, ""Number one"" -- think of this now. Remember it. ""Number one, there's no safer place in the world to have my investment than the United States of America. And number two, you have the best workers in the world."" And he's right. (Applause.) That's the -- that's the truth. (Applause.)
It's about time Ron Johnson and his friends understood that.
Look, folks, they think you want to IBEW -- I wouldn't be standing here this time without you guys. But the IBEW, they think -- the average American, they're not being mean or anything, they think, ""Well, to be an electrician, you say, 'I want to be an electrician,' and you get a -- you get a card.""
Four to five years of apprenticeship. You hear me? Like going back to college. Four to five years. You get paid, but not nearly what you get paid when you get your card.
You got to talk more about what you do and what it takes to get it done. People aren't trying to be mean. They just don't know. But I'm sure in hell telling them. (Laughter and applause.)
The bottom line is: We invented chips here in America. We used to produce them here. We used to produce 40 percent. And now we're bringing them back home, thankfully. (Applause.)
Thankfully, we have people like Tammy Baldwin, who championed -- (applause) -- no, it's the God's truth -- ""Buy American"" policies, leading a resurgence in manufacturing in Wisconsin and across the country.
You heard me say it before: Where in God's name is it written that America can't lead the world again in manufacturing? Where is that written? Folks --
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Nowhere!
THE PRESIDENT: Nowhere. You got it.
Since I took office, we've attracted more than one half trillion dollars -- let me say it again -- one half trillion dollars in private investment in American manufacturing and the industries of the future.
Spending on construction of manufacfur- -- to manufacturing plants that need to be built nearly doubled in the last two years.
And, you know, that's not just -- that's not just the permanent jobs -- they're generating growth -- economic growth and buil- -- look, construction jobs do that as well. We've added 600,000 good-paying construction jobs since I took office.
When they build these -- these plants to build these chips, guess what? They call them ""fabs."" They're as big as football -- long as football fields. That's how big they are. They're gigantic. And guess what? The people who work there -- you know what the average salary is in these fabs? $116,000 a year. Adfsend you don't need a college degree.
What the hell are we talking about? (Applause.)
Folks, instead of exporting American jobs, we're creating American jobs and exporting American products. And they're being built right here in Wisconsin and places where factories had been shut down.
Look at what you're doing here. Ingeteam came to Milwaukee 10 years ago, thanks to tax incentives in clean energy during the Obama-Biden administration.
Then, exactly one year ago tomorrow, I signed a significant piece of clean energy legisla- -- combining -- combatting the existential threat of climate change -- the single largest investment ever, anywhere in the world, without one single member of the other team voting for it. That law reauthorized those clean energy tax credits and expanded them.
As a result, this com- -- this company -- this company predicts that demand for the wind turbine generators, which they're making right here in this facility, will double next year. (Applause.)
And since I took office, the private sector has announced more than $3 billion in investments -- not million, billion -- in investments for wind energy manufacturing in America. And, by the way, it's cheaper -- cheaper -- cheaper than fossil fuels. (Applause.) Cheaper than fossil fuels.
And that's not all.
Until this year, this company didn't think it made sense to make chargers for electric vehicles in the United States. But then, when I signed the Bipartisan Infra- -- Law -- again, which -- which Ron Johnson and his friends didn't vote -- they all voted against -- that law invests $7.5 billion to build a network of thousands of electric vehicle chargers stretching across the country, including on I-94.
By the way, over 500,000 of these charging stations. That's real jobs. That's real money.
And, by the way, my Grandpop Biden, who died very young -- he was -- died in the hospital I was born in six days before I was there -- I mean before I was born -- he worked for the American Oil Company. His job was to go from town to town, expanding the American Oil Company, building new gas stations. People didn't know whether they wanted a couple thousand gallons of gasoline under the ground where they are.
What happens when you build a gas station? You end up with something like a 7/11 or a doughnut shop or a drugstore around it. It generates economic growth. We're going to be building these facilities all across America so you can plug in and go the width of the country. That way you can travel coast to coast without worrying about running out of power.
Every single one of these chargers must be installed by workers certified by the IBEW plan. Every one. That was a condition. (Applause.) Every one. And every single one must be made in America. (Applause.)
You know, there's a provision in the law that -- I thought I knew a fair amount. But I didn't realize -- maybe you did, Tammy, but I didn't realize, back in the '30s, they passed a law that's consistent with international trade that if the Congress passes a law to spend money and the President has to decide where to spend it, he has to -- he or she has to spend it on American workers and in -- in America -- American products.
Well, most presidents, including Democrats, didn't pay a lot of attention to that. But I did. (Laughter and applause.)
And so, now, to use a non-American product, you've got to have a real good reason, prove to me you can't in fact get it from an American product.
Look, folks, this company concluded that it was an opportunity for them as well. And now, they're making fast-charging EV chargers here in America, right in Wisconsin. (Applause.)
Their goal is to manufacture 13,000 high-speed chargers every single year. And guess what? To the chagrin of your senator -- the other senator -- it's going to add 100 good-paying jobs. (Applause.)
And, folks, this is happening across the state. It's a direct result of those clean energy investments I signed into law a year ago.
Folks, as I've said for a long time -- for a long time: When I think climate, I think jobs. Not a joke. When I think climate, I think jobs. That's the future.
By the way, Texas -- the state of Texas has a very enlightened governor. The very state of Texas has the signifi- -- highest number of wind and solar facilities, I think, of any state in the nation. And it's cheaper than -- than fossil fuel. He wants to shut them down. Isn't that enlightened?
Like the 12 solar energy products in -- Alliant Energy is building across Wisconsin, creating more than 2,000 jobs -- local construction jobs -- most of them union jobs -- and, in the process of serving customers in Wisconsin, saving them more than $1.6 billion in energy costs. These are facts, not fiction.
And back to Kenosha, which was hit hard by the American Motors when it closed, now Paris Solar has broken down in the state -- broke ground on the state's first large-scale solar and battery storage project in Kenosha County. It's creating 300 good-paying construction jobs. Three hundred. (Applause.)
And just today, the company Siemens announced that because of that law I signed and the significant investments we're making in clean energy, they're going to begin manufacturing solar inverters here in Wisconsin. (Applause.)
And, by the way, the American people are going to be learning -- no matter how well educated, you're going to be learning a lot, because I bet most people don't know what a solar inverter is. It converts solar energy from the sun into electricity. Kind of a novel idea, isn't it?
How many times did you ever think, in those days when you had those real big bills in the winter and a hot day came, ""Well, why couldn't we capture all this?"" Well, guess what? They're going to be doing a piece of that. Sunlight shines down, and the inverter turns it into electricity. And they're going to build them just outside of Kenosha.
Don't tell me Americans can't innovate. Don't tell me that.
Since I took office, I've seen more than $3 billion in private investment in clean energy manufacturing, all across Wisconsin. That's Bidenomics. That's investing in America. (Applause.)
Totally consistent with international law and trade agreements.
And investing in America means investing in all of America.
When I ran for president, I made a promise that I would leave no one behind, no part of the country would I leave behind.
I'm getting mad -- a lot of Democrats are getting mad at me because we're investing actually more in red states than blue states right now. But they're all Americans, and I made a promise. I made a promise: no matter where.
And folks, red states, blue states, urban, suburban, or rural -- all of that will benefit from what we do.
That's why I launched the Rural Partners Network to help rural communities, including here in Wisconsin and my state of Delaware -- which is mostly rural, believe it or not -- create jobs and economic opportunity.
And my administration has invested hundreds of millions of dollars to support small- and medium-sized meat and poultry processors across the Midwest, including dozens here in Wisconsin, from Lancaster to Richland Center to Soldiers Grove.
This way, farmers can get the best price for their product. They don't have to deal with the only giant processor that pays them less for what they need -- what they're do- -- (applause) -- no, I mean it.
And that wasn't my idea. That was the Secretary of Agriculture, the former governor of Iowa.
But, folks, that's not all. We're also investing $230 million in Wisconsin to support agriculture that's good for the environment, like planting cover crops that replenish the soil with nutrients and absorb carbon from the air. We're helping farmers, ranchers, foresters get paid for doing the right thing.
It's simple, folks: When farmers do well, when the wealth they generate stays in Wisconsin, then their children can stay in Wisconsin and find opportunity here and build a stronger rural economy. (Applause.)
Investing in America also means rebuilding our infrastructure. The governor talked about how many bridges and roads -- I mean, it's amazing. And it's not even been a year yet. It's just been about a year.
You know, the last guy who talked about ""Infrastructure Month""? We got ""Infrastructure Decade,"" baby. (Applause.) Ten years. Y'all think I'm kidding. They never had one month.
But I'm jo- -- I'm not joking.
And, by the way, a number of my Republican friends voted against this infrastructure bill, including your distinguished other senator.
You know, we used to be number one in the world in infrastructure, but, over time, we slipped to the 13th best infrastructure. Thirteenth best infrastructure in the world from number one.
How can you be the best economy in the world with a second-rate infrastructure? Not a joke. How can you do that?
Well, through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we've already announced 37,000 projects, 4,500 communities across America, including hundreds of projects, as the governor referenced, right here in Wisconsin. (Applause.)
Let me give you a couple of examples.
We're investing $80 million to replace the interstate bridge over the Wisconsin River in Columbia County. That's a major route connecting people to Milwaukee, Madison, and Chicago.
And look across town, where union workers are building North Holton Street Bridge, which is nearly 100 years old. More than 10,000 vehicles travel over it every single day across the Milwaukee River. It's dangerous, and this reconstruction is long overdue. (Applause.)
You were -- a lot of you were with me when I was in Pittsburgh. And, by the way, the -- Pittsburgh is ""the city of bridges."" More bridges in Pittsburgh than any other city in America. I watched that bridge collapse. I got there and saw it collapse with over 200 feet off the ground, going over a valley. And it collapsed.
Thank God school was out during the -- during the pandemic. Imagine all the people who would've died. They knew for years they had to do something, but we're talking hundreds of millions of dollars to rebuild it.
You know, I know everybody kids me because I'm an Amtrak guy. I like rail. (Applause.) Well, I've traveled over 1,280,000 miles on Amtrak. And I know you think that's nuts. I do, too, but my -- (laughter) -- and the reason for that is: When I got elected, I was 29 years old. I was in an office hiring staff, and I got a phone call saying my wife and daughter were dead and my two boys were not likely to live. A tractor trailer broadsided and killed them.
And I didn't want to stay in Washington. So, I said they -- a lot of really good senators, including a couple good Republican friends -- became friends -- said, ""Just come and stay six months; help us organize."" Hell, we had -- we had 58 Democratic senators already and a Democratic governor. I didn't know any better.
But I stayed. And I started to commute every day, because having been listed as the poorest man in the Congress for 36 years -- true. My wife called me one day and said, ""Did you read the paper today?"" And I was up campaigning for a guy named Pat Leahy in Vermont. I said, ""No, honey. I didn't see the Wilmington paper."" She said, ""Headline, above the fold"" -- only a politician's wife would say that -- (laughter) -- ""'Biden, poorest man in Congress.' Is that true?"" Like I was cheating on her or something. (Laughter.)
But I was. And I couldn't afford a house in Washington, and I couldn't afford a house in Delaware. If I sold my house in Delaware, I would lose the election. So, I started to commute. It's only 300 miles a day, but it still takes me an average of four hours, beginning to end.
And so, what happened was I -- when -- when you travel as Vice President on Air Force planes, they keep a precise number of miles you travel. And I guess it was in my seventh year or sixth year as vice president, I -- there was a headline in a New York paper saying, ""Biden travels almost 1,200,000 miles on -- on Air Force planes."" One -- one million two -- one hundred, or whatever.
I'm getting on the train one day with the -- the Secret Service are the best in the world. They don't like me traveling on the train because there are too many opportunities for people to do bad things on trains. And so, I'm getting on a train to go home and see my mom, who was sick and in hospice in my home.
And this guy -- I won't mention his name, because they -- it would get him in trouble. But one of the senior guys in Amtrak who I rode -- rode with all the time comes up and goes, ""Joey, baby,"" and grabs my cheek. (Laughter.) I swear to God, I thought they were going to shoot him. (Laughter.)
And I said, ""No, no, no, no."" I said, ""What's the matter, Ang?"" He said, ""We just -- I read this thing about a mil- -- over a million miles on Air Force planes."" He said, ""Hell, you know how many miles you traveled on Amtrak?"" I said, ""No, Ang. I don't know."" He said, ""We just had a retirement dinner up in Newark."" He said, ""You traveled a hundred -- an average 117 days a year, round trip, 300 miles a day, 36 years. That's 1,285,000 miles. I don't want to hear any more about the Air Force."" (Laughter and applause.)
True story, I swear to God.
I'm getting off point here, but anyway. (Laughter.)
But rail saves a lot -- electric rail saves a lot of energy -- a lot of energy and the environment.
Thanks to the infrastructure law, we're providing $23 million to upgrade and modernize Mitchell International Airport, which is going to increase economic activity in Milwaukee. (Applause.)
We're also removing every single lead pipe in Wisconsin -- (applause) -- every single one. These lead pipes are dangerous.
Some of you may remember, I had a guest at the last State of the Union when I was speaking, and it was a young woman named Deanna Branch. She's a Milwaukee mom. She had her 3-year-old son, Aidan, with her, who was hospital- -- twice for lead poisoning because of lead pipes in their home.
Well, guess what? We're removing every single lead pipe in Wisconsin out of the ground. (Applause.) That's a fact. They're a risk to everyone's health, especially to our children's.
And then, over 250,000 homes and small businesses across Wisconsin don't have access to high-speed, affordable Internet. No parent should have to sit outside a McDonald's when we have a -- schools are closed to be able to get on McDonald's Internet so the kid can do their homework. Not a joke. Well, guess what? They do if you don't have Internet at home.
That's why we're investing over $1 billion in every corner of this state, especially rural communities and family farms, with affordable high-speed Internet. Every single home. (Applause.) And folks, all our high-speed Internet projects must use products and construction materials made in America. (Applause.)
Look, folks, it's really kind of basic. We just decided to invest in America again. That's what it's all about.
I want you to see exactly what we're making these investments across the country. If you want to know exactly where they are, you can go on the Internet. Go to: Invest.gov. Put in your location and find out what's happening -- exactly what's happening or scheduled to happen.
Folks, we've done all this without raising anybody's taxes making under 400,000 bucks. (Applause.)
My friends talk about the ""Big Spendin' Biden."" Well, guess what? I made a promise: I'll never raise federal tax on anyone making less than $400,000 a year. I kept my promise. (Applause.)
And unlike the last President, in my first two years in office, even with all we've done, I'm the first one to cut the federal debt [deficit] by $1 trillion 700 billion. (Applause.) One trillion seven hundred billion dollars cut because we generated the growth.
Folks, every Republican voted against our clean energy investment, known as the Inflation Reduction Act. The vast majority voted against the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. But that didn't stop them from claiming credit for protecting the health of their constituents that are getting rid of lead by -- getting rid of lead pipes or putting to work and building new roads and bridges.
Look, I think the vast majority of my Republican colleagues in the Senate know better. We got to stop the partisanship. We've got to stop this stuff.
This legislation they opposed or attack is now the greatest thing to come to their states. You know, there are -- you have Marjorie Taylor Greene -- you know, the very quiet lady from North Caro- -- from -- from Georgia. Well, she's talked about, ""What Biden is doing is what Roosevelt did and what Kennedy did and what"" -- I thought, ""Well, yeah."" (Laughter.)
But, look, folks, like I said: I made a commitment, because I knew this was going to happen. I knew what would happen is the folks who voted against these things -- and we barely passed them, sometimes by one or two votes -- when it came to their states, would claim credit.
I want them to get credit. That's okay. It's okay, as long as they continue to support the things we're doing.
You know, I re- -- I said I represent all the American people in red states and blue states, but that doesn't mean I can't make fun of the hypocrisy -- (laughter) -- of those claiming credit. And like I said in the State of the Union, I'll see them at the groundbreakings. (Laughs.) (Applause.)
Look, let me close with this. I'm not here to declare victory on the economy. We're not there yet. We have more work to do, but we've always had a plan that turning things around, making in -- America stronger and safer and more competitive.
Bidenomics is just another way of saying ""restoring the American Dream."" That's the ba- -- that's what it is, just restoring the American Dream.
I believe every American willing to work hard should be able to get a job no matter where they live -- in the heartland, small towns; raise their kids on a good paycheck; and keep their roots where they grew up.
That's the American Dream. That's Bidenomics.
It's rooted in what has always worked best for this country: investing in America, investing in Americans. Because when we invest in our people, when we strengthen the middle class, we see stronger economic growth that benefits all Americans.
The most important thing I want to say today is this: Thank you. Not thank you for how you voted, but thank you to the people of Wisconsin. Thank you to the American people.
We've faced some pretty tough times in recent years. The pandemic took over 1 million lives. How many empty chairs are there sitting around dining room tables these days? Our neighbors, our friends, our fellow Americans -- they're still living in pain and loss and isolation caused by the pandemic.
It generated the most severe economic crisis since the Great Depression. It wasn't that long ago that 20 million people in America were out of work.
But today, the American people -- they didn't give up. Wisconsin didn't give up. Americans didn't give up. America didn't give up.
And I've said it a thousand times: There is no quit in America. There is no quit in America. Look how far we've come. (Applause.)
Today -- today -- it's not hyperbole -- we have the strongest economy in the world. And you're looking at me a little skeptical, but I promise you. Check it out. The strongest economy in the world, the highest job satisfaction in 36 years.
Our inflation rate has dropped to the lowest among major economy -- economic nations in the world. And if we keep it up, it's going to go lower, according to (inaudible).
All I hear from my friends on the other side of the aisle is what is wrong with America. There's a lot wrong with America, like every country. They tell us America is failing, but they're wrong.
Democrats, Republicans, independents, conservatives, liberals -- I don't think they understand the average American. Whatever (inaudible) we set our mind to as a country, we've always accomplished. Name me one thing in American history where America stood together and said, ""We're going to solve that problem"" and we didn't do it. Name me one. Name me one.
There's nothing beyond our capacity.
America isn't failing. America is winning. (Applause.)
And I'm proud of the historic legislation my administration has passed. They were the right steps not only to get our economy moving again but to build to the future.
But the real hero in this story is all of you, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart: the people of Milwaukee, the people of Wisconsin, the American people.
Yes, my policy helped create a lot of these jobs and it has continued to grow, but you're the ones getting up every single day, walking out that door, and doing the work.
Yes, my policies have helped to create some small businesses. We've created more than in any time in history. But you're the ones who decided to borrow the money and take the risk in the middle of this (inaudible). You took the risk to hire workers, fulfilling your dreams.
I've long said it's never, ever, ever been a good bet to bet against America -- never, never, never. And it's not a good bet today.
This is still a country that believes in honesty, decency, and integrity. The vast majority of Americans do. Our political leaders sometimes in both parties don't.
We're still a country that believes in hard work. We're still a country that believes in -- each and every one of us is created equal. We're still a beacon to the world.
That's because small towns and in rural America and suburbs, big cities all across the country, every ordinary perpso-- -- people -- all ordinary people do the most extraordinary things.
Let me tell you, America's best days are ahead, not behind us. Not because of me. Because of you.
It isn't about the past; it's about the future. It's about each of us writing the next chapter in American history.
I can honestly say I've never been more optimistic -- and I mean this from the bottom of my heart -- I've never been more optimistic about America's future, both domestic and foreign.
We just have to remember who in the hell we are. We're the United States of America. There is nothing -- nothing -- beyond our capacity when we do it together.
So, let's do it together, God love ya. (Applause.)
May God bless you all. And may God protect our troops.
Thank you. (Applause.)

Joseph R. Biden, Remarks in Milwaukee, Wisconsin Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/364002 ",
2023-08-10 00:00:00,"Remarks at a Campaign Reception in Park City, Utah","
Please, please sit down. Thank you. Well, first of all, you know, I had forgotten about that incident. It was the time when there was a lot of discussion going on in the administration: Would we recognize same-sex marriage?
And I was raisedI was a lucky man. I was raised by a father who was athought everyone was entitled to be treated with dignity. I remember when I wasI hadn't thought about this a long time. I remember when I was a kid, I was a lifeguard at a country club, but I wanted toI wasgot deeply involved in the civil rights movement. And so I wanted to work in what they called ""The Bucket,"" which was a public housing complexa large complex on the east side of Wilmingtonandwhich was all African American.
And they had thelike all big cities, they had three major swimming pools. One on the east side, which is where theya thousand African American kids a day would come and swim in this big pool. And I wanted to be a lifeguard there.
And so my dad, on the way to work, would drop me off at the city hall to go in and get my application for being the employeethe only White lifeguard thatwell, not at the time, but I was the onlyI wasn't applying to be the only WhiteI just happened to be the only White lifeguard.
And it's in what they call Rodney Square. If any of you have any little corporations in Delawarethere's more corporations in Delaware than every other State in America combined, not a joke. And the fact is that it was a great corporate entity at the time: Rodney Square. There was the DuPont Building, the Hercules Building, and other major buildings around that square.
So I was getting out of the car to go into the city hall. And these two well-dressed men leaned over and kissed one another. And I'd never seen that before. I turned and looked at my dad. And I just looked at him. He said: ""Joey, it's simple. They love each other. It's simple."" And so I got lucky, the kind of dad I had.
And these two little kids, when we walked into this home werewhen I was talking to them, they said, ""I want you to meet my daddy and my mommy,"" and they were two men. And I watched how they loved both those kids and how the kids loved them.
And I told Barack, at the time, that I wasn't going to go out and make it a campaign issue beforehand. But if anybody asked me, I wasn't going to be silent. No one had asked me. [Laughter] No one ever doubts I mean what I sayI mean when I say; sometimes I say all that I mean.
And so I got on the show, and the first question he asked me was that question. I was persona non grata with everyone but Barack for a while because it was thought to be a political liability.
But look, folks, you know, I thinkthis is going sound counterintuitiveI've never been more optimistic about America's prospectsnot because I'm President. I mean that sincerely. I think we're at a genuine inflection point in world history. It happens everyanywhere from 6 to 10 generations. And things change so rapidly that it's not because of any one man or woman, but there'slike it's watching pieces on the chessboard switch around.
Think of all the change that's going to take place just because of the change in populations, the change injust global warming, what it's affecting.
And so I amwhat makes us best prepared to deal with this, in my view, has been the fact that we're the most unique nation in the history of the world. Now, that sounds like hyperbolelike ""We, the United States""every other nation is based on ethnicity, religionsomething that is coherent. We're the only nation in the world based on an ideanot a joke. An idea: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men and women are created equal endowed by their Creator.""
We've never lived up to it, but we've never walked away from it. That was the idea. And it created the institutions. We're a product of our political institutions. That's what has held us together.
And quite frankly, I know I don't look it, but I've been around a long time. [Laughter]
But all kidding aside, I thinkI made a speech when I ran the first time for President in 2020, this last time, at Independence Hall in Philadelphia on democracy. I think democracy is at stake. I think our institutions are being questioned like they've never been before.
You have a President who says if he's reelected, he's going to change the institutional structure of this country. He's made statements, and he means some of it.
And so there's a great deal at stake. But the very thing that many people think is our weaknessis our diversityI think it's our strength. I think it's our strength.
And I think whento make a generic, overarching point, wheneverthere's never been a problem that the United States has set out to deal with we haven't solved when we've done it together. I'm serious.
I was asked not long ago: If you could do anything, what would you do?"" I said, ""I'd cure cancer."" They said, ""Why?"" Because Americans don't believe we can do that anymore. It seems to be the thing that most people think that is the hardest thing to deal with, and they doubt it. I don't. I don't.
And many of you are doctors and clinicians. And you know we're a step away, across the board. That's why I was able to get $6 billion for our cancer research institute, focusing.
My generic point is this: I've never been a big fan of trickle-down economics. No, I'm serious. And it's been a Democratic and Republican basis for[inaudible]for a long, long time.
Not much trickledmy dad was a well-readhe got accepted when he was out of school to Johns Hopkins. Couldn't afford to go and ended up inanyway, make a long story shortbut he was a very well-read man. But my dadmy dad never got to go to school. And he alwaysit was one of his great regrets he didn't get to go to college.
And my dad used to say: ""Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about being able to look your kid straight in the eye and say, 'It's going to be okay,' and mean it."" And he meant it. That's not hyperbole. My word as a Biden. That was part of the mantra that we learned.
And so I've thought I started off with the notion that, from an economic standpoint, we have enormous opportunities. But the best way to make sure that we're able to live in places like thisand I'm not being solicitous, and I mean it seriouslyfor the wealthy to do very wellis if the middle class does well, the poor have a way up, and the wealthy do well.
And so one of the things I did, setting out in our economic policy, is to focus on: How do you build a middle class? What do you do to build a middle class? And if you notice, there's nothere's been noI don't knowhyperbole about the wealthy and all. That's not who I am.
But I am supportive of the notion that middle class people have a shot. And what's the best way to give them a shot? It's provide them access to a decent education.
For example, I met with the Business Roundtable. Many of you know it. Maybe some of you are members. And they asked why I keep talking about spending more money on education.
And I said, ""Well, one of the reasons I do that is because, if you remember, when I was Vice President, I met with 558excuse me358 of the Fortune 500 leaders. I said, 'What's the thing you need most, you think? What's the thing you need the most?' He said, 'That you all set a better educated workforce.' I said, 'You used to pay for it.'""
The DuPont Company used to be the eighth largest company in the world when I wasgot elected as a 29-year-old kid. They bought a new enterprise; they trained their personnel in that new enterprise. We don't do that anymore. We expect the Government to do it, but the Government doesn't expend the dollars to do that.
We learned, for example, if you are able toall the studies that were done in the last 12 years fromthere was a joint studyStanford and Harvardwhat would happenyouand all of you know these numbers I know.
But, for example, if you come from a home where it's a broken home, where parents don't read to their children, where there's not books in the house, or where one of the parents is an addict orthe kid coming out of that home is going to hear a million fewer words spoken by the time they get to first grade. Not different wordswords. They're not engaged in the conversations. They're going to find themselves in position where they're behind the eight ball.
But if you send a kid to schoolreading, writing, and arithmeticat age 3, you improve by 58 percent the prospect of them going all the way through 12 years of school without a problem and getting on and going to community college.
And why are we not doing that? We can afford to do it. I would argue we can't afford not to do it.
And so there's more to be done, in terms of education, than we're doing now. But there's basic things that we haven't focused on, in my view.
And so what I've done in terms of trying to getit used to be thatI was recently in his home State. I was recently out intalking to my old buddy, the former leader of the House in Mainefrom MaineGeorge Mitchell. And I got awarded when I left the Senate as being the most bipartisan Senator in the Senatebeing able to get more done between Democrats and Republicans than any other member of the United States Senate. I'd only been there 36 years at that time. [Laughter]
But all kidding asidebut look what's happened. We barely talk to one another anymore, the way we address one another.
When I announced last time, I said I was running for three reasons. One, to restore the soul of this country. And by that, I meant the same thing that Jon Meacham was talking aboutthe Presidential historianand that is a sense of decency. Just a sense of honor.
Think of the way we talk to one another. Think of the language used in our discoursepolitical discourse, public discourse.
You know, I ride byas I ride through with the on thewhat they call ""the Beast""those big Cadillacs with those flags on itallI get an awful lot of people waving and hollering and wanting to say nice things. But you ride through certain areas, there's these big flags saying, ""Trump"" with ""f-u-c-k"" in the middle of it. And little kids standing there and giving you what we effectively referred to as ""the bird"" when we were kids. [Laughter] I mean, how far have we come?
So, look, one of the things that we did was tosecondly, and to reestablish access for middle class growth.
And thirdly, to bring the country together again, to unite the country.
And that'sthe press is here. And the press understandthey've heard me say this before, and they're honest about how they cover everything. And that is thatthey said thatI got wildly criticized by a lot of major reporters who have otherwise been fairly generous in their references to what I do. Because those days are gone.
If in a participatory democracy we can't bring people together, we're done. We're finished. We're finished as a democracy. And we're falling into campslike warring camps. And so we've got to stop.
And so, look, here's whatin the first 2 years, we were in a situation where we brought inflation down by two-thirds. The Economist and the Wall Street Journal initially started off referencing Bidenomics with sort of tongue in cheek. Well, they're not doing that anymore aboutit's no longer tongue in cheek.
The Bidenomics program is, we've built the economy from the middle out and the bottom up. And today, inflation is down two-thirds. And we've created 13 million jobs in 2 years and 800,000 manufacturing jobs; 3.5-percent uninflation [unemployment; White House correction], the lowest continuous rate in 55 years.
The American Rescue Plan vaccinated the Nation and got the economy moving again. We found ourselves in a position where the bipartisan infrastructure lawremember, we hadwe're going have a excuse me. We were going to have investments in all our infrastructureinfrastructure month. We were going to have that on a monthly basis with the last guy. Nothing happened in 4 years.
Now we havewe have we have infrastructure decade. I got my colleagues in both parties to commit to a 10-year commitment to $1 trillion 300 billion. And guess what? It's attracted an awful lot of investment.
We've attracted private investment investing in America of over a half a trillion dollarsa half a trillion dollars. Many of you were part of that. We're in a situation where they're where we, as I said, the bipartisan infrastructure plan has already generated 37,000 projects. Here in Utah, 60,000 households already are getting affordable high-speed internet. We're in a situation with $28 million for Salt Lake City Airport to resurface the aging infrastructure.
I could go on across the country, but we'reand by the way, not many of my Republican colleagues voted for that piece of legislation. And so thethe distinguished Senator from Alabamathe former coach at the University of Alabama [Auburn University; White House correction]heI was fascinated to see him on television: ""And now I'm about to deliver to the State of Alabama onebillion two hundred and seventy million dollars in internet connectivity."" And he voted against it. [Laughter] I swear to God, he voted against it. So I suggested I go down and help him break ground for it. [Laughter]
But my point is, we're beginning to change. It's going to take time, because people don't know the changes that are taking place are a consequence of what we did yet. And it's going to take a little time for that to break through.
But if you think about itlook, you know, Iwe foundand again, a lot of your business women and men. We found that supply chains matter and access to supply chains matter.
And what did we find out 2 years ago? Well guess what? We invented that little computer chip about the size of athe end my finger heremythe tip of my finger. We're the guys who came up with that ideathat little idea because of the because of the landing on the Moon. That's how we got that far.
And then we made it much more sophisticated. We used to have 40 percent of the market worldwide. Now it's down to 10 percent of the market. And guess what? When the supply chain has dried up because of pandemics in Asia and other places, what happened? Automobile prices skyrocketed, and we couldn't make any moreeverything from your from your cell phone to your washer isneeds to run on these chips.
So I went over to Asia. And everybody thought I was little nuts. I spent some time with the Southwith South Koreans. Got a little company called[inaudible]to invest $100 billion in America. So far we've gotten commitments for investments of over $268 billion in building these factories all across America. We're building one right here in your State.
These are things that are going to generate billions of dollars in revenue, put us in a position where we're not reliant any longer on other countries, and we're the source of being able to make sure we have all that we need.
We're in a circumstance nowfor example, you know, I know there's no global warming. You all know that too. [Laughter] I know there's no global warming. But just in case there is a little global warmingwhat happened was: I had all the major automobile manufacturers on the South Lawn of the White House.
And Mary Barra, the president of General Motors, was suing the State of California for having a higher environmental standard than the Federal Government and said you couldn't do that.
Well, after our little meetingI'm not saying it's because of me, but coincidentally, after our little meeting[laughter]she called me a week later, and she dropped the suit and said they're going to go allhalf the entire production of vehicles by 2030 will be EV. And by 2035, 100 percent.
And you're finding that all across the board, because we have the means and the capability of doing it now. And it's going to fundamentally change the way in which we breathe the air.
We're able toyou know, Ieverybody kids me about being ""Mr. Amtrak."" Well, I've traveled 1,200,000 miles on Amtrak[laughter]for real.
A little story: Iwhen I got elected, I got a phone call. My wife and daughter had been killed in an accident; my two boys weren't going to make it. And so I started to commute back and forth. I wasn't going to stay in Washington. Andbut five Senators got together and said, ""Just stay 6 months."" And here I am. Anywaybut so I started commuting every day.
So I commuted every day for 36 years as a Senator when the Senate was in. I commuted every day, 300 miles a day, every single day. And I estimatedthese conductors went back and got all this data, because they had a big dinner, and showed I averaged 119 days a year, 300 miles a day, et cetera. Then Vice President andand so, I kind of like Amtrak. [Laughter]
But here's the point: We know if you can get onif you can get from point A to point B on rail in the same time it takes to get in the vehicle, you take rail. It would save literally billions of gallons of oil if in fact we hadwe expectso we provided another $45 billion for rail. That's going to just getting underway. You're going to haveanyway, I won't go through the detail. But the generic point is pretty basic.
One of the other things we didmy dad used to say: At the end of the month, for the average, middle class family, it'sdo you haveafter you've paid all your bills, do you have enough left over to have just, what he'd say, ""a little breathing room""? Just a little breathing room.
And even when there's inflation, there's ways to provide breathing room by lowering costs on other items. Now, I have to admit to youI hope I'm not going to offend any of you pharmacists, but the fact is that I think that we should be able to negotiate drug prices, because the VA does that now. And for Medicare, youwe negotiate those prices now.
Well, guess what? Any of you have type 2 diabetes or type 1 diabetes in your family? You were paying between $4- and $800 a month to for that insulin. It costs $10.20 to make it. The guy who invented it did not patent it because he wanted it available for everyonenever was patented. And, in addition to that, if you add the packaging costs, you get up to $13.
So we had a little study done. And guess what? You can buy the insulin now for $35. You make over 600- or 900-percent profit, but it's affordable.
We're negotiating drug prices so that, for example, by the end of 2025, no matter what your cost of your drugsand some of the cancer drugs, as you all knowwe'reall been victims of cancer in our familiesare up to $8,000 a month. Well, guess what? You never have to pay more than a total of $2,000 a month for all your prescriptions.
And by the way, guess what? It saves the Government overclose towell, it's a billionexcuse me, close to $1.8 trillion over time, because that's money we're not paying out from the Government to provide for this. Again, initially controversial, but now even the drug companies are moving along on a lot of this stuff independently.
The end result of a lot of these thingsand by the way, the Inflation Reduction ActI wish I hadn't called it that, because it has less to do with reducing inflation than it does to do with dealing with providing for alternatives that generate economic growth. And so we're now in a situation where if you take a look at what we're doing in the Inflation Reduction Act, we're literally reducing the cost of people being able to make theirmeet their basic needs.
And, for example, we're in a situation where we'reand theabout the Medicare prices, butwell, I'm going to go on too long for you.
But look, some of my friends on the other teamand I met someone today who said: ""I'm a Republican. I'm voting for you. I have a program; I used to be on[inaudible]."" And now he said, ""I'm voting for you."" I didn't ask why. [Laughter]
Any rate, during this process, I've been able to expand the amountI made a commitment that one-third of all the land and waters of America will be in conservation by the time I left officeone-third. It's about 18 percent now.
But what's going on is that in the process of doing this, I'm told of all this incredible amount of money we spend. But guess what? I reduced the debt $1 trillion 700 billion, more than any President has everever, everin American history.
So it'sthis is notsome of it is rocket science, but it's not all rocket science. [Laughter] It's about growth. It's about generating growth.
And folks, you know, I just did an event for another thing I felt very, very strongly about. And granted, it was a little bit parochial, but I've been this way my whole career.
Anyway, my son was the attorney general of the State of Delaware. And hehis National Guard unit was deployed to Iraq, and he gaveyou eitheryou're either Federal property or State property. So he gave up his seat as attorney general to go to Iraq for a year. He came back with a Bronze Star, the Conspicuous Service Medal, and a number of otherbut he also came back having lived next to a burn pit for a total of a year. And he came back with stage 4 glioblastoma.
My generic point is this: We don'twe'rewe have more veterans dyingmore veterans today dying in the last 10 years from suicide than action in the field. More from suicide. And so one of the things we're doing and make sure we did is, we significantly increased the VA budget.
For example, many of those peopleand if you knowyouI bet you know somebody who called and said: ""My son, my husband, my daughter, is having real problems. Can I get her in immediately?"" And they said, ""Well, we have an appointment in a week,"" or whatever. Not a joke. Seventeen soldiers a day committing suicide for the long time now.
So we set up this thing called the legislation that I put together relating to the issue of what the VA can and cannot do. And the legislationI just was at a VA facility here inin the State. And the end result is that we've fundamentally changed the way in which we deal with the VA and anyone who has maybe because I'm of the Vietnam generation: Remember Agent Orange? Well, the problem with Agent Orange was, you couldn't prove whatever you have was a consequence of Agent Orange.
Well, now there's an assumption: If you come back as a consequence of having cancer and having been exposed to these toxic wastesjust like in the 9/11 circumstance, where all those firemen, you know, died of cancer because of what they were doingwell, guess what? Now the families have access to opportunities. They lose the breadwinner in their family, and they can provide for up to $1,000 a month for kids who go on to schoolto college. They can provide for a whole range of things to supplant what they lost as a consequence of these burn pits, which we generated.
We didn't deliberately do it. We didn't know we were doing it. But these are things the size of football fields, 8 to 10 feet deep, where you burn everything from toxic fuels to gasa whole range of things.
I guess what I'm saying is that, you know, we've made somewhat'sit's called the PACT Act. And it's really having a profound impact on the lives of millions of Americansmillions of Americanswho have been exposed.
Now, look, last thing I'll say, because I'm bouncing around too much for you here. I spent most of my time, as the Ambassador will tell you, dealing with American foreign policy. For years, I was the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. And when I was Barack's Vice President, I handled a significant portion of the foreign policy we had to deal with because I knew all these people. I knew the heads of state from being around a long time.
And when I got elected, I took a look at what was happening. There wasNATO was breaking up. Putin haswasand I checked with the intelligence communitywas able to deconflict something so we wouldn't let sources and methods be knownand I predicted he would be invading Ukraine with 150,000320,000 people. And he did. He came in, and he invaded Ukraine, because hishe was absolutely confident he could break up NATOthat NATO would not stick together.
I've had over 180 hours of meetings now with NATO heads of state, and frommost of them in person, initiallybut on Zoom and with direct contactand we've been able to hold NATO together. NATO is stronger today than it ever has been.
If I told you that Germany was going to increase its defense budget, I think you would have told me I was a little crazy. I think if youif I told youwhich I set out to dowe were able to dothat I was going to convince Japan they should increase their budget and helpdirectly help provide aid to Ukraine, you'd say, ""What the hell are they getting involved in Europe?"" Because the world is so damn small, you can't have tens of thousands of troops invade another countryand that's the largest invasion ever since World War IIand not expect it to spread around the world.
And so the bottom line is: We are working in that direction, so we've thus far, essentially, isolated Russia.
And we have China to deal with. And China is a ticking time-bomb in many cases. But it isI'm the only onenow people are beginning to agree: China is in trouble. China was growing at 8 percent a year to maintain growthand now closer to 2 percent a year.
China finds itself in a position where it'sit has the highest unemployment rate going. It's in a position where it'sthe number ofthe number of people who are of retirement age is larger than the number of people of working age. So they've got some problems. That's not good because when bad folks have problems, they do bad things.
Sobut my point is managing China and managing that relationship. And I've spent more time with Xi Jinping than any world leader has. They've kept everythey keep tabs of all of it68 hours of personallyjust he and I with an interpreter eachand another 15 hours on Zoom.
And this is a guy who is awho I think I understand. And this is a guy whowe're not looking for a fight with China. But we're looking for a rationalea rational relationship to have with China.
I don't want to hurt China. But in the meantime, I watched what China was doing. So I put together a thing called the Quad. We brought together as an alliance India, Japan, Australia, and the United States. We put ourselves in a position where now we have the Philippines and, soon, Vietnam and Cambodia wanting to be part of a relationship with us because they'rethey don't want tothey don't want to have a defense alliance, but they want relationships because they want China to know that they're not alone.
So a lot of things are changing, but nothing is done yet. We have to figure out how to deal with Africa. There is going to be a billion people on that continent very shortly. And there arehave some real problems.
But we have enormous opportunities to deal there too, as well. For example, we put togetheror it became known as the Build Back Better initiative. We got together literally billions of dollars in the G-7 nations to provide for alternatives to China'swhat they call Belt and Road Initiative, which is basically a debt and noose agreement that they have. There is not much going on. They're in real debt. They're going in trouble.
So I guess what I'm saying is, we have an enormous opportunity to bring the world together in different configurations than was before in a way that isn't threatening to others and provides a generic stability. And so we're spending a lot of time there. It's not done yet. We've got a lot more to do.
But my generic point is, Iif you read most of the foreign policy experts, you don't see a whole lot of criticism about the approach we've taken to try to deal with thisthese changing pieces inaround the world. It's like, you know, when the North Pole, it doesn't meltlike it melts for real now. But you know, like icebergs break up and theyand when it gets cold, they reconfigure in a different way. That's what's happening around the world.
And so I guess what I'm trying to say to you is that I am optimistic we have an opportunity to leave our kids a world that is more secure, less contentious, and economically more sound than we found it. And I think that's the whole purpose of what I'm trying to do.
And so there is a lot of things that I have not spoken about, from opioids and mental health issues and a whole range of things.
But let me end by this: that I ran for office, as I told you, for those three reasons. And my MAGA Republican friends are trying to take us backtrying to take us back to places that the majority of Republicans don't want to go.
Although, I have seven Senators that are still in the Senateor more than thatthan when I was there. I gave my word I'd never tell who they were, and I'll go to my grave without saying it. But seven of themtwo together came once and then the other five came to me to say: ""I agree with you, Joe. But if I agree with you, then they're going to primary, and I'll lose my seat.""
And so, and you know a lot of your Republican friends aren't happy, but they're not surethey're either scared of Biden andor they're, in fact, worried that they'll cause great difficulty internally.
And so, you know, I truly believe this country is about to take off if we have a little more confidence in ourselvesjust a little more confidence of what we're doing. Not being irrational about it, but realize who we are. We're the United States of America. There is not a damn thing we've ever set our mind to do we haven't been able to donothing when we've done it together.
But this divisionthis division is really, really hurting. And the investments we've made are transformative. And they're going to do something no one thought possible: actually generate real economic growth.
You see what's happening in Europe now. It's beginning to change. You see what's happening ineven in the Middle East. Mark my words: What's goingyou're going to see changes in our relationships with everyone from Saudi Arabia to other countries, because they're all of a sudden realizing they've got problems if they don't change their ways a little bit.
So there's just a lot of reason for hope, but we still need a little bit of luck. Andbut what we don't needwe don't need is an ""America first"" policy.
And a lot of you travel internationally. You won't do it now, but if you travel internationally in your business, raise your hand if you know any world leader in another part of the world you visit that says they want to see Trump come back. No, I'm not being facetious. Can you ever remember thatany other Presidents?
This is the United States of America. There's nothing beyond our capacity. We've got to do it together. And I think we can. I'm going to hush up. Thank you. [Laughter]

2023-08-10 00:00:00,"Remarks on the First Anniversary of the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act of 2022 in Salt Lake City, Utah","
Hello, hello, hello. Please, have atake a seat if you have one.
Sarge, thank you for that introduction. You know, it's important for two reasons. One, I have been in and out of Iraq and Afghanistan over 38 times. And I don't think most people knowthis audience may knowhow many women we have in combat, how many women are not only doing their part, but doing jobs that most people didn't think women would do or could do.
And the Sarge is an example of just that. You know, a Black Hawk helicopter is aanyway. I won't go into it all. But the point is that, you know, Sarge, youwhat happened to you has happened to thousands of people. The Gov and I talked about that earlierthe Governor and Iabout what we're doing here.
You know, you and your fellow veterans are the heart, the soul, and the very spine and sinew of this generation. I mean, that's a fact. You know, only 1 percent of you volunteer to protect all of us. That's what it is. And it's all volunteer.
And I want to thank Dr. Angela Williams and the great team here at the Salt Lake City VA for hosting us and for taking care of our heroes.
Mayor Erin Mendenhall, thank you for the passport into the city. I appreciate that opportunity.
And, Governor Spencer Cox, thank you for your hospitality. But much more importantly, thank you for taking care of our veterans and for bringing along your beautiful family.
And by the way, you know, years agothis is a little ad lib here. But years ago, when John Kerry was the nominee for thefor President of the Democratic Party, he talked with me about the possibility of being Vice President andon his ticket. And I wasn'twe justit was awe were old friends. I said no, I didn't want to be Vice President.
But had I known that as Vice President, I get Secret Service, and had I known that meant my daughters had Secret Service[laughter]and my granddaughters, I would have fought even harder for him at the time. [Laughter]
And now myI have a bunch of grandchildren. They all have Secret Service, and my daughter has Secret Service. And you know, it's just wonderful. [Laughter] I'm not sure what they think about it, but it's just wonderful.
Any rate, thank you very, very much.
Wildfires in Maui, Hawaii 
And look, before I begin, I want to say a word about the devastating wildfires that have claimed at least 36 lives in Maui, in Hawaii. Iwe have just approved a major disaster declaration offor Hawaii, which will get aid into the hands of the people desperatedesperately needing help now. They've lostanyone who's lost a loved one, whose home has been damaged or destroyed is going to get help immediately.
And I've directed that we surge support to these brave firefighters and first responders and emergency personnel working around the clock risking their lives.
I just got off the phone, before I got here, for a long conversation with Governor Josh Green this morning and let him know I'm going to make sure the State has everything it needs from the Federal Government to recover.
The FEMA Administrator Griswell [Criswell; White House correction] will be in Miami tomorrowin Maui tomorrow. And I've directed her to streamline any process which requests for help and survivors registered for immediate Federal assistance without delay. FEMA is surging disaster assistance personnel on the island, and they're going to help survivors get access to Federal assistance.
And you know, anybody who wants to know out there where to goif this is televisedthat they can go to disasterassistance.govdisasterassistance.govto learn if you're eligible for assistance.
And I've ordered all available Federal assets on the islandincluding the U.S. Coast Guard, the Navy 3d Fleet, and the U.S. Armyto assist local emergency response crews from thealong with the Hawaiian National Guard. We're working as quickly as possible to fight these fires and evacuate residents and tourists.
In the meantime, our prayers are with the people of Hawaii, but not just our prayersevery asset we have will be available to them. And we've seenthey've seen their home, their business destroyed, and some have lost loved ones. And it's not over yet.
Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act of 2022 
But now for the reason I'm here today. I've said it many times beforewhen I started saying it 30 years ago, I got criticized occasionally for saying it. I said: We have many obligations as a nation, but we only have one truly sacred obligation, and that's to equip those we send into harm's way and care for them and their families when they come home and when they don't.
One year ago today, we met that sacred obligation when I signedafter fighting so damn hard for the PACT Actto sign it into law. And I want to thank all the veterans organizations for helping make that happen, because it matters.
The PACT Act is one of the most significant laws ever signed to help veterans exposed to toxic materials and theirhelp their families recover as well as receive compensation.
You remember what we mean by burn pits. You know, when we first using the phrase ""burn pits,"" people kind of looked at us. But a burn pit is what you sawbasically, the giant burn pit, the first one everybody was aware of, was in 9/11 when the buildings came down. Remember all those firemen that died of cancer and how wethey got covered? Well, when firefighters first responded, that's what happened.
Now, the burn pits in Iraqwhere we're talking aboutand in other countriesin Afghanistan, even in parts ofthroughout the Middle Eastthey're the size of football fields. A hundredup to 100 yards long, 20 yards to 30 yards wide, and 8 to 10 feet deep. And everything you can imagine is thrown into these pits to incinerate themthe wastes of war: tires, poisonous chemicals, jet fuel, and so much more. Toxic smoke thick with poison spreads through the air and into the lungs of our troops in their hooches, where they lived nearby these facilities.
I know. I've been. I've been there in Iraq and Afghanistan. I've seen them. And you can smell it in the air. You can sometimes see it.
And when these troops came homemany of them the fittest and best trained warriors that we ever sent anywherewere exposed to these burn pits, they weren't the same. And thousands of troops and theirthey had to live in their hooches not far fromproximity from these burn pits.
The one in Iraqmy son was about 400 yards from one of the burn pits, living there for a year in his hooch. They breathe that toxic material sometimes for months at a timein the case of my son and his buddies, for an entire yearcausing headaches, numbness, dizziness, cancer.
This is not about my son, but just an example of how close it was. My son Beau was one of those[inaudible]. He went the fittest guy in his unit and came home andand he came home, but died of glioblastoma. It's personal for my family, but it's also personal for so many of you.
Under SecretarySecretary of the VA McDonough and I just had a long talk. He couldn't be here today, but he can tell you we're determined to address this problem come hell or high water and compensate these veterans and their families who have suffered from the consequence of this tragedy.
It was part of my unity agenda, as I called it, when I did my first State of the Unionlast State of the Union to try to bring the country together on things I thought we all could agree on.
First was beating the opioid epidemic, and we're working like hell on that. Tackling the mental health crisis, and there is a mental health crisis in America. Supporting our veteranssupporting our veterans.
Look, I delivered that speech in March of last year. And a few months later in August, with veterans groups making the case and never giving up, the bipartisan PACT Act was on my desk to sign into law. And don't tell me we can't get things done when we work together. Democrats and Republicans worked together to get that done.
In particular, I want to thank Senator Jon Tester, the chair of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, and Representative Mark Takaexcuse me, Takano, as well, the ranking member of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, for their leadership. They never stop fighting on behalf of the veterans and their families.
We learned a horrible lesson after Vietnam: how harmful effects of exposure to Agent Orange took years to manifest themselves in veterans, leaving too many veterans unable to access care when they needed it and deserved it. And we hadthey had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that that was the cause of their problem, which was difficult to prove in the long term.
That's why I supported the Agent Orange Act of 1991 supporting veterans exposed to the harmful substances in Vietnam.
Well, I didn't want to see that again. The PACT Act means today's veterans and their families won't suffer those same painful, frustrating delays and denials.
And here's what itthe law does: It empowers the Veterans Administration, the VA, to move quicker to determine if a veteran qualifies for the benefits of the lawbenefits like monthly disability compensation and regular toxic exposure screenings.
It also means new facilities, new research, and more health care workers at VA hospitals. It includes nearlyand one of the veterans raised this with me todaynearly $30 million for new outpatient clinics right here in Salt Lake City. Right here.
And for families who have suffered the ultimate loss, it means potential access to life insurance, tuition benefits for their surviving family members, home loan assistance, and monthly stipendswhich cannot replace one breadone of the breadwinners in their home, but it sure in hell can help.
For example, a surviving spouse of a veteran who died from toxic illness with two children could be eligible for roughly $2,300 a month for the rest of his or her life. I'm proud to announce that over 340,000 veteran survivors are already benefiting from the law just 1 year after it was signed, including over 2,000 veterans here in Utah.
Veterans are getting the[applause]veterans are getting the care they deserve in every corner of the country. For example, there's an Army veteran who served in Iraq now receiving care for prostate cancer via theat the VA in Seattle. He heard about the PACT Act, and he applied for benefits the day I signed the law. Because he's already a VA patient, he didn't need to submit medical records or get separate exams. His application was approved, and he's now received retroactive payments from the date the law was signed.
Another Army veteran, now in New Hampshire National Guard, with multiple deployments to Iraq and Kuwait learned that he had a that a friend and soldier she deployed with were diagnosed with breast cancer. Just in case, she decided to get a toxic exposure screening free at all veterans enrolled in the VA health care. She too was diagnosed with breast cancer. They caught the cancer early, and she's currently being treated for it. And she's been granted 100 percent service-connected eligibility under the PACT Act, tripling her monthly payment benefits.
Forfolks, it matters. This matters. Folks, we have a moral obligation. This goes beyond the financial. We have a moral obligation to respond to this. And I'm here today to spread the word so every veteran or surviving family member knows how to access benefits of this law.
And because these conditions have already taken such a toll on so many veterans and their families, I directed the Department of Veterans Affairs to treat all 23 presumptive conditions in this law as applicable immediately, like chronic bronchitischronic bronchitis; asthma; many types of cancer, including any type of reproductive cancer; and something we have been fighting for for a long time: veterans-era veteransVietnam-era veterans are entitled to compensation for hypertension.
This is now the law. And let me give you an example of why it matters.
The widow of a 28-year Army veteran in Connecticut applied for survivor benefits after her husband died from gastrointestinal cancer. That was before the PACT Act was passed, and her claim was denied. In April of this year, she learned about the PACT Act and reapplied. One month later, because of her husband's cancer, she's now presumed to be a service-connected under the PACT Act. Sheclaim was approved. Now, she's eligible for survivor's compensation for her son and further his education and the GI Bill.
I'm urging veterans from these decades of war in Vietnam, and Iraq, Afghanistan to enroll in the VA health care, to get screened for toxic exposure, and to promptly file your claim. And for those watching this homeat home, visit VA.gov/PACTp-a-c-t. VA.govI want to say it againVA.gov/PACT. File a claim or apply for VA health care now.
Or go to your local VA hospital and reach out to the veterans service organizationlike Disabled American Veterans, American Legion, the Wounded Warriors Project, the Veterans of Foreign Warsif you need additional assistance. There is no deadline to submit a claim. But if you want to be eligible to receive retroactive benefits for last year, you have to sign up by Monday.
So apply today. The VA will move as quickly as possible to resolve your claim and get the benefits you deserve.
We're also taking other important steps to help the Nation's veterans and servicemembers. We're helping connect veterans to registered apprentice programs so they can transfer the skills they learned in the military to good-paying jobs here at home, now that we're having the largest building boom in 40 years.
The VA is launching a Transition Assistance grant program for organizations that help veterans and their spouses find jobs when they leave the military. The unemployment rate for veterans has hit an alltime low. It is now at 2.8 percent[applause]2.8 percent. And we're damn proud of that. We've made that a priority since we got into office.
This spring, I signed an Executive order directing the VA to cut redtape and give veterans who need assistance at home more flexibility in picking who will be their caregiver.
Earlier this summer, I went to North Carolina, and I signed an Executive order at Fort Liberty. It'scalls the most comprehensive set of administrative actions in the history of thisand to support the economic security of military veterans, their spouses, caregivers, and survivorslike making it easier for a military spouse to find a job in the Federal Government, expanding access to childcare for military families.
You know, when I first took office, I signed the American Rescue Plan, which invested $17 billion for veterans health care, including mental health care and suicide prevention, to deal with the fact that more veteransmore veteranshave been and continue to die of suicide than in battle over the past two decades. More veterans die of suicide.
And all the stories I heard in my home Statepeople would call up and be looking for help. ""My husband, he needs help. He needs""and couldn't get through. ""We'll get back to you."" Seventeenseventeena day dying of suicide nationwide. Seventeen a day. Even one veteran dying of suicide, particularly because you couldn't get the help immediately, is one too many.
The VA is doing everything it can do, including expanding mental health screening, increasing access to legal and financial support, hiring more mental health professionals, which was onewherewhere's my commander that was here?one that you brought up. We're hiring more. We're hiring.
Including through a proven program that recruits veterans to help other veterans understand what they're going through to get the help they need.
I can noticeif you can stop for another second. You know, one of the things about the military, you're taught to be tough, stand alone, do what you need to do. And it's awful hard when you're having problems and you think you have a mental health problem to ask for help. It's really hard.
There is no difference between having a mental health problem and breaking your arm or your leg. No difference. And you should not be worried about asking for help any more than you would if you had broke your leg. We have to make sure people know there's nothing to be ashamed of in seeking that help.
You know, think about this. I don't know how manyof my tens of thousands of miles that I've traveled through war zones, I don't know anybody who would not wonder whether or not what these veterans have seen causedcould cause posttraumatic stress. It's enormous. It's an enormous problem. They just need help to get through this.
We're working to the end veterans homelessness as well. No one should be homeless in this country, especially not those who served it. Period.
Last year, the VA found permanent housing for over 40,000 veterans and set a goal of permanently housing at least another 38,000 this year. And I'm proposing that the Congress join in and triple the number of rental assistance vouchers for extremely low-income veterans[applause]now. Now. Now.
In securing a bipartisan budget agreement earlier this summer and preventing an economic collapse, we stopped draconian cuts in veteran services. That agreement including dedicated funding for our veterans health so that the health care of those who served so bravely in this country won't be used as a bargaining chip going forward to try to get other things cut.
The agreement also fully funds the PACT Act and expands nutrition benefits that will now be available to our veterans. After serving this Nation, no veteran should go hungry. No veteran should go hungry.
Just 2 weeks ago, I signed an Executive order to significantly strengthen how the military handles sexual assault. We're moving the authority for addressing sexual assault claims to a specialized independent military unit outside the chain of command. That was a long time in coming. But it's a big deal.
And we all owe a thanks to Senator Gillibrand in New York for her leadership in this because she did not give up until she got it done.
And there is more to do. But we've made a lot of progress. And we've got to keep going.
Let me close to this. After I signed the PACT Act into law last August, I handed the penthere is a tradition when you sign a piece of legislation, particularly a significant piece, you have the people who are responsible for getting it done for you on the stage with you when you sign it. And you traditionally give the pen to the most consequential person who helped that happen.
We got finished, and I signedthe pen to the widow and daughter of Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson, a veteran for whom the bill was named. His widow was also my wife's guest at the State of the Union. A family that suffered the greatest of losses, but turned their pain into purpose.
And I handed the pen not to the mother, but to Sergeant Robinson's little girl. A lovely little kid sitting next to me. And she looked at me, and she said: ""Thank you for my daddy."" ""Thank you for my daddy."" I think she was talking for all of us, everyone who fought so hard and came together to keep our promise to the veterans and to keep faith with our heroes. That's courage. That's character.
That's who all of you are. Not hyperbole. I want to thank you allDemocrat, Republican, Independentsfor your work to get this bill to my desk and to get it signed.
As I said, I was going to sign that bill come hell or high water, no matter how long I had to keep the Congress in.
It's just another reminder of what we know to be true: We are the United States of America. There's nothingnothingbeyond our capacity when we decide to work together to get it done. We never fail when we do that. Never on any major issue.
So God bless you all. And let's continue to work together. And God save our veterans.
Thank you.

You know, I got so tired, over the last 15 yearsand this is a little story I want to tell you about why I'm soI was telling the team here: I've never beenI've been aI know I don't look it, but I've been around a long time. [Laughter] But I've never been more optimistic in my whole career than I am today about America's prospects in both foreign and domestic policy.
You know, went through an awful long time watching companies, in the last 15 years, decide to invest overseas because the labor was cheaper, shutting down factories all across Americaall across America.
And I asked myself: Why do we have to put up with that? We're sending jobs abroad and importing products at home. We knew we could change it. I just knew we could change that. We have the best workers in the world.
And my team[applause]no, and my team and I decidedyou know, if you'll hold herethere's a law that was passed in the thirties. It says any money that Congress sends me toto spend, I can insist that it all be spent on American products with American workers. No President has paid much attention to that in anyin either party. But guess what? I'm paying attention.
As a simple propositionI mean this sincerely, from the bottom of my heartwe decided we're going to invest in America. And this company is a great example.
They're now poised to be the leader in the wind industry. But a few years ago, they were laying off workers because we weren't investing in them. So we passed a significant climate legislation not only that moves us away from fossil fuels to acleaner technologies like wind, but it means we're going to make things and new technology here in America.
And there's no reason[applause]. There's no reason why we can't do it. We have the best educatedwe have the most advanced technology in the world. Why are we not doing that? That's basically what we're talking about today when we talk about investing in America.
So today I want to talk about theour progress in growing the economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down.
I came to office determined to move away from trickle-down economicsInot a whole lot trickled down on my dad's kitchen table when we were growing upand focus instead on the middle class, because the middle class built America. And guess what? Guess what? And unions built the middle class. That's not hyperbole. That's a fact.
And, folksand when the middle classI'm a capitalist. When the middle class does well, everybody does well. The poor have a way up, and the rich were able to be very rich. Just make sure they pay a little more of their taxes.
Audience members. Yes!
The President. But look, the Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal have started to callhave started to call my plan ""Bidenomics."" Initially, I don't think they meant it with a great deal of respect. [Laughter] With all due respect for them, our plan is working. It's working.
The economy has grown since I took office. It grew faster in the last quarter than anyone expected. And you know, we created over 13 million brandnew jobs since I took office13 million in less than 3 years. Ninety thousand new jobs right here in New Mexico. Eight hundred thousand manufacturing jobs nationwide800,000.
And I know that you're tired of hearing me say this, but where is it written that America can't lead the world again in manufacturing? Because we're going to do just that: the leading manufacturer in the world.
It's not like this isthese are facts. It's not hyperbole. We've created more jobs in 2 years than any President in American history has in a 4-year term.
Unemployment has been below 4 percent for the longest period stretch in 50 years of American history. And not only have we recovered all the jobs we lost during the pandemic, we now have more jobs than we did before the pandemic.
Because unemployment's been so low for so long, workers aren't just finding more jobs. They're able to look for better jobs at higher pay. And according to the research surveys, job satisfaction in America is higher than it's been in the last 36 years. Look, the share of workingthe share of working-age Americans with jobs is as high as it's been in 20 years. That's never happened under my predecessor.
So where are we now? Well, unemployment is down, and so is inflation. Remember all the experts, including some that worked for me, told us that to get inflation under control we needed to lower wages and reduce the number of people working. No, I'mthatthat's been sort of gospel. [Laughter] Not a joke. Seriously. Some of you here in the audience are economists. You know that.
But I never bought itthe problem was, too many people are working or working people are workingmaking too much money. That's not the problem.
There is a lot of reasons for inflation is up. First, the pandemic. Second, the war in Ukraine. Third, broken supply chains.
Now, one reason we've seen inflation fall by two-thirds without losing jobs is, we're seeing corporate profits come back down to earth.
We have more to do, but inflation is now at its lowest point in 2 years. In fact, we have the lowest rate of inflation among the world's major economies. No other economymajor economy in the world isinflation as low as we are. It's down from 9 percent to 3 percent.
There is a lot more work to do. I'm not satisfied with where it is. More work aheadthe Washington Post recently suggested in anfront-page articleI think it was front pagethat, quote, ""Republicans may have to find something else to criticize Biden for now that inflation is coming down."" [Laughter] I'm sure they'll find something. [Laughter]
At the same time, pay for low-wage workers has grown at the fastest pace in over two decades, and wages are growing faster than inflation. And we're continuing to make progress in fixing the supply chains.
For example, we couldn't access semiconductors during the pandemic because the factories making them overseas were shut down. We all know semiconductors are those little small computer chips about the size of the end of your fingertip that affect nearly everything in our lives, from cell phones to automobiles, refrigerators, to the most sophisticated weapons system, including the systems that Los Alamos and Sandia National Laboratories provide for our national security.
America invented these chips. We invented them when we went to the Moon. We made them work better. We made them more sophisticated. But over time, we went from producing nearly 40 percent of those chipsthe world's chipsdown to 10 percent. That's why I designated and I signedand I insisted that it be written and passedthe CHIPS and Science Act exactly almost 1 year ago today. Very short[applause].
Now, all over the country, semiconductor companies are investing in a record billions of dollars. By the way, do you know how much has been committed in the CHIPS and Science Act to be invested in America? Two hundred and thirty billion dollars. Two hundred and thirty billion dollars to bring chip productionto bring chip productionback home in Ohio, New York, Arizona, and right here in New Mexico.
Look, just a few years ago, Intel cut 700 jobs at its semiconductor fab in Rio Rancho. Now they're expanding their fab with a $3.5 billion investment, creating 700 new jobs, many of which won't require a college degree.
And by the way, that's over $200 billion. They're building fabs. They're just called factories. They're the size of a football field, not much wider than this. And guess what? Average salary is about 130,000 grand. And guess what? You don't need a college degree. Make over $100,000it's about time. And, folks, unions are building the structures as well.
Look, folks, that's Bidenomics.
Since I took office, we have attracted over a half a trillion dollarshalf a trillion dollarsin private investment in manufacturing and industries of the future right here in America.
According to Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs and Wall Street, my ""Invest in America"" agenda is leading to a boom in manufacturing investment. Spending on construction for manufacturing plants nearly doubled in the last 2 years after growing only 2 percent the previous 4 years.
Last quarter, factory construction contributed more to the gross domestic product than any time in 40 years40 years. Instead of exporting American jobs, we're creating American jobs, and we're exporting American products. And we're seeing it right here in America. We're seeing it in New Mexico as well.
In 2008, Solo cup factory shut down right here, right where we're standing. Two hundred people lost their jobs. Nearly a decade and a half later, a plastics company bought the site. It shut down after 3 years, laying off a hundred workers. It's been idle ever since.
Now, it's coming alive again. Arcosa makes wind turbineswind towers. Thosethat's the thing that holdsmostwhen I say that, people think at me like wind toweryou all know what a wind tower is. They look at my like, ""What the hell is a wind tower?"" [Laughter]
That's a key component. You know, you have to have it to hold up thoseyou know how longby the way, I was in Eastern Colorado looking at the blades manufacturer. Those blades are a hundred and three yards long, longer than a football field. And by the way, they don't cause cancer. [Laughter]
And by the way, wind energy is cheaper than fossil fuel. Solar energy is cheaper.
A few years ago, business took a turn, and they were forced to lay off 200 employees at plants all across America. Now, thanks to the new law I signed making historic investments in clean energy, business is booming again.
By the way, thatthey call it the Inflation Reduction Act, but within that is the act relating to the climate, and it's $368 billion. And when I passed that, not one single guy on the other team voted for it. Nobody voted for it on the other team.
Since I signed that lawbill into law, Arcosa has received $1.1 billion in orders for new wind towers. And today we're here breaking ground on a new plant that's going to create 250 new good-paying jobs.
And meanwhile, we're speeding up permitting for transmission lines so wind energy produced by these towers reaches people's homes. Because what's happening now is, it's hard to get at thesea lot of these towers are old. And everybody is: ""Not in my neighborhood."" They don't want a big new tower going up.
So we're strengthening the towers, and we're going to go underground. It costs six times as much to go underground, but we're learning how to do that more cheaply so it doesn't cause the forest fires and all the things that happen when major wind storms knock these lines down.
My administration recently completed a review of a proposed SunZia line to transportation energy from a planneda planned wind farm here in New Mexico and Arizona and California. So you're going to generate the wind hereI mean, the energy hereand be able to transmit it all the way across Arizona and into California as well.
These projects are expected to create 2,000 new construction jobs and up to 150 permanent jobs, providing clean energy for up to 3 million Americans3 million[applause]and reducing the pressures of climate change.
Like I said, Bidenomics is about bringing supply chains back home.
Arcosa makes wind towers that's going to go into turbines made by GE Veronaexcuse me, I mispronounced it: Vernovain Florida and New York. Pattern Energy will use these turbines to build the largest wind farms in the Western Hemisphere, spanning Lincoln, Torrance, and San Miguel Counties in New Mexico. And SunZia will use that energy to power homes all across the Southwest.
That's Bidenomics. It's cheaper. It's cheaper. That's what we're talking about: investing in America.
You know, this company says the investing they're making here is a direct result of the law we signed almost exactly a year ago, the most significant investment in clean energy and combating the existential threat of climate change ever, anywhere in the world. Like I said, it's $368 billion.
And Governor Lujan Grisham is leading the way, launching New Mexico's community solar program so families will save money on electric bills; stopping leaks of superpolluting methane from oil and gas operationswe're capping thousands of those wells all across America, beginning in EasternWestern Pennsylvania and coming eastcoming west; and putting New Mexico on a path for a cleaner, cheaper electric transmission future as well in this State.
Folks, when I think jobswhen I think climate, I think jobs. I don't think all the dangersthere's real danger, but the jobs to fix the problemmy mother used to have an expression. After I lost my wife and daughter, she was trying to console me. She said, ""Joey, out of anything bad, something good will happen if you look hard enough for it."" Well, all across America, we're looking. There are going to bea lot of good things are going to happen as a consequence of this problem we're facing.
What Arcosa is doing here is part of a much broader clean energy manufacturing. It's going to happen in big cities and rural communities as well. Like in Colorado, where CS Wind broke ground on what will be the world's largest wind tower manufacturing plant.
And, coincidentally, CS Wind is Congresswoman Lauren Boebertyou know that very quiet Republican lady? [Laughter] It's in her district. Who, along with every other Republican, voted against this bill. And it's making all this possible. And she railed against its passage. But that's okay, she's welcoming it now.
When I ran for office, I promised to be President for all Americans. Whether you live in a blue State or a red State, I'm going to keep my promise.
Before we made these historic clean energy investments, Siemens Corporation laid off workers who were making wind turbine parts and put the plant in Iowa and Kansas into what they now callthey refer to as ""hibernation."" I hibernated in a whileayou know, Iowa for a while. But look, now they're reopening both these plants and rehiring workers.
In New York, GE is investing $50 million for a new manufacturing assembly line making critical components for turbines in partnership with organized labor.
Every one of these companies has pointed to the clean energy law that we originated and I signed as a reason for making these investments. And we're making sure rural communities are benefiting from these historic investments as well. It's not just urban areas.
We're investing over $160 million in New Mexico to support conservation and climate-smart agriculture and forestry, like improved water management or grazing livestock in ways that improve soil health, helping farmers and ranchers get paid for doing the right thing, planting material that absorbs carbon from the air and not justlook, we've launched the Rural Partners Network, placing Federal employees on the ground in New Mexico to help rural communities take advantage of the Federal resources. So they're there and canbecause this is all new stuff. People on the ground to say: ""Here's how you do it. This is what you do.""
Building an economy from the bottom up and the middle out means strengthening our rural economy so farmers and ranchers and their children don't have to leave home to find opportunities for work.
Where I come from, it's all about pride. It's all about restoring pride, being able to make a living in the community you love and where you were raised and not have to leave.
Folks, this is all part of my plan. The plan is to invest in America. We're transforming our country, including by rebuilding America's infrastructure.
We used to have the best infrastructure in the world. We were number one in the world. That's ports, railroads, airports, roads, everything. You know what we are now? We're number 13 in the world. China used to be number eight. Now they're number two.
How can you have the best economy in the world with a second-rate infrastructure? It's not possible.
And through the bipartisan infrastructure law, we already announced over 37,000 projects in 4,500 communities all across America, including $3.6 billion in investments right here in New Mexico. So far. We're just getting started.
For example, the city of Albuquerque is getting $25 million to rebuild the Uptown Transit Center, making it safer, more accessible, and easier for folks to get uptown and helping transform the area into a vibrant community hub.
We're investing $160 million in Eastern New Mexico Rural Water System to build a new transmission pipeline, providing a critical water supply to nearly 70,000 people, from Clovis to Portales to Cannonto, excuse me, Cannon Air Force Base.
Look, right now over 114,000 homes and small businesses across New Mexico don't have access to high-speed internet. We're investing over $1 billion in this State to connect every corner of this State, especially rural communities and family farms, with affordable internet.
So people sometimes say, ""Why are you doing that?"" Imagine if a long timeRoosevelt and the telephones came along and said, ""We're not going to help invest in telephones."" Come on, man. [Laughter] I don't know what the hell we're thinking.
Already, we're saving nearly 170,000 New Mexico families $30 a month on their internet bills so far. We're making investments like this all across the country.
I'll justif I could pause for another second. There is a distinguished Senator from the State of Alabama who used to be a pretty good football coach, and he's railed against this legislation. And then I noticed he had a big announcement: ""Alabama is going to get a billion two hundred million dollars for internet."" And I thought: ""Wait a minute. Didn't he rail against that for a long, long time?"" I was inclined to go down and help him celebrate, but I decided not to. [Laughter]
Look, we can see exactly where we're making these investments, and you can see exactly where they are if you go to invest.gov. You'll know exactly where every one of these investments is going throughout America.
These investments create thousands of good-paying jobs. And we're making sure workers have the skills to do the jobs. For example, in New Mexico, we're funding the mobile training unit run by the plumbers and pipefitters union, UA Local 412. It's going to train plumbers and pipefitters and HVAC workers with a focus on training Latino workers, Indigenous people, and people recovering from substance abuse.
And I know you're probably thinking what a lot of our very conservative Republican friends: ""Biden is spending all this money, man. My taxes are going to go up."" Unless you make more than $400,000 a year, your Federal taxes aren't going to go up a single penny.
And guess what? I did all this without raising anybody's taxes in the middle class. And one other little thing: During this process, I cut the Federal budget in 2 years by $1.7 trillion. One-point-seventhe largest anyone has ever done in 2 years. The last guy increased the national debt by 40 percent.
Folks, we've done all this without raising taxes on the middle class, and I promise we'll never raise Federal tax on anyone making less than $400,000 a year. I've kept that promise, and I'm going to keep it, unlike myunlike the last President.
And as I said, my first 2 years in office, the Federal deficit fell by $1.7 trillion.
Audience member. Thank you, Joe!
The President. And we got what we promised. We can cut the Federal deficit and still do all the rest of this.
Folks, every one of my friends on the other team in Congress voted against the clean energy investments. And the vast majority voted against the bipartisan infrastructure law. But that hasn't stopped them from claiming credit now that billions of dollars and thousands of jobs are coming into their States.
Like I said at the State of the Union Address, I'll see them at the groundbreakings. [Laughter]
Look, let me close with this. I'm not here to declare victory on the economy. We have a lot more work to do, but we have a plan, and it's turning things around. Bidenomics is just another way of saying: restore the American Dream.
Forty years of trickle-down economic policy limited the dream to those at the top. But I believe every American willing to work hard should be able to get a job no matter where they livein the heartland, small townsto raise their kids on a good paycheck and be able to keep their roots where they grew up.
My dad used to have a saying, and I mean this sincerelyhe'd say: ""Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your pride; it's about dignity."" And he meant it. Not a joke. It's about dignity. It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, ""Honey, it's going to be okay."" It's the being able to sayyou think I'm kidding, but Isome of yousome of the folks in Congress knew my dad. He meant it.
And he said: ""The real question, Joey, is, at the end of the month, is thereafter you pay all your bills, is there anyanything left? Do you have a little breathing roomjust a little bit of breathing room?""
Well, folks, that's part of the American Dream. And that's Bidenomics. It's rooted in what has always worked best in this country: investing in America, invest in Americans. Because when we invest in our people, when we strengthen the middle class, we have stronger economic growth that benefits everybodythe poor, the wealthy, everybody.
And for the longest time, we've been told to give up on American manufacturing, that it can't happen again, and we just can't do it anymore. Well, as you might have noticed, I've never believed that. As I said, America used to lead the world in manufacturing, and we're going to do it again.
I can honestly say I've never been more optimistic about America's future. Just remember who we are: We are the United States of America. And there is nothingnothing beyondI mean it sincerely. Think of any objective we've set as a goal that we've ever not met. Name one. No matter what it is, we've never, never, neverwhen we've worked togetherfailed. Nothing is beyond our capacity if we work together.
And God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you so much.

2023-08-08 00:00:00,"Remarks at a Campaign Reception in Albuquerque, New Mexico","
The President. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Well, Randi, you know, it's a good thing you're not doing this overseas. Every time I go overseas, you know how many people have to travel with me? [Laughter] Nine hundred.
Audience members. Whoa!
The President. Andbut like you said, you and my wife agree: They're too damn nice lookingmost of them. That's what worries me. [Laughter]
But all kidding aside, thank you very much. Look, it's one thing to come to a fundraiser, which I truly appreciateto do a fundraiser. It's another thing to have one in your home, and it takes over everything. So thank you, thank you, thank you.
And, you know, the Governor has been a good friend since I got engaged in running. And she's done a hell of a job in the House, and she's done a hell of a job here as Governor. And we come from the same value set.
You know, I said I was running the first time for three reasons, even as my campaign staff thought it wasI was off base. The first one, I said I want to restore the soul of America, this sense of decency we used to have when Fred and I worked together. Fred, we used to argue like hellnot Fred and I.
And, by the way, I want to personally thank Fred Harris, because when I got elected[applause]thank youwhen I got elected as a kid in 1972, I thought the world had come to me. And I was down in Washington borrowing Teddy Kennedy's office, hiring staff. I wasn't old enough to be sworn in yet. You had to be 30 to be sworn in, and I was waiting to be constitutionally eligible. And I got a phone call saying my wife and daughter had just been killed, and my two boys weren't likely to make it.
And there were people who came to me, who surrounded meand I mean this sincerelythat gave me reason to stay. They saved my sanity. And that's not hyperbole.
A lot of you've been through as much or worse than I've been through. And I'm notI'm not talking about the death of it. But what peopleI didn't want to stay. I had called my sister, who managed my campaign, and my brother and said, ""We elected a Democratic Governor."" Remember, Fred? And we hadalready had 58 Democratic Senators. They didn'tit wasn't like they weren't going to have another Democrat replace me.
But a group of Senators, including Fred and about five others, just always were coming byjust come by the office, ""Why don't you just come to lunch with us?"" ""Why don't you""I wanted no part of it. I wanted to get in and out.
So, Fred, you are not only one of the toughest and smartest Senators I ever worked with, but you have a heart as big as your head, pal. Thank you. Thank you.
And speaking of big, you got yourself a Senator who looks like he could play tight end somewhere around here sitting down at the other end. Just don't jump in the pool right away. Okay? Hang on.
And, look, there's so many people here to thank. If I do that, I'll do the whole night. But I'm going to take a few more minutes to thank just a few more people.
You know, folks, one of the things thatwhen I said there isthe reasons that I ran, when I announced my running for the Presidency, is that I had no intention of running for President again. My son hadmy son Beau had just died because of Iraq. I didn't want any part of getting engaged. I was out of office. I was a full professor at the University of Pennsylvania. They gave me a $2 million staff. I had staff like Tony Blinken doing foreign policy with me and others. And I didn't want to run.
Andbut then remember what happened in Charlottesville? When those folks came out of the woods carrying torches, Nazi banners, singing the same anti-Semitic bile they sang in '33 and '34 in Germany, and accompanied by the Ku Klux Klan. And a young woman, whose mother I met, was killedwho was standing by and was killed.
And they asked the sitting President what he thought, and he said there was good people on both sides. That's when I decidedand many of you did, toothat you hadwe had to be engaged. This is a different deal. This is a different deal.
This is not about this upcoming election. This is about the past.
And so, we found ourselvesI concluded when I ranone of the things Fred and I agreed on when we were in the Senate was that, you know, trickle-down economics never worked much for my dad. My dad was a gentleman. His greatest regret he washe never he was extremely well read. And he had gonebeen accepted to John Hopkins. Couldn't do it. Anyway. To make a long story short, his greatest regret: He never went to college.
But my dad was one of those guys who worked like hell, never complained, and would always come home for dinner and then go back to work. But my dad was one of those guys whonothing much trickled down on his kitchen table. And he used to say: ""Joey""for real""a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about being able to look you kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay.'"" Not asking much. Just being aa clear shot.
And so the second reason I ran was to begin to rebuild this country and rebuild the middle class. Because when the middle class does well, the poor have a way up and the wealthy continue to do very well.
I'm a capitalist. If you can make a billion dollars, make it. If you can make a million dollars, make it. Just pay your taxes. Just pay your taxes.
And so the third reasonand you may remember I got roundly criticized for saying itwas I said, ""I want to unite the country."" For how can a participatory democracy function without unity, without being able to get along with one another? And the pressand the press is here tonight. The press legitimately was saying: Biden had that reputation when he was a Senator; he was able to bring people together.
And Iwe served with guys like Jesse Helms and Strom Thurmond and Jim Eastland. By the way, Jim Eastland once said to mewe were walking back from the Judiciary Committee one day. We were taking pictures a moment agoall of us. And I came around the corner and there was a group ofwell, I was walking with him back to his office from the Judiciary Committee meeting.
And all of a sudden, we turned the corner and there are about 10 people from Mississippi. And they don't ask to have their picture ""taken""; they want their picture ""made."" They said, ""Mr. Chairman! Mr. Chairman! Can I have my picture made with[inaudible]?"" Next thing you know, I'm in the picture.
And I went into his office with him. And he said, ""Joe, you all know those folks in Mississippi?"" And I said: ""No, I didn't. I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman. I didn't mean to be in the picture."" He said, ""Whenever you have your picture made with folks you don't know, always stand on the end."" He said, ""No body parts touching."" [Laughter] He said, ""Because that way, if they turn out bad, you can cut yourself out."" [Laughter]
Well, a lot of people are getting cut out these days. And it's a different place. Fred, I don't think you'd recognize it. It's a different place. Your two Senators here can tell you that.
And so one of the things that we are trying to do is, I decided that we were just going to go ahead and try to keep the commitments that I made.
And, you know Ben Ray has been a partner of mine for a long time. I don't know how we could get much we got done without Ben.
And your new Representative. She's doing one hell of a job. She's doing one hell of a job.
And Mayor Tim Keller and other elected officials here. Tim is going to be[applause]you're announcingI won'tI'm not going to jump but when are you going to make that announcement you talked to me about today? Is it Friday or
Mayor Timothy M. Keller of Albuquerque, NM. Friday.
The President. Friday. More good news coming, I believe.
And by the way, you know, I just came from your neighboring State of Arizona. And you're right, they do claim to have the largest Native American population. But I met with 15 Tribal leaders. And I had the opportunity to do something I wanted to do. I was able to dedicate 1 million acres of Tribal land back to the surrounding[applause]surrounding the Grand Canyon.
But look, folks, let me I'm going on too long here. Let me talk about whatyou know, a lot of you are the reason I got elected in the first place. That's not hyperbole. And I appreciate you taking a shot with me again.
I've never beenI've beenI know I'm only 35 years old. I know that. [Laughter] But I've never been more optimistic about America's chances than I am today. I mean that sincerely. Because we are, I truly believeand when I was deciding whether or not to run the last time, I started to write a book about the inflection points in history, where every couple of generations, things change in such a profound way that they're never going to go back to being the same. It could be better or worse, but they're fundamental changes.
And that's what's going on now. There's fundamental changes happening, whether it's global warming or the tundra melting andwhatever it is, there's just fundamental change taking place. And we have a chance to move it in the right directions if we're smart about it.
And so far, there's two things that we have to do. Take a look what's happening around the world. We found ourselves in a circumstance where wePutin isand it's starting to rain, so I'm going to make this real quick. [Laughter]
The bottom line is: The allegiances are changing around the world in a big way. And they're changing in terms of, for example, the idea that there was going to be a response to Putin's aggression in Ukraine was not likely. I've spent over 200 hours with the heads of state in the European countries, just holding it togetherI mean it sincerelykeeping all of NATO and the European Union solidly together so there was no cracks. Because Putin is convinced that if, in fact, he can break NATO, he breaks through, it changes the whole dynamic.
We're in a situation where we fundamentally changed that dynamic in Southeast Asia as well as in the Indian Ocean and theand that whole area. Because what we have now is, we put together a thing called the Quad. We havedid you ever think you'd have Japan, India, the United States, and Australia working as closely as we are?
Well, guess who wantsI'm going to be going to Vietnam shortly because Vietnam wants to change our relationship and become a partner.
We find ourselves in a situation where all of these changes around the world are taking place at a time we have an opportunity, if we're smart, to change the dynamic.
For example, I'm holding an event at Camp David with South Korea and Japan, together. They've had a rapprochement. So my point is: There's a lotthe countrythe world is ready. They're hungry. They know there's a need, and they're looking for leadership.
And one of the things that I'm convinced is trueour former Secretary of State used to say America is the essential nation. We are the essential nation. Not Joe Biden. When I walk into a room, everything changesnot because of Joe Biden, because I'm President of the United States of America. Not a joke.
And so[applause]we have an enormous opportunityenormous opportunityto change the dynamics in the world, if we're lucky and if we work like hell at it.
On the domestic side, you know, II'm going to make this even shorter. We've done, I think, pretty darn well. You know, my dad, as I said, used to say: ""A job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about pride.""
Well, when we decided to begin to build from the middle out and the bottom up, things began to change.
A few little statistics, which are thatand there's three kinds of lies, as Disraeli said, ""lies, damned lies, and statistics."" But, you know, thethe Economist and the Wall Street Journal, early on, started making fun of Bidenomics. Well, now they're[inaudible]praising Bidenomics. They don't know quite what to do with it.
By that, I mean we're building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up. We're establishing our leadership in the world. We're in a position wherethis Bidenomicswe've created 13 million jobs in 2 years. That's more than ever has occurred.
We created nearly 800,000 manufacturing jobs800,000. Unemployment rate is 3.5 percent. It's below that for the longest period in American history.
We're in a situation where inflation is the lowest in 2 yearsat 3 percentwhen it was 9 percent when we took over.
The point I'm making is that things are beginning to move. But one of the things we did was the American Rescue Plan. Well, you're right about what your Governor did, in terms of saving lives with COVID. We were able to reach out. And when we took office, there were only about 200,000 people who had been vaccinated. We changed that. We changed the entire nation.
Bipartisan infrastructure law: 37,000 projects already approved. And remember with Trump, it was going to bethere's going to be ""Infrastructure Month."" Well, it went on for 4 years. Now we have ""Infrastructure Decade,"" and we're putting a whole hell of a lot of union workers to work with good jobs.
And by the way, I met with the Business Roundtable. They said, ""Why are they calling you the most pro-union President in American history?"" I said, ""Because[inaudible]."" They said, ""Well, why are you?"" I said, ""Because you need them.""
Andbecause, you know, everybody thinks you become an electrician, you just show up and say, ""I want to be an electrician""if you've worked for 4 years as an apprentice to get there.
And so, things are changing. Attitudes are changing between corporate America and labor. Attitudes are changing across the board.
We also decided that myone of my passions since I've been insince the eighties was the environment. Well, we've put ourselves in a position where we passed the most comprehensive environmental piece ofit's called the ""Inflation Reduction Act."" It's within that. It has nothing to do with inflation; it has to do with the[inaudible]$4- $600excuse me, $368 billion, the single largest investment in climate change anywhere in the worldanywhereno one has ever, ever spent that. And it's beginning to take hold.
I hadI met in the back lawn of the White Housethe South Lawnwith all the automobile manufacturers. Guess what? At the time, remember, General Motors was suing California for having a higher standard on pollution, exhaust from tailpipes, than the Federal standard. And they said they couldn't do that.
Well, we had a talk with Mary Barra and others, the chairman of the company, and they changed their mind. They all came to me and said, ""We're going to go totally electric by 2035 and 50-percent electric by '33. That's going to change[applause]billionsI mean billions of tons of CO2.
We're in a position where we're changing the nature and way in which we deal with so many other things relating to the environment.
And I just came, as I said, from your neighboring State. There's a lot going on there and all around the world. We're making significant progress.
We're in a situation where we've employed more people than any other nation in the world. We're making other nationsand, by the way, all thisand I'm doing this quicklyand I apologize because I think you're going to get wet.
Butwell, here's the deal: You know, they said, ""Well, Biden is a big spender; things are going ongoing to be going back""guess what? When Trump left office, he increased the Federal deficit 235 years by 40 percent. My first 2 years, I've reduced the deficit by 1 trillion 700 billion dollars[inaudible].
And I made a commitment: No one making less than $400,000 are going to see a penny in Federal taxes going up as long as I'm President of the United States.
But the flip of this isalso[inaudible], weyou know, we used to have in Americabefore the pandemic started, we had 749 billionaires. We now have a thousand. You know what the average rate of Federal tax they pay: 8.3 percent. That ain't fair. That ain't fair. I don't want them paying 80 percent. I don't even wantjust want them paying the top rate. That's it. It's in the thirties, not thenot the eighties.
And we fundamentally can change the way things wasthings work. And I think you're even seeing the business community
By the way, I know a few things about corporate America. I come from a corporate State of the world. Delaware has more corporations incorporated in the State of Delaware than every other State in the Union combinedcombinedevery single solitary one.
So my point is: There's so many opportunities, and people are open to the change. They're open to change. And so what we have to do is just keep our head down and keep moving, in my view.
And one of the things we've donefor example, weI decided tothatyou know, there's a provision in a 1934 law saying that any Federal funds spent by the President of the United States should be made in America andwell as by American personnel. Well, guess what? No President, Democrat or Republican, paid much attention to it. Well, I have.
Well, guess what? That's the reason why we have so much employment going on. We'rewe're bringingfor example, we invented the computer chipit was about the size of the little tip of my finger. And guess what? We used to have 40 percent of the market. We invented it; we made itwe made it work.
Well, guess what? We now have convinced over $450 billion in outside investment building these fabsthese great, big things that are the size of football fields that build these computer chips.
Guess what? The average salary in those fabs is 115,000 bucks. And guess what? You don't need a college degree to be there. You don't need a college degree.
So the other thing we're doing: We're trying to restore pride to the[inaudible]. Those of you who come from places that areI'm going to stop. You guys are going to get soaking wet. [Laughter]
Look, I think that we have to understand that people have aI was born and raised and my family is from Scranton, Pennsylvania. When coal died, everything died, including the pride of the citythe pride of the city. Everybody is from Scranton; no one is in Scranton.
And so, what's happening is all these factories we're going to be building and more construction than any time in modern American history. We're bringing back pride toand I made a commitment: I represent red States the same way I represent blue States and make no distinction.
And guess what? That factory that your father and your grandfather worked at that employed 2,000 people in townin a small town in the Midwestthat gave people pride, whenwhen it shut down, everything shut down. Everything shut down.
How many of you know friends from the Midwest who gotwhotheir parents were told: ""Mom, Dad, I can't stay. There's no jobs. I've got to leave."" You should be able to stay and work where you live.
And so we'rethere are all these factories that are opening up across the country. And they're investing billions of dollars in these factories. Up in Rochester, New Yorkanyway, it's a significant changesignificant change that's underway, if we're conscious of what we're doing and if we're completely, thoroughly honest with the American public about what's going on.
And so, folks, I'm trying to think how to get to the end here real quickly. [Laughter]
Thelook, you know, there's two ways to deal with inflation: try to bring it down by the traditional way and what the Fed is doing and what we're doing, et cetera. But, also, there's another way. It'smy dad used to say: ""How much money do you have after you got your monthly paychecks and you've paid all your bills? Do you have any breathing room left? Is there anything left?""
One of the ways to reduce inflation isanybody you knowI'm not asking you to say yourself, but anybody know anybody with type 1 or type 2 diabetes? You need insulin. Well, guess what? It's between $4- and $800 a month, depending on what you need.
I was in Southern VirginiaI was in Northern Virginia at a town meeting, and a woman stood up. Sheand she said: ""I'm a middle-class person. We have insurance but don't have enough insurance to cover my two daughters. Both of them need insulin. And what we do is we cut it in half."" Wewell, guess what? You know how much it costs for the drug companies to make that insulin? Ten dollars and twenty cents. To package it: total $13. Charging $4- to $800 makes no sense. And guess what? It'sit's American taxpayers paying for it because the Medicare is paying for this.
So I didgot itwe got a little negotiation. If you areand God forbid, I hope you don't need itbut if you need insulin, you're paying now fifty $35 a month to make you[applause]becauseand, by the way, it's saving the taxpayers billions of dollarsbillions of dollars.
And so, for example, beginning in 2024, no matter how manyno matter what your bills are, if you hadand some of theand some of you, like me, understand thethe ravages of cancer and the cost of the drugs. I don't have cancer, but family members.
And guess what? You know, some of these drugs cost anywhere from $8- to $9,000 a year. Well, beginning in 2024, your total drug cost, if you're on Medicare, will not exceed $2,000, no matter what it is.
And so there is a lot of things we can do to restore some pride and dignity to people. It's all about dignity. It's all about being able to look your kid in the eye. It's all about being able to just hold your head high and say: ""You know, II'm doing my best. I have a shot."" And just giving people a shot.
And it's nothing really radical, but it's working. And I think it's going to continue to work.
Folks, you know, we're in a situation where we are now down tolet me conclude by saying it's basically resilience.
You know, when we talk about the environment, we're talking about the things that can fundamentally change how we live. Fundamentally changeone of the hardest things to get through is we're going to spend over 1 trillion 300 billion dollars on the infrastructure over the next 10 years. And we're going to spend a significant amount of moneyalmost $368 billion on the environment and still be able to pay for it.
But here is the deal: In the process of doing that, we've got to be in a position to be able to show people what we've done. And so, although personal ratings are high, when the economywe're runningthe idea we're running in the midforties doesn't seem too consistent.
The more you readI'm going say something self-serving sounding, at least. Most Presidential historians are giving me enormous credit for saying I've got more done in 2 years than any President since Roosevelt. But it doesn'tno, no, no. It doesn't show. It takes time for people to realize why that's there.
In communities, for exampleI'll end with this. Philadelphia, there was aon the beltway going through Philadelphia, there was aon 95 north and south, 40140,000 cars traveled over this one small bridge in Philadelphia and 40,000 trucks. Well, a guy going underneath the bridge knocked down the pillars, the bridge fell down, everything stopped.
It would have ordinarily taken somewhere between 6 and 9 months. I got it done in 5 daysf-i-v-e days. Because we can. We had the capacity to do it. Not just[inaudible]we had the capacity and the will to do it. Labor was all in. Everyone was working together.
But in addition to that, we found ourselves in a situation where the Roosevelt Expressway had to be changed. A hundred and nine people dead because of thehow dangerous that expressway is in the curves. Well, we're going to change it.
And people are starting to say in the Philadelphia market, ""God, Biden did thisBiden's proposal did this?""
Well, they're beginning to realize what we've actually passed is having an impact. And so it's going to take a little while, but I don't care whether it does or not as long as it gets doneas long as it gets done.
We have a lot we can do. We're going to get it done. And asyou know, as myevery time I'd walked out of my Grandfather Finnegan's house, my grandpop up in Scranton was ahe was first-generation Irish American. And hewell, let me put it this way: Irish Catholics weren't at the top of the list in Northeast Pennsylvania in the mines.
Matter of fact, one of the great disappointments was we had an uncle who wasturns out to be mining engineer and four of them worked earlier in the mines. And one was accused when he ranmy great-great-grandfather was only the second Irish Catholic ever elected in the State of Pennsylvania to the State Senate. Andand when he passed awaywhen he was running, they were accusing him of having been a Molly Maguire.
Do you know what a Molly McGuire was? Molly McGuire was one of those folks who when thewerewhen the Irish were so badly mistreated in the mines, they had a group of thesebasically Irish thugs called Molly Maguires. What they would do is they'd find the people abusing the workers, kill them, and drop them on their doorstep.
Well, the whole family was so disappointed to find out he wasn't a Molly Maguire. [Laughter]
But all kidding aside, things are changingchange rapidly. And as things fell apart, people still stuck together. But there's much more we have to do.
But every time I'd walk out of my grandpop's house, he'd look at me and he'd yell, ""Joey""myand heby the way, he went to Santa Clara out hereout of California, was an All-American football player in 1906, went back, was a newspaper guy in the business side, had four sons and a daughtermy mom.
Andbut every time he'd walk out the door, he'd yell, ""Joey, keep the faith."" And my grandmother would go: ""No, Joey. Spread it.""
Let's go spread the faith. Thank you.

2023-06-19 00:00:00,"Remarks on Efforts To Combat Climate Change in Palo Alto, California","
Well, thank you, Chiena, for that introduction.
Governor Newsom, I tell you what, it's nice to be here, as you said, working on something that's a positive thing going forward and not fixing something that happened veryvery badly. We've spent a lot of time in helicopters flying over areas that needed helped.
Folks, I want to thankAnna, thank you, kid. [Laughter] You've been incredible. You've been a friend for a long, long time in the Congress, when I was in the Senate. And you've done remarkable work. You've partnered on everything from protecting the environment to providingimproving the lives of the people in this district.
And thanks to all the climate leaders that are here today.
You know, we just visited the salt marsh, as you saw. We walked down to the end of the Safety Bay ProjectSafer Bay Project, anda public-private partnership that's harnessing the nature of our ability to do what this young woman, Chiena, did.
You know, one of theI always sayI neverand I mean it sincerely: I've been around a long time in public life. I got elected when I was about your age, when I was 28 years old. And you know what? I've never been more optimistic. I'veyou and I were talking about the privately. I swear to God, I've never been more optimistic in my life.
And the reason I'm optimistic is because of this generation. It's the best educated, the most engaged, the most involved, and the most consequential. They're inthey're in. The Governor was telling me about when they announced the program, there was 3,000 slots, and about 10,000 people immediately signed on or tried to sign on.
Well, look, these wetlands act as a critical buffer between the rising tides and the communities at risk, protecting homes, property, and infrastructure against flooding. They also absorb carbon dioxide from the air. And we're right next to Route 101, andwhere cars and trucks emit a lot of carbon pollution.
What we're seeing here is an amazing success story of how you can work together to make our communities more climate-resilient. It matters. It matters. Resiliency matters.
You know, I've toured many sites across the country that clearly show climate change is a genuineis the existential threat to humanity. The existential threat to humanity.
Here in California, the Governoryou and I stood together with first responders near Monterey Bay after touring the damage that was done. The devastating storms caused historic flooding that killed 21 people. That comes on the heels of the worst droughts in California in more than a millennia and the highest sea-level rise in more than a century.
I've seen wildfire devastation across the West, burning more acres to the ground than there are square miles in the State of Maryland. That's how much got burned to the ground and all thejust flying over, just devastating.
There's been historic tornadoes and flooding in the Midwest and the Southeast.
And just last week, across the East Coast and Midwest, we saw what you've already seen here in California: millions of Americans sheltering indoors, the air not safe to breathe, orange haze covering the sky. It's incredible.
By the way, to address those wildfire smoke that's coming from Canada, we're sharing cutting-edge technology that's already used here in California to help detect early fires and help them in sending, in addition to that, firefighters and tankers as well.
Folks, the impacts we're seeing in climate change are only going to get more frequent and more ferocious and more costly. Last year alonelast year alone, natural disasters in America caused $165 billion in damage, just last year alone$165 billion in damage. But the worsening impacts are not inevitable.
Building on our incredible effort locally, my administration is doing all we can to help recover and build so we can be prepared toand adapt. You know, it's all part of my ""Invest in America"" agenda the Governor was referencing. It starts with the most significant climate investment law ever anywhere in the history of the world. Over billions and billions$368 billion369, to be precisein clean energy development, environmental justice, conservation, and so much more.
We will cut 1 billion tons of carbon emission a year, create millions of good-paying jobs. And it's already attracting billions of dollars in the private sector, because businesses are realizing it's overwhelmingly in their interest. As a matter of fact, a couple of businesses are suing banks because they want to consider whether or not they're environmentallyanyway. I won't get into all that. I'll get[laughter].
But I want to emphasize again: We're taking the most aggressive climate action ever. It's focused on mitigationwhich means historic investments in developing clean energy by reducing dependence on fossil fueland resilience, which means communitiescommunitiescan better withstand the impacts of climate change and extreme weather.
With a combination of the bipartisan infrastructure law and the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS and Science Act, we've invested more than $50 billion so far in climate resilience; nearly $9 billion to make transportation infrastructure more resilient by elevating roads and bridges above projected flood zones; $13 billion to decrease the wildfire risk and improve forest health and paying for firefighters who risk their lives every day.
Drought mitigation: $15.4 billion to bolster the West's resilience to drought. These investments are being made in the context of a megadrought affecting the Colorado River Basin.
Forty million40 millionAmericans already drinking water that thousands of farmers rely on forfor integration [irrigation; White House correction]. And 40 million count on that river, and so do the farmers.
Six-point-six billion dollars in coastal resilience restoration of reefs and construction of other infrastructure to mitigate storm damage, plus more than $17 billion from the bipartisan infrastructure law to bolster resilience for coastal water and waterways infrastructure, including funding to address food, floods, storms, hurricane risks, and restore coastal ecosystems.
Climate-smart agriculture: nearly $20 billion in funding for precisionirrigation and planting cover crops, plus a $1 billion America the Beautiful Challenge to accelerate locally led conservation efforts.
Folks, flood mitigation: $3.5 million [billion; White House correction] to reduce or eliminate the risk of repetitive flood damage to buildings, plus $1 billion in funding mitigation measures to increase community resilience, like supporting adaptations of hazard-resistant building codes.
And maybe most important, I've committed that by 2020 [2030; White House correction], we will have conserved 30 percent of all the lands and waters the United States has jurisdiction over and simultaneously reduce emissions to blunt climate impacts.
And we're on our way. Conservation of land and waterwe put more in conservation of land and water than any President in the history of the United States sincebut John Kennedy.
And we're leading the way in Palo Alto and East Palo Alto and to Belle Haven. For instance, a local nonprofit called Climate Resilient Communities gives communities[applause]. Thank you. Are you all part of that? Thank you. It gives members a voice in planning and adaptation.
I'm here today to announce that we're putting our critical climate investment to work.
Folks, first, starting tomorrow, the Department of Commerce will launch the first and largest competitive Climate Resilience Regional Challenge to provide $600 million to coastal and Great Lake communities that are building projects to protect against the impacts of climate change from sea-level rise, flooding, and storm surge.
We're investing in the people and places that have been hit the hardest, but who are also on the frontlines of leading us forward.
Folks, the second thing we're doing: The Department of Energy is going to announce that it's investing more than $2 billion to modernize our electric grid to be more climate resilient, including more than $67 million starting off in California.
That funding can help ensure our electric grid is stronger, that the lights and air conditioning and internet stay on during heat waves and storms and other climate events, so the lights can stay on in hospital operating rooms, nursing homes, and so many other critical care facilities.
And third, later this year, we're hosting the first-ever White House summit that convenes local, State, Tribal, and Territorial leaders focused on climate resilience.
It's going to include a roadmap for how these historic climate actions are going to build more climate-resilient communities all across America, saving lives and homes and providing peace of mind.
This is how we're going to meet the moment. This is how we're going tounfortunately, some of our MAGA Republican friends in Congress are continuing to try to undo all the progress we've already made in the first 2 years.
They were holding the country hostage over the debt limit unless I would gut the climate provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act. I was determined not to let that happen. With your significant helpand I mean that sincerelyall of you here, particularly Anna in the House and the Congress, we didn't let it happen.
And in the end, we didn't just protect some of the climate money and clean energy provisions. We protected every single, solitary one.
But this ain't your father's Republican Party. [Laughter] They're back at it again with another bill to repeal the same provisions. But with your help, we're going to stop them again.
Let me close with this. Throughout our history, we're the only nation in the world that has come out of every crisis we've entered stronger than we went into it.
We're doing it again here on the climate crisis.
When I think of climate, I think of jobs. When I think of climate, I think of innovation. When I think of jobsclimate, I think of turning peril into progress.
That's why I'm so optimistic about the future. I really am.
We just have to remember who in hell we are. We're the United States of America, for God's sake. There is nothingnothing, nothingbeyond our capacity if we work together.
And that's what all of you are doing herehave been doing and we're going to continue to do. And God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.
Let's go get 'em. Let's get this done.

2023-06-19 00:00:00,"Remarks at a Campaign Reception in Los Gatos, California","
Well, Shannon and Kev, thank you very, very much. And I want to thank your family for all you've been willing to do and standing up and speaking out.
You know, it is true thatI remember when I ran the first time, I made a speech at Independence Hall withone night, with a wholeI don't know how many peoplefive, six, seven hundred people. And I talked about that I thought democracy was at risk, and I defined what I thought democracy was.
And the press, understandably, was somewhat skeptical why the heck I was talking about democracy the way I did. It turns out, after that speech was over, for the next couple of weeks, it turned out, there were over 65 percent of the American people registered, saying that they were concerned as well.
You know, we're the most unique nation in the history of the world. We're uniquely a product of our political institutions, unlike any other nation. I mean, not that we're better or worse, just unique. We're in a situation where the vast majority of countries are formed based on ethnicity, on religion, on all things that don't relate to anything other than an idea.
We're based on an idea that we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men and women are created equal, et cetera. And we've never fully lived up to it, but we've never in the pastsince, I guess, way back in the Civil Warwalked away from it. We've never walked away from it.
And so I'll tell you a quick story. When Iwhen you got me elected, and you didwhen you got me elected, I walked inI didn't realize, even though I'd been in the Oval Office every day for 8 years in a row, 9 o'clock in the morning with BarackI didn't realize there was a requirement that the outgoing President be out of the office by 10 o'clock on the 20th and the incoming President could come inI think it was at 3 or 4 o'clock.
And so I asked my brother Jim, who has better taste than I do, to set up the office for me, from everything from picking the rug, to the desk, and that kind of thing. For real. And he brought along with him a Presidential historian named Jon Meacham. And Jon Meacham was helping out, and I was unaware of that at the time.
And so when I came in that day, the other guy didn't have to worry; he never showed up at all. But[laughter].
But at any rate, what happened was that I looked over at the mantelpiece. And a couple of you have been to the Oval since then; you're all welcome, by the way. I mean that sincerely.
Thethere's a picturea big portrait ofpaintinga big oneof Roosevelt. Well, I'm proud Roosevelt was a Democratic President, but I wondered why. And then there were four portraits that are much smaller: one, George Washington, which had always been over the mantel; and then one of Abraham Lincoln; and then oneand thenanyway, without going into all the detail, the bottom line was, I said, ""Why?""
And Meacham spoke up and he said: ""Well, not since Dwight""not sinceexcuse me, not since Roosevelt has any President inheritedsuch a circumstance internationally, where there was so much at stake, in terms of the world economy as well.
And then I said, ""Why Lincoln?"" He said, ""Well, the country has never been as divided since then."" And I started thinking about it.
But I announced when I ran, the first timeI said I was running for three reasons, and I meant it: One was to restore the soul of the Nation. By that, I meant restore the sense of dignity and honor, be that we would once again be looked at as a nation that was one that led by example a little bit. Secondly was to rebuild the middle class, which had taken a real hit the previous number of years. And the third reason was to unite the country again.
And the press, understandably, wasand a lot of people who were supporting me thought: ""Well, I'm not sure that makes any sense, especially the uniting part. No one can unite the country."" But I'm convinced that the vast majority of the American people still understand who we are and what we're about.
And so what we did was, when we, in fact, put together this program, the initiatives we had, was I said that we were going to move in a bipartisan way.
Well, guess what? We inherited a circumstance where we hadthe economy was in disarray; we werewe had an ""American first"" policy that was not doing very well around the world from our allies, fromanyway, not doing very well.
And in addition to that, we found ourselves in a circumstance where it was very difficult to convince the American people that we could get things done.
And so we worked very hard. And we ended up in the first almost, I guess, 20 months22 months initiallynow it's longercreating more jobs than any President has in 4 years: over 13 million 500 thousand jobs.
We also put ourselves in the position where we found ourselves inhaving toa circumstance where we were once again beginning to be respected by the rest of the world.
I've spent, I figureI think theymy staff figured it out: With other NATO and European and Far East leaders, but particularly heads of state in thein Europe, I've spent over 180 hours with them, either together in a group, individually, or on Zoom. Because they really are looking to what we think is important, what we thinkwhat we're willing to do.
When I first got to the first G-7 meetingthat's the seven largest economiesin London, in February, after I was elected, I sat down at a roundliterally, a round table. It was a beautiful area we were sitting in, outside andin southwest LondonI mean, southwest England.
And I said, ""Well, America is back."" And Macron looked at me, and he said, ""For how long?"" [Laughter] For how long? He wasn't being a wise guy; he wasit was genuine questions.
And then I got a comment from a guy I'd become friends with, Scholz of Germany, the Chancellor. He said: ""Mr. President, what would you think if tomorrow morning you picked up the paper here in the England, and the London Times had said, 'A thousand people broke down the doors of Parliament; killed several bobbies in order to overthrow the election'""? And I hadn't thought of it that way before.
But think how the rest of the world looked at what happened here, without makingblaming anybody, just what happened. What happened.
And so what we didwe worked very hard to try to bring our allies back together, which I think we have; unite the world. We have the idea of when I was toldand I was told, folks, I was going to try to get Japan engaged and change their attitude and budgetattitude toward Korea, their budget, in terms of their military budget and their engagement in Europe.
It's never happened before. Well, it's happened. They're engaged in a big way. In a big way. They've actually made an rapprochement with Chinawith thewithexcuse me, with South Korea after all these years since World War II. Things are moving.
Things are moving in terms of what's happening as well in Europe, in terms of the NATO cohesion, et cetera. We've got the Quad going.
My generic point isI guess the reason why I'm so optimistic is, the rest of the world is like everybody else: They want to get something done. They want to get back to some sense of normality. And, for example, the idea that there is this cohesion in Europe stilland remember, everyone assumed, and it was not an irrational assumption, that Putin was convinced that he could wait and just see NATO break up over the issue of Ukraine.
Soand then, at home, similar things happened. The idea that in a 1-week span every major environmental group would endorse me, and then the verythe following week, I'd be endorsed by a group of people whowhere you think would behave trouble with environmental groupsthe major labor unions, every major labor union in America for the first time this early. And thiscoherently supported a candidate.
And then wethe same thing acrossI guess what I'm trying to say is, I think there's a hunger for a unity based on rationality, not based on just unity for unity's sake, because people know that we've lost something when we lost that sort of centerhow can I say it?that glue that kind of held democracyrock bottom, as to who we were.
And so I'm confident about this election because of the people I'm standing before. But I don't mean I'm that kind of confident. But I'm confident because I think that there is a sense of wanting to finish the job.
We've created, as I said, 1-pointexcuse me, 13.4 million jobs, 800,000 manufacturing jobs. Inflationunemployment is down to near historic low, at 3.7 percent. Black unemployment low, Hispanic unemployment is extremely low, relative to where we are. Inflation is down 11 months in a row. You are a lot of veryyou're all very successful business women and men. You understand that everything is fragile.
But I think if we keep moving, we can get things done. And let me end by saying the things I want to get done.
I think it's critically important that we lock down thehow can I say it?the sensethe idea that there are more children being killed in America by gunshots than by any other[inaudible]it just makes no sense. I own two shotguns. I'm not a big hunter, but I used to target shoot.
But the point I'm making is that the idea that you could drive your car up here, park your car, and if some 14-year-old kidif you left the key in, it took the car and ran it off the road here and hurt somebody, you'reyou're civilly liable.
Well, you should have to lock up your guns. What's the big damn deal about that? Look at all theseall theseall these kids who have blown people away, large numbers.
You know, we should be in a position where we have universal background checks. We should be in a position where the idealook, AR-15s are weapons of war. And I think the reason whyand I think it's going to become clear pretty soonthe reason why: The only industry in America you can't sue is the gun manufacturers. Imagine if that were the law with regard towith regard to tobacco. How many people would be dead today, thatare alive because we've been able to take on tobacco?
And so there are so many things we can do in that area.
We can alsoit's about time that the ultimatefreedomthe right to choose should be a right left between a woman and her doctor. And so the idea is that now we're in a position where it's been ruled that it's not a constitutional guarantee, not guaranteed by theno place in the Constitution that guarantees it for the first time in 50-some years. It's pulled away.
So there's nothing that you're going towe're not going to be able to pass a constitutional amendment, but I'll tell you what we can do: We can pass a national law taking Roe v. Wade and codifying it in every State and making sure, if you have a majority of the Statesand we're going to be in a position where that becomes the law of the land.
But my point is thatthink of all theall the horror stories you've heard, not just the normal ones, but you know, a young womanpeople moving from one State to another.
You have a guy froma former football coach from Alabama is holding upI think it'sI'll ask my sonI think it's 57 flag appointmentsmilitary appointments for the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on down the line. Because the military said if you are in the military, you're having a troubled pregnancy, and you're in a State where you're not allowed to see the doctor perform anyany remedial operation on you, then you can get paidyou can have leave to go to where you can do that.
Well, he said, unless that's changed, he's holding up all theall thesewe're in awe're in aI mean, it'sit's just bizarre. I don't remember it happening before. And I've been around. I know I don't look like I've been around[laughter]but I've been around. I've been around a long time.
But the point I'm making is, there are so many things that are of consequence that we can solve. And the vast majority of people, all the data shows, support the positions we're generically taking. It's not like these are wacko ideas that we've come up with.
And so I think it's really important we sort of reinstill a sense of, I don't knowa sense of confidence in the Constitution, even though people don't think of it in exactly those terms.
But I'm basicallynow I'm talking too much. And the view is incredible. [Laughter] My view isI see you and theand the environmentyou have a bad view. You only see me. [Laughter]
But all kidding aside, whywhat am I supposed toam I going to takeBoss, come on up here, man.

The President. Steve, thank you. I used to dream of being charismatic. [Laughter] Anyway. All kiddingthank you. Thank you, thank you.
By the way, there's the real reason we're gathered here: We have two recent college graduates in the front row here. Stand up, guys. No, you got to stand up. I'm going to embarrass you. Stanford and Cal. That's the only reason I came out. I want to get to know who's going to be running the country later.
So Ilook, I want to thank Anna for allowing me toa passport into the district. Thank you, Anna. We've been working together a long, long time.
And the fact of the matter is that, you know, Anita is here somewhere. I don't know where there you are, Anita. Well, I tell you what: You're the only reason I came out. [Laughter] Thank you. Nono, you've beenyou've been wonderful.
And I want to thank everyone here because, quite frankly, I wouldn't be standing here talking to you were it not for most of the people in this room. A lot of you have been helping me for a long, long time. I go back 217 years, to Joe Cotchett. [Laughter] JoeJoe and I go back a long way. But I'm seriouslooking around the room, some of you've been with me a long time, and I truly appreciate it.
You knowyou know, a lot of world leaders I'vethe only thing that comes with serving a long time in office is you get to know a lot of people. And I've had an opportunity to meet virtually every world leader in the past 35 years or more. And one of the things that I get askedwell, let me put it this way: I waswhen Barack was President and I was Vice President, it was clear that President Huand that was his name at the time, the President of Chinaand his Vice President, Xiwhere Xi was going to be the successor, Vice President to become President in the near term.
And it wasn't appropriate for Barack to be able to spend a lot of time getting to know him, so it was an assignment I was given. And I traveled 17,000 miles with him, usually one on one. IweI'd have a simultaneous interpreter, and he had one too. And we got to know each other fairly well.
And one of the thingswe were in the Tibetan Plateau, and he asked me one day, and he saidone of our meetingshe said, ""Can you define America for me?"" And this is the God's truth. I said, ""Yes, in one word."" He said, ""What's that?"" I said, ""Possibilities.""
In America, we are the ""ugly Americans"" because we believe anything is possible when we work together. I'm being deadly earnest now. Think about it. When has there ever been a problem that we've decided to take on we thought we couldn't solve? As hard as it would be, whenwhen did that ever happen? And it hadn't happened.
There's never been a time when we haduntilof late, until the last time around, when we decided we're going to go it alone, ""America first."" We found ourselves in the position where there wasn't much coordination, and we stopped talking to one another.
You know, I told this story before: WhenI learned early on thatafter 8 years of sitting in the Oval Office every single morning at 9 o'clock with Barack, there were two questions he'd ask. We'd start off with kidding each other. He said, ""What do you think the temperature is in Hawaii?"" And I said, ""78."" [Laughter] That was ayou think I'm kidding. I'm not.
And then I'd say to himand I'd say, ""Remember, Barack,""I just called him Mr. President. ""Remember, Mr. President, all politics is personal,"" both international and national. You get togot to know the other team. You've got to know the other person, what's motivating that person and what's not motivating that person.
And so we spent a lot of time trying to figure out where this relationship was going to go, not only with China, but with Russia. You may remember, when I became President, I checked with the intelligence community to see if I couldwithout anyhurting any one individual, to letthe world know that for the first time since World War II, 135,000 people were going to invade another country.
And I said and I predictedand I toldat the time, it was cleared. And I told the Ukrainians that they were going to be invaded. They didn't believe it either. But for the first time, we hadeverno one contemplated the notion that there would be a Russian army that would invade another country with a hundredit ended up being 185,000 people.
The point I'm trying to make is this: You know, there's amy colleagues in the Senate used to always kid me because I was always quoting Irish poets. They thought I quoted Irish poets because I'm Irish. That's not the reason; they just happen to be the best poets in the world. [Laughter]
But Seamus Heaney, a poetand his wife I got to know very well after he passed awayhe wrote a poem called ""The Cure at Troy,"" and he said: ""All's changed, changed utterly. A terrible beauty has been born.""
All has changed, has changed utterly, both good and bad. It's a different world.
When I was deciding whether or not to run in nineteenturned arounddecided to run in 2020, I wasn't sure what to do, whether I was going to run or not. Because then I wasI started to write a book on whatAmerican inflection points, the things thatthose are things that occur within a relatively short span of time, less than a decade, that change the world for the next three, four, or five decades. It's happened about eight times in modern history. And we're at one of those junctures, in my view.
And then what happened was, along came what happened in Charlottesville. And that young woman that I metthe mom of the young woman who was killed. And the President was askedand those folksremember, they came walking out of theout of the woods, the fields, carrying torches, singing the same anti-Semitic bile that was sung inin Germany in the thirties and accompanied by White supremacists in the Ku Klux Klan. And my predecessor was asked, ""Well, whatwhat do you think?"" He said there were very good people on both sides.
That's when I knew things hadhad begun to change in a way that wasif we didn't move, it would be irreversible over a period of time.
And the reason I bother to say those things to you is, I think there's enormous prospects that we have as a consequence of the changes that you helped allow us to begin. Begin, not end. Begin. And many of those changes relate tothink about it: You know, we're toldI said I was running for three reasons, and a lot of you helped me last run.
I said I was running for three reasons. One, to restore the soul of this country. And that was to restore a sense of decency and honor and be able to talk with one another, be able to communicate back and forth with one another. The second reason was toto build the economy from the middle out and the bottom up, because when that happens, you all do very well, the wealthy do very well, and the middle class has a shot. And the disaffection of the middle class was growing, growing deeply. The percentage of the working class, high-school-educated population that voted Democrat was overwhelming. But they began to be left behind, not intentionally but it was the effectthat was a fact.
And think what we inherited when we came to office: an economy in disarray, a circumstance where we were the ""America first"" crowd. We weren'twe were justwe were disregarded, quite frankly, by the vast majority of our allies around the world.
And if you think I'm exaggerating, I'm not. The first meeting I attended as a U.S.as the United States President was in England, in the southeast of Francesoutheast of England, for the G-7 meeting, all thethe seven largest economies. And I sat down. We were seven of us at a round table. And I sat down, and I said, ""America is back."" And the French President looked at me and he said: ""For how long? For how long?""
And then the Chancellor of Germany looked at menew to the job himselflooked at me, and he saidhe said: ""What would you think, Mr. President, if tomorrow you woke up and in the London Times the headline was, 'A thousand people broke into the Parliament, broke down the doors of the House of Commons, two bobbies were killed, and in the process, they tried to stop the transfer of power'? What would you think?""
And I hadn't thought of it that way before, and I don't know that any of you have. Imagine the impact it's had on the rest of the world. The United States, all of a sudden, January 6I'm not trying to make a legal case, I'm just talking about the course of history. Imagineimagine how we'd feel if that was the case.
And so I had two jobs you elected me to do. First was to reestablish American leadership in the world, not so we could beat our chestsbecause if we don't do it, no one gets it done. No one has the influence, the power, the consequence, or the history to get it done. Nobody. It doesn't mean we're better than anybody else. It meansbut we are more unique than anybodythan another country.
You know, there's aevery other country in the world is based on theirtheir country, as a consequence of ethnicity, religion, geographyor something other thanother than geography. And we're the only country in the world that we're united based on an idea. That's whatand that's not hyperbole, that's a fact. Think about it. The only country organized based on an idea: that we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men and women are created equal, endowed by their Creator with certain rights, et cetera, et cetera.
We've never lived up to it, but we never walked away from it completely. And we've been thewe've been the linchpin that most democracies around the world look to to keep things moving. Madeleine Albright was right when she said we're the essential nation.
And so the point I'm trying to make here is that we had an obligation to try to reunite the world. I have spent, because of your helpI haven't been ableI've spent over now, they tell me, about 180 hours with European heads of state and allies, including the Japanese as well, who have come alongcome along a big way. And in terms of pulling these countries together.
If you notice, Putin was certain when hevirtually certain when he invaded that he was going to split NATO, that NATO would never stay together. NATO is more united than it's ever been in an entire history of NATO, because we've worked together. And it's critically important, and that was the job that I had.
I'm going to say something outrageous. I think I know as much about American foreign policy as anybody living, including Dr. Kissinger. That's what I've done my whole lifefor the last 270 years. [Laughter]
But the second pointthe second thing was, we had to figure out how to unite the country. And the press, understandablyit's not aI'm not criticizing the press when I say thisthe press sort of made light of my saying we've got to unite America. How can a democracy function without thewithout the consent of the Government, without cooperation? How does that work? I don't know any place that ever worked.
And so we spent a lot of time working on that. And when I said, Joe, that we're going to have bipartisanship, people looked at me like I was crazy. Because remember, they said: ""Well, Biden was a real bipartisan leader when he was a Senator. And he was known for being able to[inaudible]. But this is different."" Well, guess what? We came up with a trillion-200-billion-dollar bipartisan infrastructure bill. It's going to change[applause].
How in God's namehow in God's namecan we lead the world when we rank numberI think it's 16 in quality of infrastructure? How does that happen? It doesn't happen.
And we used to invest a significant amount of ourout of our entire GBTGDP, we invested on average 2 percent of our GDP on research and development. I'm in the middle of Silicon Valley; you guys have forgotten more about this than most people around the world know. No, I'm not beingI'm not being solicitous. I'm being deadly earnest.
But we stopped doing it; 0.7 percent was the max we, in fact, invested in research and development in America. The United States of America. So that's why I came up with this legislation relating to how we're going to deal with the whole notion of dealing with investments.
And, for example, when we did thewhen I put together a legislationor proposed the legislation relating to dealing with computer chips, sources ofyou know, we talked aboutyou all understood, but a vast majority of people in America don't understand what talking about source of product is. And we never talked about source before.
But, all of a sudden, we found ourselvesand we invented the computer chip. We used to have25 years ago, we produced 40 percent of the chips, which are needed for virtually everything now, as youI need not tell any of you. Well, guess what? We were down to 10 percent. How can thathow could that have happened?
So we changed the law. We invested significant amounts of money. We attracted $450 billionbillion dollars in private sector investment in that. $450 billion.
We're in a situation now where we have awe have overall thelook, $300 billion just for building fabs, justbuilding chip factories now.
You know, there's a situation[applause]but the reason why I thought that was so important, beyond America's place in the world, was, you know, we kept losing those blue-collar workers.
You know, my dad used to say: ""Joey a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay. We're going to make it.'""
We'll, they're stripped of their dignity. We started to decide to go where the labor was cheapest. We'd export jobs and import product. Well, there's a little law that existed since 1935. It says, ""Buy America."" Any moneyany amount of money that Congress gives me, I can insist that it be purchased 100-percent American manufacturer. And consistent with the WTO. I can insistbut no one was willing to do it.
Well, guess what? You better be buying American and hiring Americans. And if you don't have the capacity, we make exceptions. We make exceptions.
But, folks, the point is thatguess what?it's created thousands and thousands and thousands of jobs.
And, for example, the fab that Intel is building outside of Columbus, Ohio, that fab is employing 12,000 people: 5,000 people working in the fab when it's constructed and 7,000 people building it. Well, the 7,000 people are getting paid prevailing wage. And guess what? The 3,000the 5,000 people that are going to work, they're going to have an average salary of an excess of $120,000 a year. And you don't need a college degree.
All of a sudden, we're paying attention to blue-collar workers again. We're building the country from the middle out and the bottom up. And the wealthy are still doing very, very well.
We also did the same thing with regard towe used toyou know, the VA can negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies. Pharmaceutical companies aren't bad guys, just so they charge Americans more than anybody else. Not a joke.
The most significant medicine you needprescription you need, you can go to Toronto, Canada; Paris, France; Madrid, Spain, and buy it cheaper from the same exact manufacturer as you buy it here.
So we said, because they can negotiate drug prices for veterans, we should be able to drug negotiate drug prices for thefor Medicare. And guess what? It had the added advantage of reducing the debt by $168 billion, just as it relates to one thing: insulin.
But here's my point: My point is, we did thiswe created 13 million-plus jobs in the first 2 years, more than any President ever has in 4 yearsin 4 years. We're now in a situation wherewe're in a situation where we're able to do things that we couldn't do before.
And allthis entire period, all this spendingthe ""big-spending Biden""guess what? We reduced the debt by $1.7 trillion at the same time because of the ingenuity of the people in this room.
You know what I said when I was talking about that Intel project? Sis it SM? Whatwhatwhat's the outfit in South Korea?
Audience member. SMC.
The President. SMC. I met with the CEO of SMC in South Korea. And I said, ""Why are you making this investment?""
And they're investing a significant amount of money$100 million they committedin the ""field of dreams,"" I call it, that thousand acres just offjust west ofof Columbus, Ohio.
And I saidyou know, I asked him, ""Why are you doing it?"" And he said: ""Because it's the safest investment we can make anywhere in the world, in the United States. And secondly, you have the best, finest workers.""
Well, a lot of you probably are wondering why I'm so prounion. I'm pro- 
Audience member. Woo-hoo!
The President. I'mwell, I'm prounion for a simple reason: what people underestimateand I thinkI've watchedI've met with the Business Roundtable. I've met withand II asked them at the meeting we had with about 40 members of the Business RoundtableI said, ""You guys are wondering why I'm prounion."" I said: ""Let me ask you a question. When I was Vice President, I visitI met with 352 of you out of the Fortune 500. And I asked you one thing: 'What do you need most?'""
You know what they said: an educated workforce. But you don't educate your workforce anymore. You don't invest the money in educating your workforce.
I come from the State of DuPont: Delaware. When I got elected 200 years ago, DelawareDuPont was the eighth largest corporation in America. Every new enterprise they engaged in, they spent the money educating their own folks. Now the public gets to do it.
So why do you oppose my effort to invest more in education? And guess what? We've got support now, investing in education.
My generic point is the same. There's so much we can do. And we can do it without hurting anyone, just growing the economy.
And look, one of the things that happenedand I'll stop with thisone of the things that happened when thelet me back up so I say it this way. How many of you are not from this area?
[At this point, a phone rang.]
[Laughter] He's calling again, isn't he? He keeps calling me. I don't know why. [Laughter]
No, all kidding aside. How many you are not from Silicon Valley? And how many are you from smaller Midwestern towns or near? You know what happens when the factory closes. The soul of the community is lost. Not a joke. It's not only the loss of the jobs. It's the loss of their sense of self-worththeir sense of self-worth.
And so, one of the things we're doing now is we'reall these offices are investing throughout the Midwest, throughout the Southin the South.
Matter of fact, I'm going to show up for a major initiative and investment that's taking place in North Georgia, in the home of Marjorie Taylor Greene. [Laughter] It's a multibillion-dollarit's a multi-multimillion-dollar project. Okay? But I'm going to be there with a spade to turn the dirt, because I saidand I mean itI represent all Americans, whether they're Democrats or Republicans or whoever they are.
Because, look, we've got to unite the country. We've got to let people know what we're doing.
And soany rate, there are a number of thingsand oneone last thing I want to talk a little bit about, and then I'll hush up, because I was told that I'm not going to get to get questions from y'all.
A couple things. The environment: The existential threat to the United States and to humanity, not a joke, is environmentclimate change, if we do nothing about it.
You know, it used to be a whole hell of a lot of people who thought that climate change was not an issue. Well, I have now flown over more burned-down forest in helicoptersa lot with your Governor, I might addas a consequence of what's happened inbecause of climate change than you can imagine. As much territory, since I've come into office, has burned to the ground that makes up the entire geography of the State of Maryland. That's how much has burned to the ground in the United States.
When I was out here about 3 years ago saying I worried about the Colorado River drying up, everybody looked at me like I was crazy. They looked at me like when I said I worried about Putin using tactical nuclear weapons.
It's real. But it's all doable. We canwe can do it. We can deal with it. We can make it happen. And we can create millions of good-paying jobs.
And what we can do when we do thisand, by the way, thatwe're in a situation where, in terms of thedealing with the environment, there is a broad political coalition that's beginning to form. The idea that I was able to, for example, get endorsements by every single major environmental group and, at the same time, every major union in America. I mean, seriously, if I had said that to you 2 years ago, what are the prospects of that?
But guess what? Everybody is kind of figuring it out. And by the way, the reason I push unions so much is they're not a bunch of thugs that are portrayed by many people. What they are isthey're blue-collar workers who have to go back to college, in effect, for 3 to 5 years in an apprenticeship, getting paid less in order to get the license to be able to be an electrician, get the license to be able to bego down the list.
Anyway, I made a commitment. I made a commitment that my term as President of the United States, I was going to make sure that 30 percent of all of our lands and all of our waters under American jurisdiction would be conserved by the year 2030.
And we're on target to get it done. For example, in Cape HaleCamp Hale in Colorado, 500excuse me50,000 acres. Boundary Waters in Minnesota, 225,000 acres. Spirit Mountain in Nevada, 5,000500,000 acres. The Castner Range in Texas, over 608600excuse me6,600 acres. Alaska, 25,000 acres I put in conservation: the Tongass Forest, Bristol Bay, the AtlanticArctic Ocean, and North Slope.
In addition to that, there are multiple, multiple miles around Hawaii that are off limits now to moving in terms of anything other than conservation. And so
And, by the way, we're going to reduce emissions by 2030 in the world byof the United States by 50 to 52 percent.
We put so much money into the power grid. How many of your fires out here have been because of those high-tension wires that have come down as a consequence of storms, tornadoes, et cetera?
The end result is the power gridwe're now gettingand your power companies and others around the worldaround the country decided they're going to put it underground. It's five to six times more expensive, but, with our help, we're going to be able to get it done. It's going to save millions of acres of land.
We're in a situation where we also haveI was able to get, on the South Lawnand this is not me just reminding people, but reminding what they really were about. I got everybody lasta year ago last summer on the South Lawn, all the auto companies in Detroit. And they agreed.
Mary Robinson [Barra; White House correction], the Chairman of the Board of General Motors, was saying that she was suing the State of California because you had a higher standardemission standard than they did. And she said no State could have a standard lower than that of the United States Government.
Well, guess what? I got a phone call after that meeting with her and all these folks on the South Lawn, saying she dropped her suit and she committed to go all electric by 2035. Know what that means?
And this is why everybody was a little suspect, because I didn't announce my environmental plan immediately because I wanted to bringbe sure I was able to bring labor along, just because we needed to bring them along.
Guess what? The end result of that is thefor example, the Electrical Workers Union is going to be employbuilding 500,000 EV stations throughout the country500,000. And every bit of evidence shows that when you build the gas stations in the old days, back in the 1900s, and theguess what? You end up building the equivalent of a McDonald's. You end up building an equivalent of otherother vehiclesother stores. It builds economic growth.
And soand by the way, thewe also have in my formermy original home State of Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia, in that part of the world, we have thousands of uncapped wellsgas and oil wellsthat are just spewing methane.
Well, now we're paying the same people to dig them, to cap them. And it's going have a profound impact on the environment in those areas.
And so I guess what I'm trying to say is, you know, a comprehensive tragedystrategy hereand I'll end with this, on the environmentis that, in the real world, agriculture60,000 farms now plant cover crops, which we were talkingI was talking to someone in here about Brazilcover crops that absorb the pollution of the air, taking it into the ground60,000.
We have, as I said, a circumstance where solar panel manufacturing has increased multifold. And what they want to get rid ofguess what?you hear your neighbors who wantthey get a tax credit for putting solar panels on the roof or buying certain electric materialexcuse mecertain products that, in fact, aredon't generate as much energy intakewindows and doors, less air conditioning or heat escaping. It's having a profound impact on the consumption of energy.
We're alsoheavy industry companies are investing billions of dollars in clean construction materials, like clean steel and clean cement. I thought I knew a fair amount about the environment, about soI didn't realize until 8 years ago how muchhow much is spewed into the air as a consequence of the production of cement and steel, how much goes into the air in terms of pollution.
Well, now we're making clean steel and clean cement. So it is having a profound impact.
I guess what I'm saying is that factories all over the country and Qcell solar factories are being built. And the end result of all of this is bipartisan budget deal with nearly a trillion dollars in deficit reduction on top of the $1.7 trillion that I've already saved.
And we can do a lot more to lower costs. But, again, I'm beginning to bore myself. [Laughter]
But I guess what I'm trying to say is theand I'll end with thisthe gigantic issues of the daywhat are the things that are going to be consequential to our grandchildren and our great-grandchildren? Whether they have clean air to breathe. Whether there's a world in which it's more likely that it's status quo ante, in terms of peace sustained, or there's war. Which is it? And I think we know the answer.
And I think we're on the trail to making sure that we can do both: have a safer world because of America's engagement in a way that it has in the pastin the distant past of nowas well as making sure that we have an economy that benefits everyone, because there's nothing worse than denying somebody who's busting their neck the dignity of their job.
At any rate, I'm going to hush up. Thank you all very much.

Q. Good morning, sir.
The President. The only reason we're going to Philadelphia: It's my wedding anniversary. [Laughter] And we figured Iwith my Philly girl, we'd go to Philly. You can smile; it's okay. It's a lousy joke.
Anyway, Ithe reason I'm excited about today is, just like what we did last week in thewith the environmental groups. I thinkI'm told this is the first time ever this early that every single union has endorsed me. I've been told that's never happened before. And the good news about that is, I also met yesterday with some businesspeople. Businesspeople and unions are beginning to work together like not before.
And so I'm excited aboutthis is the beginning of something big, in terms of changing the economic balance.
2024 Presidential Election 
Q. What kind of campaign do you think you're going to have? Do you think it's going to be a nasty campaign this whole year, the way your opponent's going after you?
The President. Well, it depends on who the nominee is.
China-U.S. Relations 
Q. On China, Mr. President, can Secretary Blinken ease tensions with China on this trip, do you think?
The President. Sure. Well, look, China has some legitimate difficulties unrelating to theunrelated to the United States. And I think one of the things that that balloon caused was not so much that it got shot down, but I don't think the leadership knew where it was and knew what was in it and knew what was going on. It wasI think it was more embarrassing than it was intentional.
And so I'm hoping that, over the next several months, I'll be meeting with Xi again and talking about legitimate differences we have, but also how there's areas we can get along.
[At this point, several reporters spoke at once.]
Ukraine/North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
Q. Mr. President, are you going to make it easier for Ukraine to join NATO?
The President. No.
The President. Because they've got to meet the same standards. So I'm not going to make it easier. I think they've done everything relating to demonstrating the ability to coordinate militarily, but there's a whole issue of: Is their system secure? Is it noncorrupt? Does it meet all the standards everyoneevery other nation in NATO does?
I think they will. I think they can. But it's not automatic.
Thank you.
Russia/Nuclear Weapons 
Q. Do you have a comment on Russia's deployment of tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus?
The President. I've commented on that many times. It's totally irresponsible.

2023-06-17 00:00:00,"Remarks on the Interstate 95 Overpass Collapse and Federal Rebuilding Efforts in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","
The President. Hello, folks. We just finished aan aerial tour ofsurvey of I-95 andfrom the tanker truck explosion, the damage done.
And, to the people of Philadelphia, I want to say that we're with you. We're going to stay with you andas this is rebuiltuntil it's totally finished. And we're going to try to do that in as quick a time as possible.
And I told the Governor there's no more important project right now in the country, as far as I'm concerned. I'm directing my teamnot figuratively, but literallyto move heaven and earth to get it done as soon as humanly possible.
So, since Sunday morning, we've worked closely with Governor Shapiro, Senators Casey and Fetterman, and Representative Boyleit's his districtand Mayor Kenney to provide the necessary Federal assistance to support an all-hands-on-deck response to this crisis. And it is a crisis.
And I want to thank these officials for working collaboratively, effectively, efficiently with each other and with our Federal team.
I also want to thank the firefirst responders who dealt with the immediate aftermath and the workers onsite. We saw some of them today as we flew over the site. They've been working 24/7 to clear the debris.
Within hours of the crash, officials from the U.S. Department of Transportation were on the ground, supporting Pennsylvania officials to get the site cleared and be able to start the rebuilding. The immediate release of $3 millionit was called ""quick release"" emergency fundswere made to offset the cost of repairs.
This is just a downpayment, obviously. It's a lot more than that. We're going to be getting a lot more Federal funding out the door in the coming weeks.
Additionally, Pennsylvania has already received $8.9 billion from the bipartisan infrastructure law, including $6.5 billion for transportation projects, which gives the Governor some flexibility to move existing State funds to this project right away, knowing that this money is in the bank.
Also, union crews have been hard at work 24/7 since the crash. Operating engineers, the laborers, the carpenters, cement finishers, teamsters, and the ironworkers are going to help rebuild. And they're doingthey're doing it right now.
And folks here know that the crews finished demolition on Thursday, ahead of schedule, and now they're working on emergency repairs to quickly and safely reopen the roadway to traffic.
The Federal GovernmentI've committed we're going to reimburse 100 percent of this phase of the work in well over the first 200 days. And then, after that, 90 percent of the work. We'll be here until the end. We won't leave until it's finished.
And that's why I want toI asked Mayor Landrieu, who runs my operation relative to the infrastructure legislation, to lead the effort. He knows, as mayor, what it takesMayor Kenney, as you knowto get things done. HeNew Orleans never had any problems like tornados and hurricanes and floods and the like. But, all kidding aside, he's on iton this every day.
We're using materials made of recycled glass, manufactured here in Delaware County, Pennsylvania. And the design of the project is incredibly innovative in order to get this work done in record time. We're also working with local officials to redirect traffic, minimize congestion, andalong alternative routes.
Look, I grew up not very far from here, just across the line in PennsylvaniaI mean from Pennsylvaniain Claymont, Delaware. I know how important this stretch of highway is not just to Philly, but to the entire Northeast corridor and to my home State.
Over 150,000 vehicles travel on it every day, including 14,00014,000trucks. It's critical. It's critical to our economy, and it's critical to our quality of life.
We're going to continue to do everything we can within our power to get this back open as quickly and easily as possible. We're not leaving until it's done. And we're going to get this done, God willing, in record time.
I'm looking forward to hearing more from the folks on the ground in a moment.
And now I'm going to turn it over to the Governor, who is doing one hell of a job. He gets tired of my calls, I think, but he's doing a hell of a job.
Thank you.
Gov.
Governor Joshua D. Shapiro of Pennsylvania. Thank you.
The President. There you are.
Gov. Shapiro. Thank you very much.
[At this point, Gov. Shapiro, Sens. Robert P. Casey, Jr., and John K. Fetterman, Rep. Brendan F. Boyle, and Mayor James F. Kenney of Philadelphia made remarks; no transcript was provided. Mayor Kenney concluded his remarks as follows.]
Mayor Kenney. But hethe President of the United States called me to see what he could do to help us. And that says all you need to know about this President and this man here. So thank you very much, Mr. President. We really appreciate it, and we love you. Thank you.
The President. I might add, if I didn't, I'd be sleeping alone. [Laughter] Do I have to explainI'd better explain thatsome don't know what I'm taking about. My wife's a Philly girl. [Laughter]

2023-06-17 00:00:00,"Remarks at a Campaign Rally With Union Members in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","
The President. Hello, Philadelphia! Hello, organized labor, union labor! There's labor, and there's union labor.
Folks, it feels good to be home. I'm Joe Biden. I'm Jill Biden's husband and damn proud of it. A Philly girl, a card-carrying member of her union.
And, David, thank you for that introduction. And I want to thank LizPresident Liz Shuler, who's been a friend of mine for a long, long time and all of you.
Folks, if I can go off script for a second here, I want to say something: You know, I've been doing this a long time, but I've never felt the sense of camaraderie and pride that I feel today in this year. I really mean it.
Audience member. We love you!
The President. No, no, no, no. I'm not sayingI'm not saying
Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!
The President. Let melet me just say one thing very seriously: You know, I think this is the first timeand I've been around, as I said, a whilein history where, last week, every single environmental organization endorsed me.
No, no, no. And this week, for the first time I'm aware of, the AFL-CIO endorsed this early, and every union as well. Because we're coming together.
I look out in this crowd, and I see a lot of old friends, a lot of folksas they say in Claymont, Delawarewho brung me to the dance. I told you when I ran for President I'd have your back. And I have. But you've had my back as well.
And I'm moreexcuse me for getting a little emotionalI'm more honored by your endorsement than you can imagine. Coming this early, it's going to make a gigantic difference in this campaign.
You know, there are a lot of politicians in this country who can't say the word ""union."" Because you know I'm not one of them. I'm proud to say the word. I'm proud to be the most pro-union President in American history. I promised you I would be. But what I'm really proud aboutwhat I'm really proud aboutis being reelected the most pro-union President in history.
Look, I want to thank Kamala for all she's doing to fight for working families.
Look, folks, I've said many times: Wall Street didn't build America, you did. You did. Not a joke. I've been saying this for a long time, long before I ran for President. The middle class built this country, and you built the middle class.
Electricians, carpenters, ironworkers, steelworkers, laborers, bricklayers, plumbers, pipe fitters, police officers, firefighters, educators, nurses, painters, airline workers, custodians, transit workers, steel- and metalworkers, grocery store workers, hotel workers, so many others.
Audience member. Millwrights!
The President. And let me tell you somethingmillwrights as well. [Laughter]
If the investmentthe investment bankers in this countrythink about itI mean, this is not a criticism of them, but if the investment bankers in this country went on strike tomorrow, no one would much notice in this room. [Laughter] No, think about this in a literal sense. But if this room didn't show up for work tomorrow or next Monday, the whole country would come to a grinding halt. So tell metell mewho matters more in America?
Folks, I'm looking forward to this campaign. I want you to know why: because you've got a story to tell. We've got a story to tell. We've got a record to run on. And most importantly, we're not only changing this country, we're transforming it.
Just think back: Remember what it was like when I came to officewe came into office. Remember the mess we inherited. The pandemic was raging. ThinkI want you to really think about this. I mean this sincerely. It's not a campaign speech; it's a speech about the future of this country.
The economy was reeling. Barely 3 million people had been fully vaccinated. Supply chains were broken. Businesses were shutting down. Schools were closed.
You had carsremember carsnot just old jalopies, carsmodern cars, new carslined up for miles and miles just to get a box of food put in the back of their car for their families.
Our allies in Europe and around the world heard the last President saying our foreign policy was ""America first."" And for the first time since the Second World War, our friends began to wonder whether they couldthe United States could be relied on.
Now, look at where we are today. We've united NATO once more in a way it has never been united before. It's a wonder we're[applause].
We've created 13 million new jobs since I became President. That's more jobs in little over 2 years than any President has created in one 4-year term. The unemployment rate is down to nearly a 50-year low at 3.7 percent. I've seen record lows for Black unemployment and Hispanic unemployment as well.
We've created 800,000 manufacturing jobs. And as you heard me say before: Where in God's name is it written that America can't lead the world again in manufacturing?
Inflation has come down 11 months in a row andgoing to continue to come down. Today, it's less than half of what it was 1 year ago.
Folks, this didn't just happen. We made it happen. I came to office
Audience member. You did it!
The President. No, you guys. No, I beingI'm being sincere. You guys did.
I came to office with a theory and a plan. The theory was this
Audience members. You did it!
The President. No, please listen. I mean it. I want you to listen to this one. [Laughter]
It was time to end the trickle-down economics theory: You know, the wealthy do well, we all do well.
Forty years of handing out excessive tax cuts to the wealthy and big corporations had been a bust. Democrats as well as Republicans did it. All of it had doneall it had done was hollow out the middle class; blow up the deficit; ship jobs overseas; strip the dignity and pride and hope out of a community, one after another, all across America as the factories shut down.
I'm pretty sure you saw in your home what I saw in mine. Not a lot trickled down from my parents' kitchen table when I was growing up.
So we're changing. We decided to replace this theory with what the press has now called ""Bidenomics."" I don't know what the hell that is. [Laughter] But it's working.
Let me tell you what it's about. It's about building an economyliterally, not figurativelyfrom the bottom up and the middle out, not the top down. Because when the middle class does well, everybody does well. [Applause] Nothe poor have a way up, and the wealthy don'tdothey just do just fine.
But like I said, I didn't just come into office with a theory; I came with a plan. And it started with passing the American Rescue Plan, a plan to vaccinate the Nation and get our economy going again.
And that's exactly what it did. It put money in people's pockets, provided a lifetimelifeline for businesses to stay afloat. And one study concluded that it kept 7 million people in their homesnot losing their homes.
Oh, it did one more thing that matters a lot to you: It included the Butch Lewis Act to protect the pensions of millions of workers. And that was a big deal. That was a big deal.
I committed to you, and we worked together. Youyougot that passed for me. It's one of the most significant achievements to union workers and retirees in over 50 years, and that's a God-natural fact. But not a single Republican in Congress voted for it, but we still got it done because of you[applause]because of you.
Nextnextwe passed the bipartisan infrastructure law because of you.
We can't have the strongest economy in the world without the best infrastructure in the world. How can that be? Can you believe we used to be the best infrastructurehad the best infrastructure in the world, rated number one? But today, we rate number 1313. Twelve other nations have betterand by the way, how in the hell can you grow an economy without an infrastructure? Notnot a joke.
Under my predecessor, ""Infrastructure Week"" became a punchline. On my watch, we're making ""Infrastructure Decade"" a headline. And that's what this law is all about. It's about investing in America, in our roads, bridges, ports, airports, clean water, high-speed internet, and so much more.
We've already statedstarted some 32,000 projects all across America. As Mayor Kenney knows, none of them are more consequential than right here at I-95 in Philly. In fact, if you go to invest.gov, you'll see a map that's going to show every single project in this country.
And by the way, it creates tens of thousands of good-paying jobs with prevailing wage. And you don't need a college degree to make a decent income.
You've heard me say before many times, but it sticks in my mind. My dad used to have an expressionand I swear to God this is what he would say, not a joke. He'd say: ""Joey, remember, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about being able look at your child in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay. We're going to make it.'""
That's what this is about. He was right, and I'm determined to make it a reality for every family in this country.
But look, if I needed any reminder about how important infrastructure was in the country, I got a reminder just a few days ago right here in Philly. I visited the damaged section of I-95. We're working closely with Governor Shapiro and Senator Casey and Fetterman and Congressman Boyle and Mayor Kenney to rebuild it.
I've instructed my team to prove that the old saw is wrong. I'm instructing my team to move heaven and earth to get it done. And thanks to some smart thinking and some innovative design and using materials right here in Pennsylvania, we're going to get it done in record time because it's so important to the economy not only of Philly, but the entire Northeast Corridor and every community.
Third, we passed the CHIPS and Science Act. I kept saying for a long while here: We used to be on the cutting edge of science and technology. We used to invest 2 percent of our entire GDP in research and development. You know what it is now? Got down to .7 percent. And you wonder why the hell the rest of the world is catching up and, in some places, it was moving ahead.
Well, America got a wakeup call with the pandemic. We didn't think much about supply chains. People wonder what the hell you talk about 5 years agotalking about supply chains. They know now.
Well, guess what? We know we can never again be so vulnerable.
One key component is semiconductorsthose little, tiny, small computer chips, smaller than the fingerprintfingertip, I should saythat affect nearly everything in our lives from cell phones, automobiles, refrigerators, the most sophisticated weapons systems the United States military has.
America invented these chips. But, over time, fromwe went from producing 40 percent of the world's chips to then producing less than 10 percent. But we're turning that around.
Now, the private sectorbecause I decided we're going to get this donethe private sector is investing a record $470 billion in advanced manufacturing right here in the United States foras well as clean energy in America, again, creating good-paying jobs, a prevailing wage, changing people's lives.
And fourth, we passed the Inflation Reduction Act. It gave Medicare the power to negotiate lower prescription drug prices[applause]just like the VA has been able to do.
You know, folks, the same drug company making the same prescription, if theyif you go to buy it in Paris, it's cheaper than the United States. Go to buy it in any major country in the world, it's cheaper than the United States. How in the hell can that happen?
Well, guess what? I and many others have been trying to get this done for decades, but by the time they triedthey tried and tried, but Big Pharma always was able to stop them.
Not this time. This time, we took on Big Pharma, and we won. Now, seniors on Medicare, instead of paying 400 bucks a month for insulin, they're paying $35 a month. It's life-changing.
And it's not just good for people who need lifesaving prescriptions, it's notit's good for the nation's budget as well. Guess what? The first round of cuts in prices that we've been able to negotiate saves the taxpayer $160 billion. Hear me? [Applause]
No, no, we're not spending money. We're saving money, because we don't have to pay out an additional $160 billion for the same drug coverage. That's pretty nice, I think. Doing more for people and costing taxpayers less money to do itthat's a good objective.
And this bill includes the biggest investment ever not only in America, but anywhere in the world when dealing with climate change: $369 billion. And the investment isn't only going to help us save the planet, it's going to create jobslots of jobs, tens of thousands of good-paying union jobs.
Now, let me tell you[applause]. Now, let me tell you what one of the core principles is throughout everything I've done: Make it in America. We're beginning to make things again with American workers, American products, manufacturing in American plants. For too long, we exported jobs for cheaper labor costs abroad and imported more expensive products that weren't of a quality we needed.
We're not going to do that anymore. Under my plan, under Bidenomics, we're creating jobs at home and exporting products abroad. Union jobs.
And here's the thing: We're doing all this by cutting the deficit. The budget agreement I just negotiated cuts the deficit by $1 trillion, and we didn't give up anything of consequence.
That's on top of my first 2 years asmy first 2 years as President, I've cut the deficit by more than any President has in American history: $1.7 trillion cut from the deficit while doing these things. And I've been able to cut the deficit while protecting all the critical investments I just talked about, as well as protecting Social Security and Medicare from being cut.
You may remember, when I did the State of the Union, they startedI said did any of these guys want to cut Social Security and Medicare. And they said, ""Liar, liar!"" And so I stopped. I hadn't planned on it. I stopped, and I said, ""Oh, how many of you want to cut Social Security?""
Audience member. No one!
The President. Andnono, I'm notno, I asked them. I asked the Republicans. [Applause] Nohere, listen to this. Remember, I said, ""How many of you want it cut?""
And all of the sudden, the ones calling me liars was completely silent. And I saidI said: ""The spotlight is on you all now. How many of you promise not to cut Social Security?"" And they all said, ""We won't cut it."" Guess what? It's not cut. I'd never negotiated at a State of the Union before.
Audience member. You called them out, Joe!
The President. Yes, that's a fact. [Laughter]
One thing didn't get done in that budget agreement was dealing with the Tax Code. I think we all know: Nobody, including those who would do very well, but aren't super, superwealthynobody thinks the Tax Code is fair.
No, I'm serious. It's just simply not fair. [Laughter] How could it be fair when 55 of the largest corporations in America paid zero in Federal income tax on $40 billion in profit?
Audience members. Boo!
The President. Nowell, guess what? We need to get rid of some of these ridiculous special interest tax loopholes, like the one for Big Oil. Big Oil made $200 billion in profit last year, and they got a $30 billion tax break on top of it.
Audience members. Boo!
The President. Some of the hedge fund managers and crypto tradersthese things are going to change, I promise you, if I have anything to do with it. And the ideawe used to have about 750 billionaires in America. Now, they tell me it's about a thousand, because of the last administration.
Well, guess what? You know whatyou know what percentage they pay in taxes? Eight percent. E-i-g-h-t.
Audience member. What do you pay, Joe?
The President. I pay a hell of a lot more than that, man. [Laughter] So do you.
And by the way, they pay at a lower tax rate than schoolteachers, than firefighters, probably anyone in this room.
Audience members. Joe! Joe! Joe!
The President. It's time they paid a minimum tax. I don't mind them being billionaires. Just pay your fair share, man.
The bottom line is this: It's time that big corporations and the very wealthy start paying their fair share. I made a promiseand I'll keep it for next 4 years if I'm electedthat no one making under $400,000 will see a penny of their Federal taxes go up. And they haven't. I kept that promise, and I will keep it.
But it's about time the superwealthy start paying their fair share. So in this timethis campaign, I'm going to go to the country and ask them if they giveif they agree with me, it's time for everyone to start paying their fair share.
Folks, look, let me close with this. I truly believe this country is about to take off. I really believe it. Notmy word. The investment we've made in these past 3 years have the power to transform this country in thefor the next five decades.
And guess who's going to be at the center of the transformation? You. You. Union. [Applause] Noworking people in this country.
In 10 years, America is going to look around and say: ""My God, look what we did. Look at the nation's roads, bridges, airports, at all theall the investments."" Andwho do you think they're going to give credit for? You, because you were the
Audience member. Yeah!
The President. No, because you were the ones that will have done it. You'reyou're going to lead the world in manufacturing of semiconductor chips. Who's going to build those fabs? Who's going to workwho's going to work in them? Union members are going to do that.
A huge[applause]. A huge number of jobs we're creating won't require a college degree, but they'll pay above $100,000 a year. Who's going to get these jobs? Working folks.
We're doing something right now no one has thought possible. We're on the edge of a manufacturing boom in America. For the longest time, we've been told to give up on American manufacturing. I was told you can't do it here anymore. Well, I never believed it. And this Nation used to lead the world in manufacturing, and we're going to do it again.
Audience member. Thanks, Joe! [Applause]
The President. No, I promise you.
People studying this right now are astonished at what's going on, a boom they never saw coming. Well, we're going to show them. Who do you think is going to get stamping these products ""Made in America""? You are. You are.
But the Republicans don't like this anymore. Most of them opposed everything I've done and most want to get rid of it all. So we've got a fight on our hands.
And my question to you is simple: Are you with me in this fight?
Let me tell you something
Audience members. Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe!
The President. Because let me tell you something: If Republicans come after what I've done, when they come back to try to get rid of all these clean energy investments and they try to stop the plan on infrastructure, when they try to do these things, guess what? They're coming for your jobs. They're coming for your jobs.
They're coming for your future. They're coming for the future we're building for your kids and your grandkids. And when they come back, as they did just this past week, with their trickle-down economic plan to cut taxes for the rich, who don't thinkwho do you think they're carrying the water for?
They're tryingthey've introduced a bill again to reinstate the $2 trillion tax cut of the80 percent of which goes to the top 1 percent.
Who do you think is going to start carrying the burden?
Audience member. We are.
The President. You are. No, you are. That's the God's truth. Working people in this country.
Look, we've got a better answer. It's time for everyoneI mean everyone, no matter how rich or powerful they areto start paying their fair share. You've carried the country on your back. You've carried long enough.
It's time for millionaires and billionaires and big corporations to pay their fair share. I can get that done, but I need you badly. So are you with me?
Look, I've been at this a long time. I've been at this a long time. I can honestly say I've never been more optimistic about America's future.
I know a lot of peopleit's hard to believe, but not for me, because I know the people of this country. We just have to remember who we are. We're the United States of America. There's nothingnothing, nothingbeyond our capacity. Nothing beyond our capacity when we do it together.
Audience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!
The President. God bless you all. May God protect our troops. Keep the faith.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2023-06-16 00:00:00,"Remarks at the National Safer Communities Summit in West Hartford, Connecticut","
The President. Hello, hello, hello.
Audience members. Hello!
The President. I think maybe your patience exceeds your good judgment. [Laughter] Please, have a seat, if you have one.
Thank you for your commitment. I really mean it.
You know, as a kid, I came out of a different movement, the civil rights movement. Senator Blumenthal and I have talked about it before. I come from a State that has the eighth largest Black population in the country and was segregated when I was a kid. That's what got me engaged. And it made me believe that we could do anything. Made me believe we could do anything.
So I want to thank Chris for the introduction.
But before I say anything else, I want to acknowledge the amazing young people we just heard from. You know[applause]I really mean it.
It takes extraordinary courage for them to stand up here and retell the story. Because many of you out thereeither parents, relatives, and/or victims yourselfit's not just your story, it's the first graders, the educators of Sandy Hook. It's the kids and teachers at Uvalde who I sat with afterwards. It's the EmanuelMother Emanuel, 8 years ago tomorrow. It's the Tree of Life Synagogue. It's the families all across Hartford.
Not just the shootings that make the headlines, but every single dayevery damn day in Americain thein areas that are poor, mostly minority, there's a mass shooting. And it never reaches the crescendo that it reaches other places. Every single day.
And, folks[applause]. Folks, there's athere's a lota lot we have to do. And it takes courage to tell the story that you've been through, because, you know, I spent a lot of time as President, and I spent 30-some timesvisitsmany more days in Afghanistan and Iraq. And I watch. You know, we have posttraumatic stress, they call it, for soldiers. What's the difference between the posttraumatic stress that a soldier meets in the hills of Afghanistan and a 4-yeara fourth-grade kid meets in a classroom when they have to duck and cover? No, I'm serious.
And you're here, many of you, and it brings it all back. Brings it all back for your families, your parents, your siblings. And it brings it back for the entire country. It ripples through the Nation.
I don't know how many times I met with people at events in the country who shake my hand and say: ""I'm worried. There's been another shooting not far from where I live. I'm scared to send my kid to school."" It's had a profound impact.
And some people in this room have turned your pain into purposeI suspect all of you haveyour loss into determination; and your angerjustifiable angerinto a deep-seated commitment. You're the reason why I'm so optimistic about the future of this country. And that's not hyperbole, that's a fact. You're the best educated, most involved, least selfish, and most consequential generation in American history.
I'm also optimistic because of leaders like Senator Murphy. Chris, thanks for inviting me today to organizeand for organizing this summit. You know, Chris and I have known each other a long time and grew closer after that December day in 2012. You just elected to the Senate, and Barack and I had just been reelected to the White House, when the soul of Newtown, the soul of Connecticut, the soul of the Nation was pierced forever.
You've never forgotten that feeling, and you've never given up on something that can neverwe can never loseever lose: hope. Hope.
The same goes for Senator Dick Blumenthal, a great friend. He was attorney general when my deceased son was attorney general of Delaware. Another leader in the fight against gun violence.
And Governor Lamont and Connecticut delegation, which is incredibleI think on this issue and many others, you're the best delegation in the United States of America. [Applause] No, Ithat's the truth.
I also want to acknowledge the gentlelady from Georgia, Lucy McBath. Lucy carries her son Jordan in her heart. She proves you can run for office on ending gun violence in the South and you can win. Only by about 20 points or something like that. I've never come close. [Laughter] Lucy, I know this isn't easy for you. You'veyou're a real pro. But I know it's not easy for you. I remember.
And one of Jill's favorite people in the whole world, and mineI always introduce her asshe isMark Kelly is her husband. [Laughter] Ladies and gentlemen, Gabby Giffords. She's a[applause]Gabby has more courage than most people I have ever known.
I had the honor to bestow the Presidential Medal of Freedom on Gabby, not only for her courage, but her intellect that helped carry this movement. She's not stopping now. She's not stopping now. Gabby, I love you. You're wonderful.
And, Congressman Larson, thanks for the passport into your district. You've never given up. You've never given up either.
And to the State and local leaders, the mayor, othersthe dedication to this vital issue is critical. It really is.
Look, you know, to the survivors and families, Jill and Iand Jillmy wife, Jill, is not here today with me. She is in Delaware right now. She had to go back up.
Jill and I have gotten to know many of you over the years. Some of us have become friends for a long time. We've kept in touch. Mark, it's good to see you again and your family.
And losses may be different circumstances, but we've shared before something that's helped our family. When my wife and daughter were killed when a tractor trailer struck them andjust after I got electedmy two boys weren't expected to live.
And then later, when my son Beau, who was the attorney general and spent a yearvolunteered to spend a year in Iraq, died of stage 4 glioblastoma, my daughter Ashley tappedtaped a mirrorexcuse mea message to the mirror. The way we get toeverything gets to me through my wife and daughter now is athey know I have to shave in the morning[laughter]so they'll tape on the mirrorfor realso I can see it when I'm shaving.
And one day, she left me a quote from Immanuel Kant, who wrote that finding happiness and peace of mind when it seems impossible can be done. He said, ""You need something to do, someone to love, and something to hope for.""
""Something to do"" was to fulfill the promise I made to my son Beau and to my familyand your families, and you've made toothat I would not retreat from public life in the sadness that I felt afterwards, that I'd stay engaged to solve problems. ""Someone to love""my family, my kids, my grandkids. And ""something to hope for""all of you, survivors and advocates, who have built real movement with something to hope for. Something to hope for.
That your collective trauma and injuries are not going to be in vain. That your friend, your family member, your loved one did not die in vain. That by acting in their memory, you can prevent the next tragedy, you can save life, you can save families. In the process, you can continue to save the country. And I mean that.
Look, folks, a year ago, the conventional wisdom was, we would never get any Republicans to support gun legislation, period. That was the conventional wisdom. And all the usual obstacles would block us once again. But it didn't happen.
Instead, I signed into law the Bipartisan Safer Community Act, which you've referenced several times today, which many have described was the most significant gun safety law in 30 years. And it is.
But for me, and for most of you, here's what it really is: It's an important first step. I know it feels like it isn't enough when you turn on the news and see another tragedy at a school, a grocery store, a parade, or a place in Americahonestly, I feel like that as well.
The facts give us reason to hope though. So far this year, murder is down in many major cities across the country. There's far too much gun violence, but that's why this summit is so important and why Chris asked me to be here today with the following message.
One year ago, we did come together. We did hear the call for too many families. Every one of those families I've met at all the places I've mentioned, I was there formet with every single family. And you know what they'd say? Almost the same phrase, Dick. They'd say, ""Do something."" ""Do something."" And the response usually was, ""My prayers are with you.""
Well, prayers are fine. They're important that it doesn't happen again. But it's not going to stop it. We have to take action. We have to move, have to do something.
And so what happened? We began to continue to fight again, because for a while there, there were only about two dozen of usin the Congress or as Vice President or when I wasas Presidentwho thought anything could be done.
We did pass the most meaningful gun safety law in 30 years. We did overcome an unrelenting opposition of the gun lobby to gun manufacturers and so many politicians who hide behind the belief that they'll never have to pay a price for their inaction when they oppose commonsense gun legislation. And we beat them. We beat them.
And we did it through a bipartisan effort that included a majority of responsible gun owners. Because whether you're Democrats or Republicans, we all want families to be safe. We all want to drop them off at the house of worship, a mall, a movie, the school door without worrying that's the last time we're ever going to see them.
We all want our kids to have the freedom to learn to read and to write instead of learning how to duck and cover in a classroom. And above all, we all agree: We are not finished. We are not finished. We are not finished.
Look, I know you've had a full day of summit, getting into details of the law. But, folks listening at home, here's a quick summary of what'swhat the law is doing. It's already allowing the Justice Department, through the FBI, to run enhanced background checks on young people under 21 trying to buy a firearm.
This legislation has already provided more than $230 million for States to expand the use of tools like the ""red flag"" lawsas my son was the first to enforce when he was attorney generalwhich says that a court has a right to temporarily movetemporarily remove a firearm where there's danger to themselves or others.
More people die from gun violence as a consequence of suicide than anything else that happens in the Nation. Suicide. This legislation has already delivered more than $1.5 billion to States and communities to make schools safer, improve access to mental health services, and help young people deal with the grief and trauma resulting from gun violence, posttraumatic stress syndrome.
It includes an additional 14,000 mental health professionals hired and trained to work at our schools.
The law helps prevent domestic abusers from purchasing guns. I'm the guy that wrote the Violence Against Women Act. I proposed a long time ago[applause]I didn't mean toI didn't say it for that reason. But I care deeply about it, because the ultimate abuse: the abuse of power. My dad used to say, ""The single worst abuse of all was the abuse of power.""
We fought like hell to close the so-called ""boyfriend loophole."" If in fact you had a stay-away order issued against a man or a woman because of your boyfriend or girlfriend and they weren't your spouse, then guess what? They decidedthe last administration decided not to impose this limitation on being able to own a weapon.
So we finally can say that those convicted of domestic violence abuse against their girlfriend or boyfriend cannot buy a firearm, period. And by the way, it's already saving lives. There are fewer deaths occurring in that area.
For the first time ever, we explicitly made gun trafficking a Federal crime. They say: ""What the hell? It wasn't already?"" [Laughter] No, I'm serious. Think about it.
You go home and tell your mother, father, brother, sister, aunt, and uncle that, ""Whoa, gun trafficking is now a crime."" They're going to look at you like: ""What are you talking about? It's always been a crime."" It wasn't a crime.
We did the same thing for straw purchases. That's when a middleman, who can pass the background check, buys a gun usually for someone who can't pass the background check. It's now a Federal crime if you do that.
And finallywe finally clarified who needs to register as a Federal licensed gun dealer, because a federally licensed gun dealer is required by law to run background checks on those he's selling the weapon to. And in most citiesdown in Philadelphia and New York, areas I know welllike up hereyou'd see a truck pull up, pull to the curb, and selling weaponsselling guns, selling AR-15. Selling weapons. Well, guess what? You do that now, you go to jail.
There's so much more, but the bottom line: If this law had been in place a year ago, lives would have been saved. And it's in place now, and it is saving lives today. We got it done because of you. Not a joke.
You all think we're being nice to you. It's[laughter]. You're tough. [Laughter] Thank God. But Ibut I really mean it. It's because of you. Moms Demand Action. Big deal. All theall the[applause]. No, I really mean it.
Because what did you do when young people are coming out, people who you grew up with who didn't think this was real; the suburbanite Republican man or womanor Democrat, not just Republicanin thewho thinks, well, you know, everything is fine, and then all of a sudden they see someone of your caliber, someone of your commitment, walking down the street saying, ""We've got to do something."" It matters. It matters, it matters, it matters. And you can feel it; you can taste it, what you're doing.
And here's the deal: You're changing the culture, proving we can do more than just thoughts and prayers. You're changing our politics. You're registering voters, you're recruiting candidates, you're getting them elected. You've proven that you're powerful and you're relentless. And it matters. It matters. They know you're not going away.
As I just said when I signed the law: a call to action to do more. Because I don't see that this was enough; neither do you. Really important. Really, if nothing else happened, we have changed things for the better.
So I set out to take as much executive actionthat's a fancy word of saying: What can I do as President on my own? [Laughter] Executive action that made it illegal to manufacture so-called ""ghost guns."" I just signed that, and I said that.
It's being challenged in court, but so far, it matters. That allow anyone to assemble a gun at home, bought from several different places, in as little as 30 minutes. Come on. These weapons don't have serial numbers. That's why they like to buy them, so criminals can use them to commit crimes and not leave behind a registration of who owned the weapon.
It made it harder for people to buy stabilized braces. Put a pistol on a brace, and it makesturns into a gun. Makes them where you can have a higher caliber weapona higher caliber bullet coming out of that gun. It's essentially turning it into a short-barreled rifle, which has been a weapon of choice by a number of mass shooters.
We're making it easier to buy gun locks and other safe storage at gun stores.
If any one of you drove over the parking lot here today, got out of your car, and left a key in your car, and a kid comes along who's 13, 14 years old, gets in your car, takes it on a joyride and kills someone, guess what: You're liable.
Why should that not be the case if you don't lock up your weapon? Why should that not be the case? Why is that not required? And most gun owners agree with me.
We also established a zero-tolerance policy for rogue gun dealers who willfully violate the law. Now, instead of a slap on the wrist, their licenses are revoked.
You have a lot of gun dealers who are engaged in shady actions. Well, guess what? Used to be, they getthey'd get a fine. Now they lose their license to sell. We established a strike force to crack down on gun trafficking across State lines, including guns brought up from Georgia, South Carolina, Washington, Philadelphia, New York, right here to Hartford.
All told, we've taken more executive action to reduce gun violence than any of my predecessorsprobably than all my predecessors. They're being challenged in court, but so far, so good. [Laughter]
And the budget I submitted to Congress would help reduce crime by increasing funding to go after gun traffickers. And for theby the wayyou know what I get when Iwe're talking about the fentanyl at the border and all that? I speak with the President of Mexico. ""Will you stop sending guns to us?"" We are sending dangerous weapons, particularly assault weapons, to Mexico. To Mexico. They're asking us: ""Please stop it. Cut it off at the border.""
What in God's name are we becoming if we don't do this?
Look, ladies and gentlemen, for those who say they're concerned about crime, you can't deal with crime without dealing with gun violence. It's a simple proposition.
Remember, for a long time in America, car accidents were the leading killer of children. This was mentioned earlier. Then, in 2020, guns became the number-one killer of children in America. Guns. More than car accidents, more than cancer. Let me say that again: We can't let that just become another statistic. Guns, the number-one killer of children in the United States of America?
Folks, it's time once again that we banned AR-15 rifle-style weapons, high-capacity magazines; they're not only a weapon of war, they're the single biggest driver of profits for the gun industry. That's why they're selling them. Profit, profit, profit. The single biggest.
As I said, we did it once before, in '94, and 10 years after that, the ban wasmass shootings went down significantlythe number of mass shootings. That'swhen the ban expired, mass shootings tripled. But let the ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines come back into vogue.
Look, I find it outrageous that of all the industries in Americaand by the way, I've been doing this a long time. [Laughter] I know I don't look that old. I know. [Laughter] I'm a little under 103. [Laughter]
But all kidding aside, I thoughtI mean, I'm going to say something outrageous. I was a pretty powerful Senator. Iprettymanaged some of the biggest committees: judiciary, foreign policy, et cetera. But I didn't know 10 years agoI didn't know that there aregun manufacturers are immune from liability. I didn't know that. Gun manufacturers.
Just imagine how many more people would be dead if the tobacco industryif the tobacco industry was immune from liability, you couldn't sue the tobacco industry. I'm being deadly earnest. Think about the number of people who would be dead today that are alive because we could sue them and they paid billions of dollars for theirfor the damage they were doing.
Well, ladies, we need to end immunity for the gun manufacturers. We've got to hold them accountable. And it's time we establish universal background checks and require safe storage of firearms.
And just remember, the United States of America has the finest fighting force in the history of the world. We provide ourthese same servicemembers with the most lethal weapons on Earth. But we also require them to receive significant training before they are allowed to use them.
We require extensive background checks and mental health assessment on them before they can allow to use them. We require them to lock them up and store the weapons responsibly or they're court-martialed and put in jug.
These are commonsense requirements all gun owners should follow. Every gun owner should be required to have the same requirements held to him or her. We know what to do.
Congress needs to act. And let me be clear about something: If this Congress refuses to act, we need a new Congress.
And we need States to act as well. Not everynot every State has a Governor as competent as Governor Lamont, and I mean that. But they can do a lot more. Look what the Gov has done here in this State.
Less than 2 weeks ago here in Connecticut, Governor Lamont signed a bipartisan legislation with more than a dozen measures to improve gun safety, from providing open carry and strengtheningfrom prohibiting open carry and strengthening the ban on assault weapons and ghost guns.
Illinois, Washington State passed assault weapons bans this year, bringing the total to 10 States and the District of Columbia. Michigan, Minnesota, Colorado, Vermont passed legislation establishing or strengthening the ""red flag"" laws. Now, 21 States plus the District of Columbia have ""red flag"" laws in effect. Since 2021, seven States have passed an increase in accountability for gunfor the gun industry.
I said, beginningat the beginning, youthey've turned their pain into purpose. You turned your cause into reality.
I believe we've reached a tipping point in this Nation. I really do. Swear to God. People in this room are the big reason why we reached that tipping point. As Senator Murphy says, ""Success begets success."" But the converse is also true: Failure begets failure. That's why Jill and I, Kamala, and the entire administration are more determined than ever that you should be successful as well.
Look, let me close with this. I know many people here who have been impacted by gun violence, lost someone they loved, fought so hard for so many years. A lot of you are tired.
Audience member. Yes, sir! [Inaudible]
The President. You're tired. No, II
Audience member. Yes, sir!
The President. I get it. Try being 110 and doing it again. [Laughter]
All kidding aside, a lot of people are frustrated. My mother, God love herall 5-foot-1Catherine Eugenia Finneganshe'd look at me and say: ""Joey, never bow. Never bend. Never yield. Never kneel."" We never will on this issue. Never, never, never, never, never. [Applause]. Until we have a rational policy.
Folks, are we ever going to make progress we need to make? I'm here to tell you we cannot give up. We will not get thereI still remember the people I met with in Newtown, in Orlando, in Las Vegas, in Pittsburgh, in Charleston, Parkland, El Paso, Uvalde, Buffalo, Monterey Park, and so many other places that never make the headlines.
I've never forgotten them, and I never will forget them. And I'll never stop fighting for them. I promise you. And I believe this is true: that everyone in this room, you'll never stop fighting for them as well.
We will ban assault weapons in this country. We will ban multiround magazines. We will hold gunmakers liable. We will beat the gun industry. We will beat big money that sits behind them and the politicians who refuse to stand up and act.
It won't be easy. I have no illusions how fiercely they'll fight back, but I also have no illusions about the people in this room.
Look at what you've already done here in Connecticut and around the country. Look at the movement you've built. Look at the people you've helped elect. Look at the progress you've made in statehouses. Look at all the mothers organizing all across the country.
Listen to the young people who've spoken out here today. They're speaking for a whole generation, and they will not be ignored. They will not be shunned. They will not be silent in this moment.
In this moment, we have to remember whatI got to know himNelson Mandelawhen I tried to get to Africato South Africa to meet him. And he came back, and he met me when he was finally freed. He met me at the White House. And he looked at me, and I swear to Godit wasn't unique to me, I'm surehe said, ""It always seems impossible until it gets done.""
There's nothing beyond our capacity. That's the power of memory of your loved one. That's the power of this movement. That's the power of America. Our lives and the lives of our Nation find purpose: something to do, someone to love, something to hope for. We have just to keep going and keep the faith.
Every time I'd walk out of my Grandpop Finnegan's house up in Scranton, he'd yell, ""Joey, keep the faith."" My grandmother would yell, ""No, Joey, spread it.""
Remember who we are. We're the United States of America. And there's nothing beyond our capacity when we do it together.
God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.
We can get this done. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I mean it. Thank you.
Now, as yousome of you know, I'd usually come down and say hi to all of you. They tell me there's a storm coming in. Is that right? It's stillis that still the deal?
Audience members. Nooo!
The President. If that's the truth, now, don't make a lie[laughter]. As thatas that scene in the John Wayne movie, ""Don't make me a dog-faced, lying pony soldier."" [Laughter]
All right, well, I tell you what, here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to ask the White House photographer to come up. And what I'm going to do is, I'm going to standI can'tI usually shake everybody's hand. But I'm going to stand in front of each section. No, I really mean it. And thenand if you can see the camera, they can see you. And it's the least consequential part of this whole meeting for you, I promise.
All right? God save the Queen, man.

2023-06-16 00:00:00,"Remarks at a Campaign Fundraiser in Greenwich, Connecticut","
The President. Please, have a seat. First of all, Stephen, sir, thank you very, very much for the hospitality. Just what you all need to do in early June, with graduations going on: show up, have to get dressed on a Friday, then maybe even Saturday. Who knows. [Laughter] Anywayand I want to thank all my colleagues from the Senate and the House, and the Governor.
I think you haveand I mean this sincerelyI think you have the most consequential delegation in the United States Congress. I really mean it. And you've got a Governor who is really first rate. They know it, and they know what they do. They know how to get things done. And they've been great, great allies.
And, folks, everyone herewe wouldn't beI wouldn't be here, standing here as President of the United States, without a lot of you in this room. You'veI never raised a lot of money when I was running before, whether I was Vice President or whether I was a Senator oryou know, I wasI did all right.
But this last time out, many of youI raised more money than I think anybody has ever raised in small contributions as wellI mean, literally millions of dollars. And it allowed me to be able to say what I thought, do what I thought was the right thing to do, and be straightforward about it.
So thank you. It makes a gigantic difference.
[At this point, the President checked the hand-held microphone.]
Is this thing working or should I put it down?
Audience member. It's working.
The President. It's working.
Well, look, so far, so good, in terms of thejust a few facts and then maybe we can just mingle, and you can ask me whatever you want, talk about anything you want to talk about.
You know, I've met with a lot of world leaders. My background going into this job, I guess, was mostly constitutional issues and foreign policy. And I've met the vast majority of the heads of state in the past. And when I was Vice President, that was my job. When I was Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman, it's what I spent most of my time doing.
And there were two objectives I had. You may recall when I announced for President last timewhen you were helping me, many of youI indicated that I thought there were three things that had to be done.
One, we had to restore the soul of this Nationthe sense of decency, honor; some sense of constitutional, institutional structureagain. We had sort ofwe had, I think, devolved to a point where we hadn't been in a long, long, long time.
And soand I said, ""So I want to restore the soul of the country, number one."" Number two, I wanted to build the economy from the middle up, the bottom up. Because when that happens, the wealthy do very well and everybody has a shot. And in the trickle-down economy, not a lot trickled down to my pop'smy dad's kitchen table. Butand, number three, I said I wantedand I got legitimately and understandably criticizedI said I wanted to unite the country. Because in a democracy, we can't function if we can't unite. We need consensus in order to run this great country by the very nature of our institutions and our structure.
And so that's what we set out to do. With your help, we'veI think we've gotten a lot of it done.
For example, with regard to restoring the sense of decency and honor, people areit's notnot gottenit's not as vitriolicwith notable exceptionsas it has been. I think things are moving a little. I think people thought when wewhen we took on the very hard-right members of the House of Representatives dealing with the debt ceiling, I think people were surprisedsurprised that we were able to pull together enough people on both sides to come up with a rational and a serious budget proposal.
My first 2 years, I reduced the debtmy administration reduced thethe debt by $1.7 trillionmore than any President has in American historyin the first 2 years. We've created over 13 million 400 thousandI think it's 13-450 million jobsmore than any President has in the first 4 years of any administration. And it's not aboutit's about giving people a shotgiving people an even shot.
We also put ourselves in a position where we have done more on the environment, I think, thanI think it's fair to saythan any President ever has. And the reason I say that is because we're in a situation where, if you'reI'magain, I was warned not to make a20-minute speech here, so I'm not going to do that. But I want to just give you a few, as they used to say, factoids.
Number one, we were able to pass and maintainkeep in play, no matter what the other team tried to take away$369 billion in environmental money for the environment.
Of that, we've reduced by the year 2030, we're going to reduce 50 to 52 percent of all emissionsall emissions. We're in a situation where thewe're in a situation where we're going to move in a direction that, by 2030, we're going to have 75 percent of all the energy we produce renewable energy. By the year thirty2035, the United States is on path to do 100-percent renewable energy.
We'reconservationwe've conserved more land and water than any administration has in American history. We've conserved the mostfor example, in Alaska alone, we've been able to preserve and make sure the 9excuse me, 9 million acres. In Minnesota, the Boundary Waters, 250 millionthousand acres.
Theyou knowanyway, I won't go through it all, but we've done a great deal. Wefor example, one of the things I tried very hard to doand everybody was saying we couldn't do anything in a bipartisan wayis not just the partisan side, but the traditionalhow can Inot enemies, but adversaries.
Onea lot of people thought in the very beginning, when I didn't announce my green plan, that somehow I was backing off of what I had said before. Well, what I was doing was meeting with the auto industry and the autoworkers and the laborers to convince them that it's overwhelmingly in their interest to support these environmental changes.
Well, to make a quick analogypoint, thistomorrow, I'm going up to Philadelphia to have every major labor union in the country endorse meevery one. And yesterday every major environmental group endorsed meevery single one.
Because we figured out it's in the mutual interest. The jobs lie in the future. The jobsnot on all thethat doesn't mean we're not going to need some oil and gas andfor a while. But it does mean that we're going tomake a fundamental shift.
Andfor example, when I go to these COP meetingsthesethese meetings relating to international efforts to deal with the environment worldwide, whether it was in Cairo or thewherever it is. And guess what? We're now on a path that we're going to be able to take outwe got agreement last time out with all the major countriesover 100 countriesthat they will deal with whatthey're referred to as those really terribleterrible, terriblehow can I say it?just everything from methane to all the worst of all chemicals going into the air.
Well, you know, we've got aI proposed at one of those meetings with thethe sixthere are seven major nations in the world economiesthat we all agree to get rid of methane by the year 20well, we're moving that way. Methane is four, five, six times more damaging to the environment than, for example, just greenhouse gases. And we talk about it all the time.
We areyou know, we're in a position where we have 50 factories now in America making electric batteries and increasing the production. We're not where China is now, but we're making significant progress.
We havewe're going to have twice as many charging stations as when I began. And by the yearby the time we finish the transition to electric vehicles, we're building 500 thousand500,000 charging stations nationwide so you can go across the country like you couldevery gas station you needed was available to you. Well, same thing here.
And one of the things that I thinkand I'm going to end hereis that I've tried to bring together traditional adversaries because I think the world has changed.
There's a famous poet namedand I was quoting Irish poets, and my colleagues would always kid me because they say I'm doing it because I'm Irish. That's not the reason. I do it because they're the best poets in the world. [Laughter]
But Seamus Heaney, who'sI mean, he's passed away, but I'm friends with his wifehe wrote a poem called ""The Cure of Troy."" And there was a sentence, and he says, ""All is changed""""All is changed, changed utterly. A terrible beauty has been born.""
Well, a terrible beauty has been born. We have an opportunity to make significant progress off of it. The idea that finallyI don't hearif I were here in this living room with your friends 3 years ago, you would have had a lot of friends who would say they doubted whether there was a real environmental crisis, that there really was a serious problem.
Do you know many people saying that these days? They may say ""In my interest, I don't want to do that."" But do you know anybody who says there's not an environmental crisis?
There was an article in the New York Times three Mondays, ago; there was one again, I think, 4 days agopointing out where the State of TexasState of Texas has more solar and wind energy. I think it's 70 percent of all their energy produced by solar and wind because it is significantly cheaper. Cheaper. Cheaper. Not just because it isit is environmentally moremore friendly, but it's cheaper.
And guess what they're doing? The legislature is trying to get rid of it because they want to do the bidding of the oil companies. We're going to need oil for a while. We're going to need gas. We're going tobut nothing like we consume now. Nothing.
But it's working, and that's bothered some people that it's working.
But the other point I want to make is that it's the same way in bringing together the world. And I'll end with this.
I get both credit and blame for keeping NATO united. The fact is that when Iwe supported Ukraine, and all my colleagues in here did as well. We supported Ukraine. The concern was because wePutin was certainand I've known him for 28 years, almost 30 years, only having met with himlast time I met with him for any period of time was 2 years ago in Geneva. But I know him.
And he was confidentconfidentthat he could break the West; we would not stay together because NATO had never beenhadwas having some serious rifts internally about what to do in Europe. Well, guess what? Ask any NATO leader. NATO is more united today than it has been any time in the history of NATOin the history of NATO. That's good for America.
And by the way, when I went and told people that we'reI was going to bring Japan alongwhen's the last time Japan would have an interest in seeing what peace in Europe and supply[laughter]no, I'm serious. Think about it. Well, guess what? Became close friendI used to always kid Barack, as the Governor knows. And we'dI met with him every morning at 9 o'clock for 8 years when I was Vice President. And I'd start off and sayhe'd start talking, and I would say, ""All politics is personal, Barack.""
It's personal with heads of state. It's personal withwith dealing with colleagues. It's personal. And you have to build trust.
Well, now you haveyou have Japan significantly increasing their defense budget; Japan supporting Ukraine in Europe because he knows that there's no such thing as a major war in Europe that will not affect all the world.
You have him finally makingwhich no one believed, but when I talked to him at length about why he had to get together with South Korea and settle a 50-year difference they had about womenthe way they were treating womenwell, they've worked it out. They're now dealing with one another.
The point is that these moments of change, I think we have opportunities to not only change the direction but to change the order of things in ways that are better for the moment.
I'll end with this. Thehow can I say? Before I decided to run in 2020and I had decided not to run initially, until we saw what happened down in Charlottesville, Virginia. And that young woman was killed. And the former President was asked, ""What do you think?"" Said there were good people on both sides.
Well, you know, not figuratively, literally, my grandchildren asked for mewe have a tradition in my family, for realit's only been exercised about 10 times since I've been alivewhere any child can ask for a family meeting. And it's taken seriously. Not a joke. And you can have a family meeting to discuss what'sand if the family wants, they[inaudible].
And so I got a call from my daughterwas in her last year at Columbia Law Schoolmy granddaughter. And I got a call from my number two granddaughter, who was a senior at Penn at that time. And then I had one who was a junior. Anyway. I have four granddaughters and a grandson.
And they all came to me. That wasgot the call on Thursday; we met on Saturday. And they saidbecause they knew I was thinking of running, but I knew it was going to be an ugly campaign. And I didn'twonder whether I wanted to put the family through that again.
And they said, ""Pop""they started at age; the oldest one spoke first. And now we said, ""Pop""named after my deceased daughterI saidsaid: ""Pop, you know Dad wants you to run. Will youyou've got to run. You've got to do it."" And they all went down their reasons.
And I got to my grandson. My wife doesn't like me telling this part, but I think it's important. My little grandson, who was then a sophomorein eighth grade, almost going into ninth, and he took outhe said, ""We know it's going to be tough, Pop.""
And the reasonyou know, I mean, think about it: Their entire life, their grandfather is either Senator, Vice President and/orwell, Senator at that time or Vice President, and their dad had been attorney general. And so their whole life, theythey understood the politics, just like if you'reInever knew what the hell a mortgage was. If my dad were a banker, I would have known was a mortgage was when I was 9 years old. [Laughter]
So he took out his cell phone. He said, ""We know it's going to be ugly, Pop."" And there was a photograph online. There was a picture that was online put out by someonewho did it, I didn't even lookof me walking out of the church with a military cord on, carrying my dead son with the American flag on it and my hand on the flag, and then my hand on my little grandson around his chin. And the headlinethe chyron at the bottom said, ""Biden molests another child."" Said, ""We know it's going to be ugly, Pop.""
Well, the truth is, I think the American people are a lot better than we give them credit for. I think they're focusing. I think they're looking hard. I think they're deciding what they have to do.
And I think that's going to crossacross the board. We hear these numbers about so many people are not going to move. I think people areare looking for it. I think they sense there's real opportunity. But they don't know exactly what it is yet.
And that's my responsibility. Everything we passedwe've done polling on since it's passedit's overwhelmingly popular. It's overwhelmingly. The CHIPS and Science Act, which created literally $300 billion in direct investment, creating tens of thousands of jobs.
We're in a situation where there's a trillion two hundred billion dollars inmoney for new environmental, notexcuse me, not just environment, inindustrial capacity. How canhow can you be the most powerful and successful nation in the world with a second rate infrastructure?
We used to be number 1 in the world; we're now number 14 in the world. There's thingsand this creates jobs, and it changes the environment and changes people's attitudes.
And so there's a lot we've done. And I think we just got to let many people know we've done it and be straight with people. Just be as straight as we can about what we've done and what we haven't done.
And one of the things I decided to do wasthis time out, when I ran last timewas to say what I thought was on my mind, because there wasn't anything worth anymore tojust to keep the job.
No, II mean, it sincerely. There's nothing noble about it. I've just been doing this so damn long, I'm not going to[laughter]but for real.
And I think that's how your delegation is, by the way. I think when push comes to shove, they'd rather sayrather than move on something they don't believe, to say ""no"" and take the risk of losing. Because I think we underestimate that people reward political courage. They reward courage.
And so I think that one ofyou know, and we have four or five major issues in this campaign, from what's happening to freedom, women's right to choose, what we're doing in freedom in education, freedomI mean, did you ever think you'd go through a time when the number-two contender on another team was banning books?
I mean, you knowanyway. I'm talking too much now. [Laughter]
So, anyway, I can't tell you how much I appreciate your help. Any questions you have for me, anything you want to talk about, I'm happy to do it. I'll give it to you straight.
Andbut I really am optimistic about America's prospects, not because of me, and I mean that sincerely, but because we have a new generation of young peopleyoung people who are the best educated, the most decent, the most engaged, the most involved generation in American history. That's why I'm optimistic, for real.
And think of the periods of time and these inflection points where the decisions made in a 4-, 5-, 6-, 7-year period set theset the stage for what the next four or five decades are going to look like.
Well, the post-war period is over. We're in a different world. And we have gigantic opportunities, and we just have to have the courage and remember: This is the United States of America. There is nothing, nothing, nothing beyond our capacity when we decide to work together. I mean it. I believe that with every fiber of my being.
I can't think of a single thing we've ever set our mind to do as a nation that we haven't been able to accomplish eventually.
So there's a lot I'm hopeful for that 2-year-old. I'm hopeful for that 2-year-old, that long before they're 30. Okay? And I'm 34 years old. [Laughter]
Anyway, I'm going to hush up. Thank you for listening, and I'm happy to talk.

2023-05-03 00:00:00,"Remarks at a Dinner for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Combatant Commanders, and Their Spouses","
The President. Again, welcome. And thank you for allall for being here. Folks, this is something we look forward to since we've become President, and we appreciate you all coming.
Just last week, Jill and I had a chance to host another group: the Air Force Academy football team. [Laughter] Now, I notice there's only about a quarter of you cheering. [Laughter]
But these young cadets are just starting out. They had the samebut they had the same sense of pride, they had the same sense of purpose and a passionand you could see it in all of themthe same passion that you all possess. YouI don'tyou probably don't even realize what you exude, your confidence in our capacities.
And I told them that they'd soon be joining a long line of American servicemembers, each a link in a chain of honor. And that's how I think about it, when I think of our son. I think of it as a just a chain of honor. Each one.
Over the years, that chain has grown stronger thanks to the generation of military leaders you've all trained. And 75 years of a desegregated military. Seventy-five years of womenfull integration. Fifty years of an All-Volunteer force. And that's hard to believe, because I remember most of that. [Laughter] Worrisome. Worrisome.
As I said at the dinner for thewith the Correspondents Dinner, I said, ""You know, when Jimmy Madison wrote thethat amendment in the Constitution, I was there."" [Laughter] And everybody said, ""Yes, he probably was."" I mean[laughter]. But all kidding aside, each one of you over the years, this chain has grown stronger.
And a mark of these milestones, as a consequence, I challenge you to keep strengthening that chain in big and small ways, to keep sharpening our military edge in the field and across the forces, to keep taking on the challenges of today and tomorrow. You know, I mean, when you think about it, there's no questionthere's never been in each our mindsbut there's no question we have the finest military in the history of the worldand that's not hyperbole, that's literally truein the history of the world.
And I think other leaders around the world who don't share the same view as we do are beginning to understand that.
In return, you know, thethe fact is, in return, I promise that I will always, always have your back. And our military women and menand we have sacred obligationand I know I've said it many, many timesto prepare those we send into harm's way and take care of them and their families when they come home, and to care for them in a way that they deserve. And that's a little bit in dispute right now, but I think we'll get that straightened out too, politically.
And I also want to take a moment to acknowledge the impressive leadership in these last few months. You've armed, you've equipped, and you trained a proud and brave Ukrainian army and helped them preserve their liberty and their democracy.
I spent months in the Ukraine prior to all this happening. And I spoke to the Rada andwhen they were having their debates about who among the strongmen would lead.
But I was theI have to admit to you, I was a little bit surprised just how courageous, how amazingly brave not only the military is, but the Ukrainian people. They're just doing an incredible job. And it's because of you.
Your efforts to evacuate our Embassy as well asin SudanAmerican citizensto facilitate that. And the treatment and capabilities and commitments of our Armed Forces helping American people anywhere in the world.
I don'tyou probably don't think about it, but you're just remarkable, remarkable, remarkable group of people. I mean that sincerely.
Except for Milley. I'm not so sure. [Laughter] Butactually, I don't want toI've embarrassed him. I said, ""You know, I'm going to really miss you."" He said, ""I'm not going anywhere yet."" [Laughter] ""Don't get sentimental on me, Biden. I'm from Boston."" [Laughter]
But you know, you continue to take terrorists off the battlefield with precision and professionalism, protecting our Nation and our allies and interests against the enduring threat. And each and every day, you put our Nation in the strongest possible strategic position around the world. And that, again, is not hyperbole; that's a fact.
Not just in moments of crisis, where you deliver as only Americans can, but in the critical day-to-day work strengthening our alliances from NATO to Japan and the Republic of Korea, the Philippines, and Australia. I think the last several years, we've had a pretty good run, in terms of people stepping up and other nations stepping up.
And in anticipation of new threats in areas like the space and cyber and building new partnerships like AUKUS. And you know, taking on the hard missions andthat transcends all our borders. I mean, it's just amazing. From responding from the global pandemic, to addressing historic levels of migration around the world.
In fact, our two combatant commanders, General Cavoli, head of the European Command, and General Langley of the African Command couldn't be with us tonight because they're standing guard right now. They're runningthey're doing their job at a critical place in critical ways. They're at their post, dealing with the war in Europe and a crisis in Sudan.
And as you've heard me say before many timesI apologize for repeating itbut America is atthe world is at an inflection point. I used to have a professor in undergraduate school who said an inflection point is where you're going down a highway at 50 miles an hour and you take an abrupt turn right or left, 10, 12 degrees. You can never get back on the road you were on. And it's happening again.
We're at a place where the decisions we've made in the last few years, in the next 3 or 4 years are going to determine what this world is going to look likenot figuratively, literallythe next three, four, five decades. So there's a great deal at stake. A great deal at stake. And most of it is in your hands. You've shouldered the unique demands that come with these changes.
And you know, together, we face new challenges, complex threats, and you've remained unflinchingunflinchingin your pride, in your purpose, and your passion.
And that includes all the leaders who will be changing out this summer. General Milley, who I really will miss. He's one of the best I think I've ever servedbeen with. General Bergerand the Marines are going to be missing you, pal. And General McConville, Admiral Gilday, General VanHerck, and General Dickinson.
You know, gentlemen, thank you for your service, and thank you from the bottom of our heart. You have our deepest respect and gratitude.
And finally, I want to thank another important group that's here tonight: your spouses and your families. You know, there's thatyou also serve. You also sacrifice. And I mean that sincerely. It's not hyperbole. Theyou also strengthen our Nation.
The British poet John Milton once wrote, ""They also serve who only stand and wait."" When Beau was in Iraq for a yearbefore that, he was in KosovoI'd watch my wife, who'd get up and go to school. She left a little before me. And she'd be standing by the sink, and she'd be mouthing a prayer that the head of the National Guard in Delaware's wife had given her.
Many of you had to wait for that phone call. You wonder what's going on. And you justbut you're there. You're there. You allow it to work. Whether you're a male or female spouse, you're doing something that isyou're serving the country. It wouldn't work without you.
So tonight I'd like you to please join me in raising your glass. I want to make a toast. To our servicemen and their families, to the chain of honor they create, may it continue to grow stronger generation after generation.
Hear, hear.
[At this point, the President offered a toast.]
Audience members. Hear, hear.
The President. God bless America.

Audience member. Thanks, Uncle Joe. [Laughter]
The President. [Laughter] I just asked whether or not prayer was supposed to start at 6 o' clock. [Laughter] It is now5 minutes. This will be the quickest speech I ever made in my entire life. [Laughter] But I'm told it's not aactually has to be at 6. Is that right?
Well, thank you, Doug and Kamala, for being here. And thank you, Ronnie, for sharing your music with us. And, Imam, thank you for that introduction and creating a place of connection and belonging for Muslims here in Washington, DC.
And thank all of you for joining us in the White House. It is the ""people's house,"" for real. It's your house. It's your house. It represents an incredibly diverse contributions ofthat Muslims have made to our Nation as teachers, as engineers, as doctors, lawyers, business owners, Congresswomen, Congressmen.

Folks, look, he remains an inspiration. And there are even Muslim superheroes now, like Mrs. Marvel.

On that note, I want to mention one special guest tonight, a huge superhero fan from Lexington, Massachusetts: Omar Masood. Omar, where are you?
Audience member. Hey, Omar!
The President. There you are, Omar. The owner of theOmar's World of Comics. All right. There you go. You're looking good, man.

We're really proud of you, Omar. Thank you for being here, buddy.
We also have Members of the House of Representatives here. Congresswoman Omar. Where are you, Congresswoman Omar?

And by the way, there are more MuslimsMuslim Americans serving in Congress today than ever in American history. And it's great for democracy. It's great for democracy when Congress looks like America.
I want everyoneof all the elected officials here who serve in city, county, State governments across the Nation, I want to compliment you. Some of you are the first Muslims ever to hold the seats you have. Thank you. And I'm so proud to see this during my time as President of the United States.
Finally, I want to recognize all the members of my administration here today. Thank you for being on the team. Muslim Americans in my administration are working on everything from making sure our veterans get quality health care, to meeting the climate crisis, to representing Americans overseas as members of our diplomatic corps.
You know, I've appointed Muslim Americans to positions all across the Government, including reinstating the Muslim Liaison position in the Office of Public Engagement here in the White House. To everyone who serves in my administration, working hard every day to help the American people on behalf of them: Thank you, thank you, thank you.
You
Audience member. We also have the first Federal judgeMuslim Federal judge. The only one.
The President. Hey, Judge, how are you? [Laughter] I don't know why you wanted the job, man. [Laughter] I appoint all those Federal judges, but you know, thank you for serving. I'm not kidding.
Audience member. [Inaudible]
The President. You want to come and make a speech? [Laughter] Hush up, boy. [Laughter] As my mother would say.
Look, folks, I hope[laughter]you had a blessed Ramadan.
Fasting from dawn to dusk is not easy. No food. No water. Sleep-deprived from late-night prayers, waking up early before dawn. It's a period of testing and sacrifice that brings you closer to others who suffer and strengthens thoseyour resolve to help build a better world. It demands patience and determination.
In that way, it's not so different than we Catholics have Lent. We do it for 40 days, but not nearly as hard as your time. [Laughter] It's a little longer than Ramadan, but we get to eat and drink[laughter]during the day, which makes a big difference, to say the least.
In the end, Ramadan brings you closer to God and to each other, because Ramadan is something you experience together. That's the important piece of it. You support each other through their daily fasts. You show generosity by giving alms to hungry people. You gather with friends and family and for iftars each night.
And then, at the end of the month, you celebrate Eid with new clothes[laughter]brightly decorated homes, delicious sweets, which I'm waiting for. [Laughter]
All told, Ramadan is a time to slow down, reconnect, and remember what matters most. And even after Ramadan is over, you carry thethose lessons for the rest of the year.
At this point, we look ahead to the work that remains. We remember Muslim communities around the world that are enduring conflict, poverty, hunger, disease, and those that are displaced from their homes. And we recommit to the tireless work of building peace and standing up for the rights and dignity of all people. All people.
And we're determined to confront all forms of hate, including Islamophobia, which is important to me. This is a priority for my administration, which is why I established the interagency Task Force to address attacks on Muslims and anti-Muslim bias and discrimination.
And this was a focus of Unitedthe ""United We Stand"" summit we convened last September. Standing up against anti-Muslim hate is essential to who we are as a country founded on freedom and justice for all.
Let me close with this. Muslims have been part of the United States from the very start. Muslims fought along the patriots during the War for Independence. One of the first countries to recognize the United States as an independent nation was a Muslim country, Morocco.
Today, there are 3.5 million of you in the United States. And you come from different ethnicities, races, speak different languages, but you're united all as Americans. You know, the Quran teaches that, ""One of His [highest] signs is the creation of heavens and earth and the diversity of our languages and colors."" Well, I believe that to be true.
That same idea echoed in the motto of our Nation, ""E Pluribus Unum."" Out of many, one. That's who we are as Americans. We're the most unique country in the world. We're the only country based on not ethnicity, not on race, religion, but based on an idea. An idea that's confident, that's shared by all major faiths. And that is that ""We hold these truths to be self-evident,"" that all men and women are created equal, endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights.
You know, just ask someone who's here with us today, Khizr Khan. Mr. Khan, it's so good to see you, man. It really is.
He studied the U.S. Constitution as a law student in Pakistan; emigrated to America with his wife and their young family, fully believing in the promise of this Nation. They watched their middle son enlist in the United States Army, who, like mine, ultimately sacrificed himself to save, in this casein his casehis fellow soldiers.
In late November of 2016, at a time when the oldest and darkest forces of hate had emerged in new ways, I invited Mr. and Mrs. Khan to the Vice President's Residence in the Naval Observatory for a Diwali reception. Okay?
An Irish Catholic Vice President, a Muslim Gold Star family at a reception observing Hindu holidays. [Laughter] But that's what Americathat's the America we both know.
Last summer, right here in this room, I presented Mr. Khan with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. And he deserved it. That medal rests next to his son's Bronze Star and Purple Heart. And Mr. Khan still carries a copy of the Constitution in his pocket as a reminder of the charge to keep.
Folks, thank youall of youfor your contributions to our Nation, for your patriotism, for your community spirit, for your commitment to the shared values that make us great. And
Boston City Councilor Tania Fernandes Anderson. Mr. President, I'm a mother of a proud U.S. marine. And he just wanted to say hello. And he loves you. [Laughter]
The President. Well, thank you very, very much. [Laughter]
Councilor Anderson. First Muslim to City Council in Boston. We love you.
The President. Well, thank you. [Laughter]
And so I don't get in trouble holding prayer too long[laughter]happy Eid Mubarak.
And God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
So enjoy the evening. And the house is yours. Thank you.

2023-05-01 00:00:00,"Remarks Prior to a Meeting With President Ferdinand R. ""Bonbong"" Marcos, Jr., of the Philippines","
President Biden. Well, Mr. President, welcome back to the White House. We were talking on the way over. It's been a while since you've been here.
President Marcos. Yes, sir.
President Biden. You were withhere with President Reagan, with your father. And we welcome you back.
And you know, when we met in New York last year, you told me that a strong alliance has to continue, quoteI'm using your phrase""to evolve as we face the challenges of this new century."" And we are facing new challenges. And I can't think of any better partner to have than you.
I couldn't agree more that we have to. This relationship has to continue to evolve. And together, we're tackling climate change, we're accelerating our countries' transition to clean energy, and we're standing up for our shared democratic values and workers' rights and the rule of law.
And together, we're deepening our economic cooperation, which is going to continue to deepen and I think is mutually beneficial. And we're going to announce that I'mwe're going to announce today that I'm sending a first-of-its-kind Presidential trade and investment mission to the Philippines. We talked about that very briefly
President Marcos. Yes, sir.
President Biden. up in New York.
And the United States also reminds ironclad in ourremains ironclad in our commitment to the defense of the Philippines, including the South China Sea, and we're going to continue to support the Philippines' military modernization goals.
Mr. President, our countries not only share a strong partnership, we share a deep friendship, one that has been enriched by millions of Filipino Americans in the communities all across the United States of America.
And so I want to thank you again for being here, and I look forward to our conversation today. And I invite you to make any comments you'd like. The floor is yours.
President Marcos. Thank you very much, Mr. President. And Ias you say, in the difficult times that we are facing ahead of us, Iwe need to find many ways to strengthen our alliances and our partnerships in the face of the new economy that we are facing postpandemic.
Beyond that, there isthere are also the issuesgeopolitical issues that have made the region where the Philippines is possibly, arguably the most complicated geopolitical situation in the world right now.
And so it is only natural thatfor the Philippines to look to its sole treaty partner in the world to strengthen and to redefine the relationship that we have and the roles that we play in the face of those rising tensions that we see now around the South China Sea and Asia-Pacific and Indo-Pacific regions.
So I welcome very much the opportunity to come here, to visit with you at the White House, and to discuss all these terribly important issues.
We have many things that are new that need to be assessed and, again, our role as partners in the worldin our worldview of what we are hoping for the future of peace, not only in the Asia-Pacific and Indo-Pacific region, but in the whole world.
So thank you once again for this opportunity, Mr. President.
President Biden. Thank you. And I'm optimistic things will get even better.
President Marcos. Thank you, sir.
President Biden. Thank you.

NOTE: The President spoke at 2:54 p.m. in the Oval Office at the White House.
"
2023-05-01 00:00:00,Remarks Honoring National Small Business Week Award Winners,"
The President. Good morning, or aftergood afternoon. [Laughter]
Sale of First Republic Bank to JPMorgan Chase 
Before we start, I'm pleased to say that the regulators have taken action to facilitate the sale of First Republic Bank and ensure that all depositors are protected and that taxpayers are not on the hook. These actions are going to make sure that the banking system is safe and sound, and that includes protecting small businesses across the country who need to make payroll for workers and their small businesses.
And so let me be very clear: While depositors are being protected, shareholders are losing their investments. And critically, taxpayers are not the ones that are on the hook, as I said earlier.
But going forward, I've called on Congress to give regulators the tools to hold bank executives accountable. And I've called on regulators to strengthen regulations and supervision of large and regional banks.
And, folks, we have to make sure that we're not back in this position again, and I think we're well on our way to be able to make that assurance.
And as I said to my introducer, Jill, a moment ago, she's really impressive, isn't she? And the guy sitting next to her, if you disagree with me, it's her husband, and you're in deep trouble. [Laughter] Welcome, man. Speaking of small business, you've got your own small business. And I want to thank you.
Look, folks, we've got a lot to do. And the most immediate thing we can do is ensure the continued reliance of our economy and the financial system.
Public Debt Limit 
The most important thing we have to do in that regard is to make sure the threat by the Speaker of the House to default on the national debt is off the table.
For over 200 years, America has never, ever, ever failed to pay its debt. To put in the capitalin colloquial terms, America is not a deadbeat nation. We have never, ever failed to meet the debt.
Now, as a result, we're one of the most respected nations in the world. We pay our bills, and we should do so without reckless hostage-taking from some of the MAGA Republicans in Congress.
National Small Business Week Awards 
And, folks, now for the reason we're here: We're all here today because I want to thank Jill and all of youand Jill was last year's winner, as you all knowfor her introduction and for the hope your business gives so many families that so badly need it. They really do.
My daughter is a social worker, working with abused women in Philadelphia, and it's her passion. But there's so much we can do if we just have the wherewithal to reach out.
You know, thanks to Administrator Guzman for leading this historic effort to support small businesses all across America.
And I want to thank Vice President Harris, who's doing such an expanded entrepreneurship [in; White House correction] underserved communities throughout America, talking about what impact it has on those underserved communities.
And congratulations to the National Small Business Week Award winners. You're models of grit, heart, drive, and determination, all the virtuesand it's not hyperbolethat literally built America.
This week, we celebrate that same unstoppable spirit in every entrepreneur nationwide. Small businesses are the engine of our economy, the gluethey really arethe glue, the heart and soul of communities. And most citizens don't know itis that you small-business owners, you account for 40 percentlet me say it again40 percent of the gross domestic product of America. Small businesses. Not mega corporations. Small businesses.
You enjoy nearly halfemploy nearly half of all private-sector workers. And that'sI don't think people know that. I don't think they understand the consequenceeconomic consequence. You're involved in and you're innovative across every single, solitary industry.
You know, we saw it here at the White House last month when I hosted the annual Women's Business Summit to celebrate the critical contributions that women entrepreneurs make to our economy. And we see it here again today in companies likeand I hope I pronounce it rightAmePower? Is it ""Ame""?
Participant. Yes.
The President. I believe that's right, yes. AmePower, Florida's Small Business winneraward winner. Business Week winner. You won. [Laughter] But it's a big deal.
Founded by immigrants from Latin America, it designed high-power energy converters to help fuel our shift to a clean-energy future.
And we see it in businesses like Begin With [Within; White House correction] Therapy, the Illinois winner. Give herlet's clap for that one too. It started 8 years ago in one room in Chicago's South Side and now provides 20,000 mental health care appointments a year, helping change the community for the better.
Every business here has a story. And the Small Business Administration has helped tell those storiesyour storiesand to grow your businesses. And it's one of the best investmentsit's not hyperboleone of the best investments America can make.
That's why supporting small business is at the heart of my plan to grow our economy from the middle out and the bottom up. You know, I came from a working class family, and not a whole lot trickled down. A trickle-down economynot a whole lot dropped on my dad's kitchen table. And so we're building it from the middle out and the bottom up. And I really mean it.
When I took office, our economy was reeling. Small businesses were getting crushed. Hundreds of thousands of smallliterally, hundreds of thousands of small businesses across America had been closed and closed forever. Millions more were hanging by a thread.
Many of you remember that fear of not only losing your livelihood, but losing your dream, your life's savings, your hopes of leaving something behind for your kids.
So we moved fast. Within weeks, we reformed the Paycheck Protection Program to get game-changing help to thousands of small businesses, some right here on this lawn, that had been shut out during the prior administration.
I signed the American Rescue Plan. In sum total, we delivered $450 billion in relief to 6 million small businesses, including many of yours. And by the way, you generated, with your business, more of that in revenue than you got help onwith. You pay your bills, you paid your workers, you kept your doors open. You grew the economy.
We gave additional support to 100,000 restaurants and 220,000 childcare centers, which so many working parents rely on. And imagine if we didn't do that, what the impact on the economy was. How many of those 220,000 women and men would be able to continue to work? And by the way, not a single Republican voted for that bill.
Next, I signed the bipartisan infrastructure law. How can we be the strongest nation in the world without the strongest infrastructure in the world? We're making intersections safer. We're making sure communities can connect the internetto the internet affordably and reliably. Making sure the water you drink is safe, protecting one of the most important things we can do by eliminating lead pipes in America so you can assure that the 400,000 schools in America, when your kid turns on that faucet to take a drink, they're not getting sick.
Look, we're making a whole economy stronger for years to come. We passed the CHIPS and Science Act, one of the most significant investments everever in American historyin manufacturing and research and development. We attracted over $400 billion in less than 2 years in private-sector investment, creating tens of thousands of jobs now and in the future.
We're going to lead the world again in manufacturing and sale of semiconductors. We invented them. We made them smaller. We made them more technically capable. And we ended up atbecause of the last 15 years, getting down to having only 10 percent of the market.
It's building the industries of the future and the small-businesses' supply chains to support them right here at home. I signed the Inflation Reduction Act, the most aggressive action to fight climate ever, anywhere in the world, creating new markets for small clean-energy companies.
Put all that together, and our plan is quite simple: Invest in America. You know, if I could hold a second here, you know, the fact is[applause]I want to make something clear.
We're in a situation where, back in the thirties, there was a proposal that we could invest any money the President spent of taxpayers' money, he could insist to be made by American manufacturers and use American products. But not many people had the willingness to do it, but I changed that.
The fact is, we're making it in America, we're building it in America, and we're using American products, and we're using American work.
And that investment is being led by all of you here, America's small businesses. And it's led byit's led to a small-business boom. Today, we're in the midst of the strongest economic recovery on record. In less than 2 years, we've created 12.6 million new jobs, more jobs in 2 years than any President has created in his first 4 years in office.
Unemployment is near a 50-percent [50-year; White house correction] low. Inflation is slowing down 40 percent since last year.
We have more to do. It's a historic turnaround, and it's giving people confidence to risk starting a new enterprise. And by the way, a record 10.5 million new business applications were filed in my first 2 years, the largest number ever on record in a 2-year period, and we're tracking it.
Every time someone starts a new business, you know what it is. It's an act of hope. It's an act of hope. It really matters. It's about who we are.
One year ago, I unveiled the administration's small-business strategy. Today we're releasing a report card on the progress we've made. Maybe I should say the progress you madeyou made.
We've seenwe've set a record for Federal contracts spendingcontracts spending on small businesses, making sure they benefit from the historic investment in America's infrastructure, industry, and the economy.
And we're working hard to expand access to capital to help promising businesses continue to grow. The Small Business Administration last year provided $43 billion in low-cost loans to many of you here on this lawn and all across America.
I finalized new rules to expand credit to rural, minority-, women-, veterans-owned enterprises by working with nontraditional lenders, like nonprofits. And it invested $10 billion in State-level small-business programs, drawing tens of billions more from private funding and smallfor small companies.
We've made all this progress whilebelieve it or not, if you don't listen to the other teamby being fiscally responsible. Unlike the last guy, my first 2 years, we cut the deficit 1.7 billion dollarstrilliontrilliontrillion dollars[applause]not billion, trillion dollarsin less than 2 years.
And we're going to bring it down hundreds of billions more in the decades ahead by making the superwealthy and big corporations begin to pay their fair share, just their fair share. By the way, you know, we have about a thousand billionaires. You know what their average tax rate is? Eighte-i-g-h-tpercent. [Laughter] Yes, that's what I think too. Eight percent. It's such a burden. Such burden on them.
And by the way, folks, how many of you thinkit's a serious question. Press can participate if they want to too. How many of you think the tax system we have today is fair? Notice all the hands that went up. [Laughter] Folks, that's why we instituted a corporate minimum tax of 15 percent15 percent. Hell, schoolteachers pay a hell of a lot more than 15 percent.
Look, now small business can finally start to compete on a level playing field.
And by the way, one of the reasons we were able to keep that debt down to $1.7 trillion and reduce the debt was because all that we didyou paidremember you'd hearyou got tired of hearing me speak in the last 2 years about the 550 American corporations that made a half a billionforty$400 billion and didn't pay a penny in taxes.
Somehow, people thought, like me, that wasn't a fair thing to do. So we got change. We set a 15-percent tax. What a burden. It paid for everything, and now the other team wants to repeal it because they think it's unfair to them.
Folks, look, all of that is a sharp contrast to our friends on the other side. Last week, Speaker McCarthy passed a partisan bill that would claw back billions of dollars meant for small businesses. It would gut training and support, make it harder for veterans-owned businesses to win Federal contracts. Slash funding for the Small Business Administration's Inspector General, who fights fraud and abuse to keep this president onthis program on the level.
Their extreme MAGA plan would cut critical funding for education, public safety, including cut 60,000 public schoolteachers, take health care and food assistance away from millions of working families. Moody's suggested it would cost us 780,000 jobs lost if it passednot me, Moody's. It would put the entire economy at risk by refusing to pay our Nation's bills.
Let me be clear: Our Nation's debt has taken over 200 years to accumulate. That's what we're paying. We're not paying for what we're spending right now. The 200 years200 years of debt. And by the way, in the previous 4 years, the last guy increased the entirety of the national debt by 40 percent.
Threatening default now would be totally responsibleirresponsible. It would lead to higher interest rates, higher credit card rates; mortgage rates would skyrocket. Working people, the middle class, and seniors would pay the price.
Let me close with this. You've made so much progress in the last 2 years. Now it's time for us to finish the job. Expand opportunities so people with great ideas can launch strong businesses, help grow our economy, and leave no one behind.
That's what entrepreneurs here today do what you're doing and continue to do. You see possibilities to make this all real. You're the big reason why I've never beenand I mean this sincerelyI've never been more optimistic about our future than I am today.
We just have to remember who we are. I really mean it. Think about it. We are the United States of America. There is not a damn thing beyond our capacity if we do it together.
We have never, ever, ever failed when we've set a goal and done it together. So, folks, let's keep it going.
And God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you.

NOTE: The President spoke at 12:32 p.m. in the Rose Garden at the White House. In his remarks, he referred to Jill Scarbro-McLaury, director and owner, Bright Futures Learning Services; and former President Donald J. Trump.
"
2023-04-29 00:00:00,Remarks at the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner,"
The President. Well, thank you, Tam, for that introductionI think. [Laughter]
Let me start on a serious note. Jill, Kamala, Doug, and I and members of our administration are here to send a message to the country and, quite frankly, to the world: The free press is a pillarmaybe the pillarof a free society, not the enemy.
Thomas Jefferson wrote[applause]you all know this quote. Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""Were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate . . . to prefer the latter.""
To Evan's parents Ella, Mikhail, and sister Danielle, as I've told you in person: Wenot just mewe all stand with you. Evan went to report in Russia to shed light on the darkness that you all escaped from years ago.
Absolute courage. A handwritten letter from prison to his family, Evan wrote, quote, ""I am not losing hope."" In an interview, his mom Ella said: ""One of the American qualities that we absorbed is to be optimistic. That's where we stand right now.""
To the entire family: Everyone in this hall stands with you. We're working every day to secure his release, looking at opportunities and tools to bring him home. We keep the faith.
We also keep the faith for AustinAustin Tice. His mom Debra is here tonight. She knows from our several conversationsthe conversations with me and my senior staffwe are not giving up.
As I told you at this dinner last year, as I told you in the Oval Office, you've raised an incredible son. When he was a kid, he was an Eagle Scout, a Big Brother, a born protector, a U.S. marinethree tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. AustinAustin was a fearless journalist and a future lawyer.
As a consequence of Austin showing the world the cost of war, he's been detained in Syria for nearly 11 years. It's simply wrong. It's outrageous. And we are not ceasing our effort to get him, find him, and bring him home.
Tonight our message is this: Journalism is not a crime. Evan and Austin should be released immediately, along with every other American held hostage or wrongfully detained abroad.
Paul Whelanunjustly held in Russia for more than 4 years, whose brave sister I've met with and whose family has never quit fighting for Paul. And I promise, you neither will I and neither will this administration until we get him home.
And there are other Americans being unjustly held in Iran, Venezuela, China, and elsewhere. Their stories may not make headlines or hashtags, but every dayevery daytheir family looks at that empty chair at the kitchen tablebirthdays, anniversaries, holidays without them. The pain of living in limbo, in a sense, is almost worse than the pain of having lost a child and looking at that empty chair. The stress of not knowing. The sorrow of uncertainty.
But I want them and their families to know Jill and I understand. We see them. They are not forgotten. And I promise you, I am working like hell to get them home. As a nation, we'll never give up on hope. Things can get better. Things can turn. Things can change.
Tonight, unlike last year, Brittney Griner is here with her wife Cherelle. Brittney, where you are, kid? Stand up. Come on. I love this woman. Love you, Brittney.
This time last year, we were praying for you, Brittney, hoping you knew how hard all of us were fighting for your release. It's great to have you home. And, boy, I can hardly wait to see you back on the court, kid. Remember your promise. I get to bring my granddaughter, my All-State girl, to see you. Right? [Laughter]
Because of our unrelenting efforts, we've been able to bring home dozens of hostages and wrongfully detaineeswrongful detainees from Afghanistan, Burma, Haiti, Iran, Rwanda, Venezuela, across West Africa, around the world.
But we're doing everything we can to prevent these cases from occurring in the first place. For example, the State Department added the threat of detention as a new risk indicator to its travel advisories to go along with the threat of kidnapping to warn Americans where these threats are highest abroad.
I also recently signed an Executive order increasing the consequences for criminal groups and terrorists who engage in the appalling practice of treating human beings as bargaining chips, political pawns. And, just 2 days ago, my administration announced the first sanctions under this new authority, punishing individuals and security services in Russia and Iran who've been part of the wrongful detention of Americans.
Above all, across Government, experts are working day and night to bring our fellow Americans home, much of which, as you well know, we can't talk about; concern that it will backfire. But my commitmentmy commitmentis to bring them home, just as I know your commitment is to continue to be a free and fearless press.
And that's what we honor tonight. And this is not hyperbole: You make it possibleyou make it possible for ordinary citizens to question authorityand yes, even to laugh at authoritywithout fear or intimidation. That's what makes this Nation strong.
So tonight let us show ourselves and the world our strength, not just by the example of our power, but by the power of our example.
Folks, I know a lot has changed in the press. I've had a lot of conversations with a lot of you. This is not your father's press from 20 years ago. No, I'm serious. And you all know it better than I do. But still, it is absolutely consequential and essential.
After all, I believe in the First Amendment, not just because my good friend Jimmy Madison wrote it. [Laughter]
Look, in a lot of ways, this dinner sums up my first 2 years in office. [Laughter] I'll talk for 10 minutes, take zero questions, and cheerfully walk away. [Laughter]
Yes, I know, I just announced my reelection campaign. Some of you[applause]. Some of you scooped that I'd announce in a video. But really, you really all thought in your heart that I'd just blurt it out, didn't you? [Laughter]
White House Correspondents' Association Vice President Kelly O'Donnell of NBC News. We tried. [Laughter]
The President. And look, I get that age is a completely reasonable issue. It's on everybody's mind. And everyoneby ""everyone"" I mean the New York Times. [Laughter] Headline: ""Biden's Advanced Age Is a Big Issue. Trump's, However, Is Not."" [Laughter]
Sorry, that was a New York Times Pitchbot. I apologize. [Laughter] I love that guy. I should do an interview with him. [Laughter]
You might think I don't like Rupert Murdoch. That's simply not true. How could I dislike the guy who makes me look like Harry Styles? [Laughter]
You call me old? I call it being seasoned. You say I'm ancient? I say I'm wise. You say I'm over the hill? Don Lemon would say that's a man in his prime. [Laughter]
Folks, it's wonderful to be back here again, proving I haven't learned a damn thing. [Laughter] I want everybody to have fun tonight, but please be safe. If you find yourself disoriented or confused, it's either you're drunk or Marjorie Taylor Greene. [Laughter]
Tam, thank you for hosting us. I love NPR
[At this point, the President leaned toward the microphone.]
because they whisper into the mike like I do. [Laughter] But not everybody loves NPR. Elon Musk tweeted that it should be defunded. Well, the best way to make NPR go away is for Elon Musk to buy it. [Laughter] And that's more true than you think. [Laughter] Anyway.
This dinner is one of the two great traditions in Washington. The other one is underestimating me and Kamala. Well, the truth is, we really have a record to be proud of. Vaccinated the Nation. Transformed the economy. Earned historic legislative victories and midterm results.
But the job isn't finished. I mean, it is finished for Tucker Carlson.
Audience members. Ooh!
The President. What are you wooing about like that? [Laughter] Like you think that's not reasonable? Give me a break. [Laughter] Just give me a break.
Look, like I often say, don't compare me to the Almighty, compare me to the alternative. We added 12 million jobs, and that's just counting the lawyers towho defended the President. [Laughter]
Had Ron DeSantisI had a lot of Ron DeSantis jokes ready, but Mickey Mouse beat the hell out of me and got there first. [Laughter] Now, look, can't be too rough on the guy. After his reelection as Governor, he was asked if he had a mandate. He said, ""Hell no, I'm straight."" [Laughter] ""I'm straight.""
I'll give you time to think that one through.
Ms. O'Donnell. That's good. That's good.
Vice President Kamala D. Harris. That's really nice. 
The President. You got it?
Vice President Harris. Really good. [Laughter]
The President. Look, you all keep reporting my approval rating is at 42 percent. But what do youbut I think you don't know this: Kevin McCarthy called me and asked me, ""Joe, what the hell is your secret?"" [Laughter] I'm not even kidding about that one. [Laughter]
The Speaker is trying to claim a big win this week, but the last time Republicans voted on something thisthat hapless, it took 15 tries.
Audience members. Ooh!
The President. That was good. [Laughter]
Look, it's great the cable news networks are here tonight: MSNBC, owned by NBC Universal; Fox News, owned by Dominion Voting Systems. [Laughter]
Last year, your favorite Fox News reporters were able to attend because they were fully vaccinated and boosted. This year, with that $787 million settlement, they're here because they couldn't say no to a free meal. [Laughter]
And hell, I'd call Fox honest, fair, and truthful, but then I could be sued for defamation. [Laughter] It ain't nothing compared to what they do to me. [Laughter]
Look, I hope the Fox News team finds this funny. My goal is to make them laugh as hard as CNN did when they read the settlement. [Laughter] But then again, CNN was like, ""Wow, they actually have $787 million?"" [Laughter] Whoa.
Folks, I go where people are, ""The Daily Show."" Roy is a great guy. He once dubbed me the Jay-Z of Delaware. [Laughter] Don't let that look on your face. You did.
Tonight he asked me to keep it short. He even offered me 10 bucks if I'd keep it under 10 minutes. That's a switch: a President being offered hush money. [Laughter]
Look, I'm going to leave the jokes to the pros. But let me conclude on a genuinely serious note. Roy was born in Birmingham, Alabama. He graduated from a great HBCU, Florida A&M. He started in journalism to follow in the footsteps of his father, Roy Wood, Sr., who covered the civil rights movement.
During Black History Month this year, I hosted the screening of the movie ""Till."" The story of Emmett Till and his mother is a story of a family's promise and loss and a nation's reckoning with hate, violence, and the abuse of power.
It's a story that was seared into our memory and our consciencethe Nation's consciencewhen Mrs. Till insisted that an open casket for her murdered and maimed 14-year-old son be the means by which he was transported. She said, ""Let the people see what I've seen.""
The reason the world saw what she saw was because of another hero in this story: the Black press. That's a fact. JET magazine, the Chicago Defender, and other Black radio and newspapers were unflinching and brave in making sure America saw what she saw. And I mean it.
Ida B. Wells[applause]. Ida B. Wells once said, and I quote, ""The way to right wrongs is to turn the light of truth upon the wrongs."" Turn the light of truth upon the wrongs. That's the sacred view, in my view. That's the sacred charge of a free press. And I mean that.
That's what someone we still miss so much, who you honored posthumously, stood for. Gwen Ifill. You know, she was among the very best. We talked about it at the table. She moderated my first debate for Vice President and was a trusted voice for millions of Americans.
Gwen understood that the louder the noise, the more it's on all of us to cut through the noise to the truth. The truth matters.
As I said last year at this dinner, a poison is running through our democracy and parts of the extreme press. The truth buried by lies and lies living on as truth.
Lies told for profit and power. Lies of conspiracy and malice repeated over and over again, designed to generate a cycle of anger, hate, and even violence. A cycle that emboldens history to be buried, books to be banned, children and families to be attacked by the state, and the rule of law and our rights and freedoms to be stripped away. And where elected representatives of the people are expelled from statehouses for standing for the people.
I've made clear that we know in our bonesand you know it tooour democracy remains at risk. But I've also made it clear, as I've seen throughout my life, it's within our power, each and every one of us, to preserve our democracy. We can. We must. We will.
I'd like to make a toastif I had a glass. [Laughter]
[The President was handed a glass by White House Correspondents' Association President Tamara Keith of NPR.]
My grandfather Ambrose Finnegan said, ""If you ever make a toast without liquor, you've got to hold it in your left hand."" [Laughter] You all think I'm kidding. I'm not. I'm probably the only Irishman you've ever met who's never had a drink in his life. But anyway.
I'd like to make a toast, seriously.
At this inflection point in history, let us commit that we'll be a nation that will embrace light over darkness, truth over lies, and finally, finally, finally restore the soul of the Nation.
Hear, hear.
[The President offered a toast.]
Audience members. Hear, hear.
The President. Ladies and gentleman
Can I give you that?
Ms. Keith. Yes.
[The President handed Ms. Keith his glass.]
The President. I'm going to turn us over to Roy. Roy, the podium is yours.
I'm going to be fine with your jokes, but I'm not sure about Dark Brandon.
[The President put on a pair of sunglasses.]
[Laughter] It's all yours, pal.

2023-04-28 00:00:00,Remarks on Presenting the Commander in Chief's Trophy to the United States Air Force Academy Falcons,"
The President. Gentlemen, please have a seat. Thank you.
Well, good afternoon, everyone. You probably heard we've got a ball club here today. And it's great to welcome the Falcons and so many of their fans to the White House for this ceremony.
That includes our Second Gentleman, Doug, and our Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Mark Milley. He played hockey. [Laughter] And you wouldn't want to screw around if any of you had your uniform on, I don't think.
But I'd also like to[laughter]I'd also like to welcome the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, General Charles Brown. Charles, stand up so everybody can see you. This is your team. All right. And the Vice Chief of Space Operations, General Davis [David; White House correction] Thompson. General, stand up so they can see you.
Representative Don Davis is here, a proud graduate of the Academy. Congratulations, ole' buddy.
Lieutenant General Richard Clark, Superintendent of the Air Force Academy. Wherewhere isthere you are. Get up there, man. When I met the team, I thought he was the middle linebacker. [Laughter] You're looking good, General. [Laughter]
You know, I played a little football growing up in high school; I wasn't bad. In college, I was bad. [Laughter] But I learned so much about teamwork and respect from my coaches andand just like you fellas did.
And, Coach Calhoun, it's an honor to have you here. It really is an honor to have you here. And in fact, you've been here for this trophy so often I think they're going to start calling itthe Blue Room""Long Blue Line"" Room trophy. [Laughter]
In a few weeks, I'll be headed to your home turf for commencementyou're going to get stuck with me being your commencement speakerand where 10 of these cadets behind me will officially become officers in the United States Air Force and Space Force.
About 65 years ago, during the first remarks to the first class of the Air Force Academy, President EisenhowerI wasn't therePresident[laughter]no matter what the press says. [Laughter] But President Eisenhower said, and I quote, ""The basic soul of what you establish now will live on."" End of quote. ""The basic soul . . . will live on.""
Well, what is that soul? I believe the soul is the breath, the life, and the essence of who we are. The soul is what makes us ""us."" Simply put, you can't talk about the soul of the Nation without talking about our service academies. And I believe that. And you can't talk about the service academies without talking about duty, teamwork, service, and excellence. That's all about you.
Five All-Americans, 15 bowl wins, and now 21 Commander in Chief Trophies. And I expect you to carry it home, Coach. [Laughter] You see it over there? That'syou know, that trophy is bigger than the Super Bowl trophy. [Laughter] No, it really is. So you may need help carrying it. But at any rate.
More than any other Academy. With stats like that, you might assume that you'd all end up here today, that it was inevitable. But you knew it wasn't inevitable. You knew how the hard work and teamwork and having each other's backshow much it would take to keep this legacy leavingliving on.
And so, by game day, play by play, you ground it out together. You beat Navy. You beat Army. You beat Colorado for good measure[laughter]just to let them know whowhose State it really was.
And after looking at the scoreboard, they must have been thinking you took your service motto""Aim High,"" ""Always Above""pretty seriously. And at home, on the road, you also broke record after record. The number-one defensive team in the Nation by yards allowed. Pretty darn impressive, man. And the number-one rushing offense in the Nation, averaging over 300 yards a game. As they say in Delaware, ""You done good, kid."" [Laughter] That is pretty impressive300 yards a game.
And how about a fullback and cocaptain in Brad Roberts who became the first ever to win the national rushing title. Congratulations, buddy.
Or quarterback and cocaptain Haaziq Daniels, who set two school records: one for the longest run from the line of scrimmage, 94 yards. As a quarterback, they must have been really chasing you, man. [Laughter] And the second: the longest completed pass, 92 yards. That ain't bad. I'd[applause].
Folks, or offensive lineman Isaac Cochran who became the Academy's first All-American player in 30 years. Isaac, where are you? There you go, pal. And, Isaac, if I say anything you don't like, let me know ahead of time, will you? [Laughter] Congratulations, buddy. That's incredible.
And on top of all this, you defeated the Baylor Bears in the Armed Forces Bowl, the coldest bowl game ever, just 11 degrees. I don't know how you all set that up, but you did it well. [Laughter] Or as you call it in Colorado Springs, a balmy spring day. [Laughter]
You had all those wins while drilling, training, and serving day in and day out at the Academy as cadets. After every game, you hung up your uniform and you immediately put on another one representing your Nation, the United States of America.
Simply put, you've not only carried on the Academy's football traditions, you've stepped up to join a long line of American servicemembers, each a link in a chain of honoreach one.
And you know that when it comeswhen youwhen you do become officers, that it's the team that matters most. You continue to have each other's backs. An Air Force team, a Space Force team. Together, you represent the very best of who we are as Americans, and that's not hyperbole.
Your school mottoif I take a little liberty with ityou put integrity first, service before self, and excellence in all you do. In all you do. That's not only your school motto, it's who you are. It's who you are: proud not only to have achieved, but all that you can do if you continue to work together. That's who you are. That is why you're the soul.
And like President Eisenhower said all those years ago, that soul will now live on another generation thanks to you and all our brave servicemembers and their families.
So as your Commander in Chief, it's my honor to award you the Commander in Chief's Trophy.
As I said, Coach, why don't you show people how you can pick up, hold it over your head for a while? [Laughter] And I said, it's bigger than the Super Bowl trophy.
It's pretty incredible, isn't it?
Head Coach Troy Calhoun. Yes, sir.
The President. I know it's not the first time you've seen it. [Laughter]
So congratulations. And one more thing: ""Let's Fly!"" ""Let's Fly!""
May God bless you all, and may God bless all our airmen and graduates. And of a particular thanks to your families.
And now I'm going to hand this over to Coach Calhoun to say a few words. Coach, you can use either mike. Congratulations.
Coach Calhoun. Thank you, Mr. President.
Mr. President, how grateful we are, and it's all of us. I mean, truly, the remarkable leadership of our Superintendent, his wifeLieutenant General Rich Clark and Amythe fantastic standard that they set there at the Academy, their inspiration, their principles, their discipline, but most of all, just their day in, day out commitment to our young men and young women there at the United States Air Force Academy.
On behalf of our Athletic Director, Mr. Nathan Pine, and the entire United States Air Force Academy, how fortunate we are to have great, great support, not only in here withwithin the confines of Washington, DC, but throughout our Nation. And unequivocally, we already have 10 that have graduated that are out doing splendid things in both our Air and our Space Force. And hopefully real soon, here in 4 weeks, we have 10 more that will serve and serve so, so well.
And it's our honor to be here, but even more so, it's our honor to serve the greatest Nation in the world, the United States of America.
And at this time, I'm going to bring upnow, he's from New Jersey, not Delaware.
The President. That's good. I married a Jersey girl. [Laughter]
Coach Calhoun. Oh, okay. [Laughter]
Our two captains: Haaziq Daniels, quarterback, and running back Brad Roberts. And, sir, they have a couple of small items here for you.
[At this point, the President was presented with a team jersey, football, and helmet.]
The President. Whoa.
Where I'm going tonight, I may need that helmet. [Laughter]
Go down, out, and down. Okay?
[The President pretended to pass the football.]
[Laughter] Well, thank you very much. What a great, great honor. I appreciate it very much. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

"
2023-04-28 00:00:00,Remarks at a Democratic National Committee Reception,"
Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Hello, hello, hello. Folks, it's so great to have you here. And I want to thank Jaime for that introduction. And, Jaime, thanks for your leadership.
The first thing I want to say tonight is Jill and me, Kamala and Doug, want to thank you. And I really mean it. Seriously, thank you, thank you, thank you. Last time out when we ran, you shocked the hell out of me, how much effort you put in and how much money you raised. I never raised that much money before. [Laughter] And Jill was so glad to see all of you this evening. She just had to leave to attend an event for our daughter Ashley, who's in town tonight.
So many of you have been with us through an incredible, incredible ride for 2020 right through to today. And some have been with me since I've been a United States Senator. Jaime mentioned many of you individually, but I also want to say to the Members of the House and the Senate, the Governors who are here tonight: You've been key partners in everything we've gotten done. And that's not hyperbole. Every single thing we've gotten done has gotten done because of that strong leadership in the States and in the House and the Senate.
And those helping lead the DNC and cochairing my campaign, and to all you who have had my back through all of it and are here tonight because you really, really did a great job. And we couldn't have done it without you. And I thinkit sounds like you're ready to do it again, so thank you, thank you, thank you.
And I also want you to know and thank those literally tens of thousands of people across the country who have stepped up this week, signed up to volunteer, donated 5, 10 bucks, once again got the campaign off to such a strong, strong start. It really isamazed me the number of people who came back. The enthusiasm has been overwhelming. I can't tell you how much it means to me. I really mean it. And I think I could speak the same thing for Kamala.
And, folks, we've already accomplished a lot after being told we wouldn't be able to get anything doneremember?in 2020. It was going to be ait was going to be just a freeze on everything. But with the help of all of you here and many of my colleagues in the House and Senate, we've generated 12 million brandnew jobs in 2 years, more than any President has created in any single 4-year term. Unemployment is at 3.5 percent, a 50-year low.
You know how much this matters. We passed the American Rescue Plan, the most aggressive economic recovery plan since Franklin Delano Roosevelt. We passed the most substantial investment in our Nation's infrastructure since Eisenhower: the bipartisan infrastructure law. We passed the CHIPS and Science Act, the most significant investment in manufacturing and research developed in American history. It led to $400 billion in private investment in manufacturing and clean energy, creating tens of thousands of jobs before it's finished, all across America.
You know, the Inflation Reduction Act has been the most transformational investment in our climate in the history of not just the country, but history of the world. It's going to reduce carbon emissions by 1 billion tons in 2030. And we're on track to get to net-zero emissions by 2050 worldwide. And, folks, as you all know, climate change poses an existential threat to humanity, to our children and our grandchildren. We owe it to them. We really owe it to them to rise to this existential challenge.
You know, the Inflation Reduction Actthe first time in history. And Tommy Carper and Ihe's been there a long time, and a lot of us in the Senate have been fighting like hell to get Medicare to be able to negotiate drug prices with pharma. Well, as you know, we pay the highest drug cost of any advanced nation in the world. In the world. Significantly more. But now we reduced the cost of insulin from hundreds of dollars a month to $35 a month for anyone on Medicare.
And soon, no seniorand the reasonwe're going to have to make sure everybody knows this because thisit doesn't all come at once; it comes in stages. No senior is going to have to pay more than $2,000 for the totality of all the drugs they need forand including expensive cancer drugs that cost $10-, $12-, $14,000 a year, beginning in 2025.
Folks, we passed the most significant legislation to reduce gun violence in 30 years, strengthening background checks, red flag laws, elimination of ghost guns. And we have a lot more to do. We have more to do. And we kept our promise to put the first Black woman on the Supreme Court. And thanks to Dick Durbin, the head of the Judiciary Committee in the Senate, we've approved more Black women in the Federal circuit courts than all previous Presidents combined in American history. We've kept our promise.
And I don't think it's an exaggeration to say we've reestablished America's leadership in the world. Madeleine was right: We are the essential country.
We united and strengthened NATO when Putin was certain that he was going to be able to break NATO down and[inaudible]invasion in Ukraine. In short, we restored America's standing on the world stage. And just some of thatsome of that, what we managed, is with the help of you. Just in 2 years we did it. Imagine how much we can do. I'm here tonight to ask your help to help me finish the job.
And, folks, here's the bottom line. It's very simple: We need you. Our democracy needs you, because this is about our freedoms. MAGA Republicans are trying to take us backwards. But together, we're not going to let them do it. Not an inch back. Instead, our agenda is going to continue to bring us forward and build on the progress we madeand we made. And we must finish this job.
Look, let's keep growing the economy in the middlefrom the middle out and the bottom up. Let's protectprotect a woman's right to choose and codify Roe v. Wade. Let's protect our children from gun violence by continuing to work to eliminate assault weapons. And let's keep lowering the prescription drug cost not just for those on Medicare, but for all Americansfor all Americans. Folks, we've got to continue to protect Social Security and Medicaresomething people have paid into their whole life, provide for such solace for so many Americans.
You know, we've gotten a lot done, but there's so much more to do. And with your help, I know we can do it. I really do. Just like we did in 2020. Remember 2020, when everyone had written us off? But you folksyou folks in this room, you know we could do it, and we did. You raised significant amounts of money to allow us to compete.
And remember 2022, the midterm elections, when we were supposed to get our clock clean and swamped? ""The red wave is coming."" Give me a break. [Laughter] Because of your help, weit never happened, and we met the moment again and againa broad coalition with all of you. And we're going to do it again in 2024 together. And, folks, as we enter this reelection campaign, hear this: We wouldn't be here without you. That is notthat's not an exaggeration.
And I couldn't be more grateful. All of you with us again tonight, we're counting on you. We really are counting on you. Because, folks, we're still in the battle for the soul of this country.
You heard me say it before: We're at an inflection point in American history. We've been there at least four or five other occasions in our history. I had a professor in college. He said an inflection point is when you're going down a highway 50 miles an hour, and you veer off at 40 degrees in another direction, you're never going to be able to get in the same path you were on before.
Well, that's where the world is now. One of those moments that come along every several generations where the decisions we make today are going to determine the trajectory not only of the United States, but the world for decades to come. And think about it. It's not hyperbole. Think about what's happening with climate change worldwide. Think of what the change in allegiances of nations around the world. Think of all that's going on. All that's going on.
And it means we carry a heavy responsibility, but it also means we have an extraordinary opportunityan extraordinary opportunity to build a future we want for our children and our grandchildren. An extraordinary opportunity to meet the commitment I made in 2020 that we will restore the soul of this Nation, to build an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, unite the country.
We're going to build an America that's more fair, more just, more free. And we're going to literally build a better world. And that fills me with optimism. In fact, I've never beenand I mean this sincerely; a lot of you know me really well. I've never been more optimistic about America's future than I am today. Not in my whole career.
I've always believed we could define America in one word. I was in theI was in the Tibetan Plateau with Xi Jinping, who I've met with more than any other world leader has. And he turned to me. We justhe and I, and each had a simultaneous interpreter. And he said, ""Could you define America for me?"" And this is the God's truth. I said, ""Yes, I can, in one word: possibilities.""
We're the only nation in the world who believes anything is possible when we put our mind to it. And we have never failed at anything we've decided to do. And I still believe it today. There's literally nothing we can't do if we put our mind to it. We just have to remember who in God's name we are. We are the United States of America. There's nothing beyond our capacity if we do it together.
So let's go. Let's win this thing. Let's finish the job. Let's get it done. Because there's so muchso muchwe can do and set in motion in the ability for this country to have a path of world leadership.
And by the way, you know, you all remember our former Secretary of State. She used to say that we are the ""essential nation."" I can assure youand I mean it sincerelynot because of Joe BidenI walk in a room of world leaders and everything changes. They all look at us and wonder ""What are you going to do, America?"" Not a joke. Not a joke. The United States of America they look to to lead the world.
And, folks, we can do this. We can do this. We really can. And I really, truly, from the bottom of my heart, thank you all for the help. Because it'syou know, you raised more money for me last time than I raised in my whole life. [Laughter] You think I'm kidding? I'm not.
And, folks, you also stepped up. Because not only did you raise money; most of you are leaders in your community, leaders infor all that you do, in the businesses and theand everything you're involved in. And when people look at you and say, ""He or she is for that person with this kind of intensity,"" it changes their mind.
And we've got one other real problem and one other real advantage. The real problem is those MAGA Republicans. They're 30 percent of the Republican Party, but there's athere'sthis is not your father's Republican Party. But in a bizarre way, all we've got to do is point out, in many cases, and compare us to what these guys want to do.
Look what they just introduced. Look what they just passed in the House. We'd lose 100,000 teachersI'm not going to go on iton right now, because we've got to get some dinner. [Laughter] But, folks, there's so much we can do, and we can contribute so much to the country right now. And it's because of you I'm standing here, and it's going to be because of you we win this next time around.
So thank you, thank you very much. As myyou've heard me say this beforeI just got back from Ireland, dealing with two things: one, making sure the Accord stuck together, but, two, I also went back to the two home counties my mother's family are from. And every time I'd walk out of my grandfather's Finnegan's home, he'd yell, ""Joey, keep the faith."" And my grandmother would""No, Joey. Spread it."" Let's spread the faith. Thank you.
By the way, this has been a busman's holiday for the Governors and the Senators, having to come hear another pol speak, but thank you all for doing it. We've got some great, great Governors. You know, 2322 Governors already endorsed us. I don't think that's ever happened beforeall the Democratic Governors. So thank you, thank you, thank you, Governors. Thanks to everyone. Now get out of here.

2023-04-27 00:00:00,Remarks in a Videoconference Call With Grassroots Supporters of the President's 2024 Reelection Campaign,"
The First Lady. Thank you, Jose. Good evening. Every few years, we tell Americans that this is the most important election of their lives. And every year, we're rightbecause the fight for freedom has no end. The fight for democracy, for America has no end. There will always be those who want to pull us backwards, who can only see glory in some imagined past.
So when they pull, we push. We push for progress. We push for the people we love. We push for the future we want, the future our children deserve. And when we all push together, shoulder to shoulder and heart to heart, we win.
That's what we did when we elected Joe and Kamala. I will never forget the moment we got word that they had won. We were sitting on a dock of a lake near our home in Wilmington. And then all of a sudden, we heard shouts of joy coming from our house. And we knew we had won.
Don't you remember it? The people who were banging pots and pans and dancing in the streets. It was like we were all holding our breath and suddenly we could breathe again. You made that possible: with a dozen phone calls, with a $5 donation, with a conversation you were a little nervous to have.
Just tiny moments again and again, until, together, we created something bigger than any one of us. So thank you for that work. Thank you for standing with us then and now.
With your help, Joe has changed our country for good. America has seen the true character of the person I've known for so long, whose heart is big enough to cross our divides and bring together Americans from all walks of life; whose vision and determination are strong enough to cut through the partisanship of our politics and pass historic legislation; whose commitment is steadfast enough not only to keep his promises, but surpass them.
And he's not done. He's ready to keep pushing us forward. We will win again, but not without you. We're all in this. And I'm asking you to be all in as well. Help us with those small moments: dollars donated, calls made, and doors knocked. We have to start now.
And we can't let up until we win. Because the fight for freedom doesn't end, and this is the most important election of our lives. I know we can win because we have you by our side.
Joe.
The President. Well, look, everyone, hello. Jill and I, and Kamala and Doug, wanted to get together for two reasons, all of us. One, the first is to thank you. So many of you were with us throughout the incredible ride in 2020, through to this very day. We wouldn't be here without you. And that's not hyperbole. We're counting on you to help us win this next time around. We can't do it without you. Just look at all we've accomplished so far. And think about everything else we can do together.
Let's finish the job. And we're within reach. And that's the second reason I wanted to talk to you. We need you. As Jill said, our democracy needs you. And that's, again, notthat's literal. Because this is about our freedoms.
MAGA Republicans are trying to take us backwards. But together, we're not going to let them do that. Instead, our agenda is going to bring us forward and build on the progress we made to finish the job.
Look, we keep growing the economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not from the top down. We said we'd do that. Let's protect a woman's right to choose. Let's get Roe v. Wade.
It's just a longthere's just so much we have to do. Look, let's protect our children from gun violence, keep lowering the prescription drug cost. Let's protect Social Security and Medicare. We've gotten so much done, but there's so much more to do.
Folks, we're still in the battle for the soul of America. And now we're at an inflection point. One of those moments not only that come around every few generations, they come around, and we're in one of them right now. And when we look back years from now, we'll know whether we met this moment.
You know, so you've got tolet me tell you something, because that's so important: Because of all of you, we will meet this momentbecause of youjust like we did in 2020. Remember 2020, as Jill said, when everyone had us written off? But you knew we could do it, and we did because of you.
Remember 2022, those midterm elections. That red wave was supposed to wipe us out and a gigantic victory for Republicans. It never happened. We met the moment again and again with a broad coalition, with all of you. We're going to do it again in 2024. We're going to do it together.
So as we enter this reelection campaign, Jill and I, Kamala and Doug, want you to remember the power of America lies with you, the American people. You. You know all this. And now we need you to spread the word to our friends. Go to joebiden.com or text ""share"" to 30330.
You're the reason we've never been more optimistic about our future. And weI've never been more optimistic. We just have to remember who we are. We're the United States of America. And there's simply nothing beyond our capacity if we do it together.
So let's go win this thing. Let's finish the job. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Let's get it done.

So I have a son who lives in California, but comes once in a while with his family.
And I have a daughter who lives up in Philadelphia. She's ashe works to help women who are victims of violence, and she's a social worker. And every once in a while, she comes down with her husband.
And then, the best part of it all, I have six grandchildren. And I'm crazy about them. And I speak to them every single day. Not a joke. Matter of fact, I just got finished going through the calls. And only one of them answered the phone. [Laughter] But at least I got to leave a message.
At leastand they'remy oldest granddaughter is named after one of my daughters who I lost in an accident a long time ago. And her name is Naomi.
And then I have number twoI have a daughter [granddaughter; White House correction] who works in the environmental movement. And her name is Finnegan andnamed after my mom.
And number three, my granddaughterI call her my ""All-American girl."" She was a great little athlete. And she's about to graduate from college in about 2 weeks. And her nameher name isshe'sthe nickname we call her is ""Maisy.""
And then I have two othera granddaughter who I just spokedid get to speak to. And her name is Natalie, and she is a senior in high school about to graduate and go off to college where her daddy went to school.
And then I have a grandson who's going to be a senior in high school.
And then, now I have a newa newbaby boy. He's 3 years old. And his daddy named him after his brother, my deceased son. And he's Beau Biden.
Soand guess what? They're crazy about me[laughter]because I pay so much attention to them.
Anybody else have any questions? Yes, baby. What do you have? Oh
Child. My name is Amelia. And where are yourwhere are your grandsons or granddaughters?
The President. Where? Okay. Her name is Amelia. She wants to know where my granddaughters are.
One granddaughter lives in Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia. One granddaughter lives in New York. One granddaughter lives in Washington. One granddaughter lives in Wilmington, Delaware. And the other grandsonsmy grandson lives in California.
But I left somebody out, didn't I? Anyway. Philadelphia, Wilmington, and
Child. There are six, but you only said five.
The President. I did say five. You're right.
So let me see. I've got one in New York, two in Philadelphiaor is it three? No, three, because I've got one granddaughter who isI don't know. [Laughter] You're confusing me. But they're all around. Wilmington, California, New York, and Philadelphiathe cities they live in.
Yes, honey.
Child. I'm[inaudible]and I wanted to ask: Why did you want to become the President?
The President. Why did I want to become the President? Well, you know, when I was younger, 120 years ago[laughter]when I was younger, I was inI lived in a State thatit was very hard for African Americans to have a fair chance. It was segregated by law.
And so, as a high school student, I got involved in what was called the civil rights movement. And so one of the things that was happening in my State was, we were trying to get people to run to fight for civil rights, and we were having trouble getting that many people to run thewhen I started off. And they asked me to run.
And I said I didn't want to. And then, my sister, who's my best friendmy sister used to be 3 years younger than me. Now she's 20 years younger than me. [Laughter] We went to the same university. She graduated with honors; I graduated. [Laughter]
But she managed my campaign, and so we ran in a district where my teamthe team I belong tohadn't won. And so I said, okay, I'd runbeing the good sport. But guess what? We won because of my sister.
And next thing I know, theyone thing had aone thing came after another. And then it turned out that I ended up being a Senator for a long time. And then, Barack ObamaPresident Obama asked me to be his Vice President. And then I ran for President 4 years later.
Yes, honey.
Child. What's your favorite ice cream flavor?
The President. Now she's talking my language. What's my favorite ice cream flavor? [Laughter] I may be among the dullest Presidents of the world because I'm known for two things: my Ray-Ban sunglasses and chocolate-chip ice cream. That's my favorite.
Down here. Yes, what's yourwhat is your question, honey?
Child. My question is, what makes you hopeful for the next generation of America?
The President. You.
He said, what makes me hopeful for the next generation of Americans?
The generation of Americans from you guys to the people all the way to their late twenties is the most open, the least prejudiced, the best educated, and the most giving generation in American history. For real. Not a joke.
And that's why I'm so hopeful. Because in America, we can do anythinganything at allif we do it together. For real. There's not a single thing we can't do.
And what gives me the most hope is all of you guys. For real. And that's the God's truth.
At any rate, yes.
Child. What's your favorite color?
The President. My favorite color is blue. [Laughter]
All right. Not because itwhen I started off, it wasn't red and blue States. It waseverything wasanyway[laughter]. But that's my favorite color.
Child. How did you become a President?
The President. I became a President by go and asking people like your mommy and daddyand I don't know your mommy and daddybut asking them to look me over. I'd say: ""Look me over. And if you like what you see, help out. If not, vote for the other guy. But give me a look.""
Andbut I ran because I think America is not only the greatest nation in the world, but we havewe can do more than any other nation to keep peace and to help people going.
I'm going to take two more. I'm getting myself in trouble here because your parents are saying, ""When is he going to stop?"" [Laughter] And my Secret Service agents, they're packing, so I've got to be careful what they tell me. [Laughter]
I'm going to go down at this end for just a minute. Okay? And then I'll finish up here. Okay? Hang on.
Okay. The lady in pink. You.
Child. Me? Oh.
The President. Fire away.
Child. Hello. Okay
[At this point, another child whispered a question as follows.]
Child. What he'd eat for breakfast?
Child. Oh, what have you eaten for breakfast? And also, can I have a fist bump?
The President. You can have a fist bump. And I had a bacon and cheese on a croissant.
Child. Thank you. I'm going to try that.
The President. I mean bacon, scrambled egg, and cheese on a croissant.
Child. That sounds good.
The President. I forgot the scrambled egg.
Yes, honey.
Child. Can I have a fist bump?
The President. Sure, you can have a fist bump.
Child. Can I have a fist bump?
The President. You sure can.
Child. My name is Sophie. I was wondering what your biggest accomplishment so far in the White House has been.
The President. Well, I think the biggest accomplishment we've had so far is helping people being able to get health care and be able to afford health care.
You know, people needyou know, your moms and dads and a lot of people you know need prescription drugs. They need a prescription to stay healthy.
I'll give you one example. Do you know anybodyany of you kids know anybody who has diabetesany kid you know? Well, guess what? It used to be, when I came to the office, that to pay for the diabetes for a month, a lot of parents had to pay three, four, five hundred dollars a month.
Child. That's a lot of money.
The President. Well, I was able to change it. They don't have to pay more thanthey're not going to have to pay more than $35 a month for that. Those kinds of things.
The other thing is, I think one of the biggest things isand it's not complicated, but it is a little bit. There is a concern when I got elected whether or notI'll get your question[laughter]there is a concern thatwhether or not we would hold all of our allies together, the people in EuropeFrance, England, Italy, Germanyto stay with a thing called ""NATO,"" the North Atlantic Treaty assembly. And we've always been able to keep the peace since World War II that way.
And so I spent a lot of time pulling all those folks together to stay on the same page to take on the Russian aggression, what they're doing to the poor people in Ukraine. And so I think I'd consider that an accomplishment.
And the third thing I think is an accomplishment is that, you know, we have to be the strongest and most prosperous nation in the world, we have to have the bestwhat they call infrastructure: bridges, roads, highways, internet, all those things.
And I was able to convince a lot of my Republican friends to join us. And so we passed a significant bill to rebuild all our roads and all the things that are going to make your generation much, much stronger.
Yes, honey.
Child. Who is your biggest inspiration?
The President. My biggest inspiration? Let me see. Whopolitically, my biggest inspiration was probably Dr. Martin Luther King. But, in terms of personally, my biggest inspiration were my mom and my dad.
My momfor real, my dad used to say things when he was alive. He'd say: ""Remember to be a person of your word, to be a man or a woman of your word, you have to keep your word. Whatever you say, you have to commit to. You have to stick with what you say and tell the truth. And it really does matter.""
And my mom used to say, ""Just remember, Joey: Never bow, never bend, never kneel. Just get up and fight back."" And that's for real. And so I think my mom and dad were my two biggest inspirations.
Yes.
Child. How many guards are in the building?
The President. How many guards in the building? Well, other than the four Secret Service people over there right in front of the podiumbut you know, to tell you the truth, I don't know how many there are. There's a whole bunch, though. [Laughter] There's a whole bunch.
I don't know, honey. There's a lot. I wish I knew the number. I don't know.
Yes, baby.
Child. What is it like in the White House?
The President. Well, what's it like in the White House? Well, here. Come here. You hang with me for a minute and Iyou don't want to go into the White House. Okay, all right. [Laughter] Okay.
Child. Do you watch the Stanley Cup playoffs? And if you do, do you have a favorite team?
The President. I did, and I do. The Philadelphia Flyers.
Child. I'm rooting for the Devils.
The President. Oh, you're
Child. I'm rooting for the Devils.
The President. All right. That's a good thing.
Child. Can I have a fist bump?
The President. Yes. There you go. Hey, man.
Child. Can I have a selfie? And what was your favorite team in the Super Bowl final round?
The President. Well, let me grab that. Whowhat was your favorite team?
Child. Kansas City Chiefs.
The President. I've got to admit, it was the other team for me. But Kansas City is pretty cool.
You ready?
[The President posed for a photograph.]
There you go.
Child. Can I see? Can I try?
Child. What do I say?
The President. Whatever you want to say. Want to make a speech?
Child. Yes.
The President. What's your name?
Child. Yuri.
The President. Did you have a question?
Child. Yes.
The President. Want to tell me what it is?
Child. Yuri Newman. [Laughter]
Woman. He said he's named Yuri Newman. [Laughter]
Child. That'sthat sounds crazy.
The President. Can't answer that one.
Child. What was the last country you traveled to?
The President. The last country I've traveledI'm thinking what's the last one I was in. I've been to 89I met with 89 heads of state so far. So I'm trying to think.
What was the lastwhere was the last place I was? It's hard to keep track.
Child. Ireland!
The President. I wasI mean, yes, you're right. Ireland. [Laughter] That's where it was. How'd you know that?
Child. I'm going to Ireland too.
The President. Oh, you're kidding me? All right, man.
Child. I'm visiting my nan and grandad.
The President. Okay.
Yes.
Child. What is your favorite rose in the Rose Garden?
The President. My favorite rose is the white rose. And the reason that's my favorite rose is that that's the rose I always give my wife: the white rose.
Folks, I'm keeping you a long, long time. And I promise I'll answer some questions back here. But let me just say toyou know, your mommy and daddies are doing really important work, for real.
And you know, in America, you're allowed to have really different points of view. You can really disagree on which direction you think as youthat we should take the country, whether we should be spending money on this program or that program, or we should be dealing with one country or another.
But in the past, we've always, at the end of the day, come together. We've always come together. And so the most important thing to remember is that
Now, let meyou know, America is the most unusual country in the world and wefor you little kids, ""unique""meaning there's not any other country like it. Most countries become countries because they are all the same religion or they're all the same ethnicity or they all have the same backgrounds. They're allall very similar.
But America is the only country that was built on an idea. And no matter how young you are, I hope you remember the idea. And that is that we're based not on where we live, not the geography. We're based on this ideaand this is true. It says: We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men and womenall men and women are created equal, endowed by their Creator, endowed by God, with certain inalienable rightsmeaning rights that they justthey have just because they're born. And those rights are lifeto have a good life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
No other country is based on that idea. No other country in the world. That's what makes us so special. And that's what makes us the envy of the world.
And I tell you, your moms and dadsboth in the press, as well as in governmentthey allow us to be able to make it work. We've never completely reached our goal, but we've never walked away from it.
So remember, in America, you should be able to do anything. You can accomplish anything. And there's an awful lot of people who have become very, very, very consequential and done incredible things for America because we afford them an access to an education, we afford them the access to be able to do neat things.
So thank you, thank you, thank you. I can see everybody is going: ""Slow it up, Biden. We better get thisget back to work.""
But thank you, thank you, thank you.
I wish I could take more of your questions. But I[applause]I'm going to say hi back here. Thank you. [Laughter]
Thank you, thank you, thank you. Appreciate it.
[The President addressed another group of children as follows.]
Hey, guys. I didn't asklet you guys ask me any question. What do you
Child. I'm Glen. And what are you going to do to ensure thethe health care and money for the employees of the White House?
The President. What am I going to do to make sure we have health care for the employees of the White House? We're going to make sure that we tell the American people what we're doing and why everybodyif everybody paid their fair share in taxes, the superwealthylike regular people pay their fair sharewe can easily afford this.
You know, we have a thousand billionaires in America. They only pay 8 percent of their taxes. Your moms and dad pay 20, 25 percent on their taxes. They don't make anywhere near that. So we've just got to make sure everybody pays their fair share.
And we can do all these things. We can do them well.
Yes, honey.
Child. First, what's your favorite part about being President? And can I have a handshake?
The President. My favorite part about being President is doing what I'm doing right now, getting to look the American people in the eye and hear what's on their mind. I really mean it. That's my favorite part of being President.
Yes, honey.
Child. What's your favorite room in the White House?
And can I havealso have a handshake? [Laughter]
The President. My favorite room in the White House is the room that's off the bedroom, where II made it into a study where I'm able to go in there and write my speeches and do a lot of things very quietly.
And I also like that little place called the Oval Office. That's a pretty neat place too.
Okay? Thank you, man.
What's your question, honey?
Child. When you became President, did it take you a while to get used to everyone crowding you and taking pictures?
The President. [Laughter] Well, yes, it did a little bit. But, see, I had an advantage when I became President. I had, for the previous 8I had for 8 years shown up every single day in the Oval Office as Vice President. So I got used to being with Barack and being in that circumstance, so it wasn't like all of a sudden, I was just in the national position. But it made it a little bit easier.
I'll take one more question here. Then I'm going to go across and ask for a question over here.
Child. Where were you born? [Laughter]
The President. That's a good question. I was born in a place called Scranton, Pennsylvania. Init's up init's north of Philadelphia. It's almost into New York. But Scranton, Pennsylvania, is where I was born.
I'll be right back.
Child. What do you do on a daily basis?
The President. What do I do on a daily basis? Well, that'swithout getting into the wholeevery morning, I have a meeting with what they call mythe National Security Councilthe people who are the people who collect all the information overnight, the secrets around the world, and fill me in on what they know is happening and not happening.
And so I sit with thisthe head of the CIA, the head of the military, and I do that.
Every morning I meet with my Chief of Staff to find out what the most important things are going on that day. And then, it depends. For example, today I'm going to beanyway, the schedule varies, butand I meet with my press team. And I talk to the press as well.
Yes.
Child. What's your favorite movie?
The President. My favorite movie was the new movie that was about that guy who flies jet planes. You know who I'm talking about?
Child. ""Top Gun""?
The President. ""Top Gun."" The
Child. Oh, yes, ""Top Gun: Maverick.""
The President. Did you seedid you see ""Top Gun: Maverick""? That's been my favorite movie I've seen this year.
Child. It's my favorite movie too. [Laughter] 
Child. Can I please have a fist bump?
Child. Mr. President, I heard you have to get back to the Oval Office. [Laughter]
The President. What was that?
Child. That's my sister.
The President. Oh, hi. How are you?
Child. Hi.
The President. Youwhat did you say? I didn't hear you.
Child. I said you have to get back to theI heard you had to get back to the Oval Office.
The President. And by the way, the one thing I thought when I got to be President, I'd get to give orders. [Laughter] But I take more orders than I ever did.
And you're right, babe. What's your name?
Child. Kathleen.
The President. Kathleen, what a beautiful name.
Kathleen is reminding me I've got to get back to the office. If I don't go, they're going to get the Secret Service working on me, so I'm going to be in trouble.
Well, thank you all for taking the time. I appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2023-04-26 00:00:00,Remarks at a State Dinner Honoring President Yoon Suk Yeol of South Korea,"
President Biden. Good evening, everyone. Please, have a seat.
Welcome to the White House. Jill and I are honored to have you here tonight to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the alliance between the Republic of Korea and the United States. And to President Yoon and Mrs. Kim, thank you for making the journey. We're delighted to have you here.
I believe this visit tonight has brought two nations even closer together. Yesterday evening, President Yoon and Mrs. Kim joined Jill and me at the Korean veterans war memorial. And we walked past the solders standing in steelthere were steel carvings and standing sentinel, and read the names of the fallen etched in the granite.
And, as many of you know, at the end of the memorial, there's an engraving that reads: ""Our Nation honors her sons and daughters who answered the call to defend a country they never knew and a people they never met."" It's a solemn reminder that our alliance was born out of not shared borders, but needshared beliefsa belief in democracy, liberty, security, and above all, a mutual belief in freedom.
A little over 70 years ago, Korean and American troops stood together for those beliefs, serving and sacrificing so that children in both our countries might have a better future. And it's a future we're living today.
The way the Korean people have transformed your country, Mr. President, through courage and hard work is one of the most prosperousit's one of the most prosperous and respected nations in the worldis testament to the boundless possibilities our people can achieve when we do it together. And we know that our work is not yet done.
Today, it's our duty to answer the call, that call to make the world better for those who will come after us. You know, this visit is about reaffirming all that unites our two nations. It's about a commitment to bear one another's concerns and listen to each other's dreams that allows us to overcome every difficulty and with great determination.
That allows us to furtherto move further and faster in space, cyber, technology, and in all the areas that matter most to our future. And that allows us to build, build a world that is worthy of our highest hopes and a world that we want for our own children and grandchildren.
We stand at an inflection pointmany of you have heard me say beforewhere the decisions we make now are going to determine the course of our future for decades to come.
But I've never been more optimisticand I mean thatI've never been more optimistic about our nations and what we can achieve together if we continue to work together as allies and as friends.
So please join meand I'm looking for mysomething to toast with here. [Laughter]
[At this point, President Biden was handed a wine glass by a White House aide.]
Thank you so much.
So please join me: To our partnership, to our people, to possibilities, and to the future the Republic of Korea and the United States that we'll create together. May we do it together for another 170 years.
[President Biden offered a toast.]
President Yoon. Mr. President, Dr. Biden, esteemed guests, and supporters of the R.O.K.-U.S. alliance, thank you for your warm welcome. Each of you at this magnificent and wonderful state dinner today is a reliable stakeholder and sponsor of the R.O.K.-U.S. alliance, which is one of the greatest in the history.
Mr. President, allow me to quote an Irish poet of yours. [Laughter] Seamus Heaney once wrote, ""Behavior that's admired is the path to power among people everywhere."" We admire sacrifices and actions of those who have propped up the R.O.K.-U.S. alliance for the past seven decades, have come together to forge a strong alliance in action, moving toward the future.
The seeds of the R.O.K.-U.S. alliance, sown in the ruins of the Korean war, have steadfastly grown over the past 70 years to form a rich and dense forest. The Republic of Korea's unprecedented economic growth and dynamic democracy have always been rooted in the R.O.K.-U.S. alliance.
Today President Biden and I, together, celebrated the 70th anniversary of the R.O.K.-U.S. alliance and had in-depth discussions on ways to further deepen our partnership in the future. We've reaffirmed that our trust in the alliance and our willingness to closely work together going forward will remain ironclad.
The alliance will last another seven decades and beyond. And it will open endless opportunities to the future generations of our two countries.
And going forward, the R.O.K.-U.S. alliance will take on more roles and responsibilities in order to tackle the complex crisis of our times. We will together embrace the future of the alliance, undergirded by our shared core values of freedom, democracy, the rule of law, and human rights.
The alliance will not only ensure the security and prosperity of both countries, but also contribute to the peace and security in the Indo-Pacific and of the world. And those of you joining us here today are the main drivers for building such an alliance.
And there's an old sayingand, Mr. President, this one is also Irish[laughter]that goes: ""A good friend is like a four-leaf clover, hard to find and lucky to have."" Today will be remembered as a historic day where the R.O.K.-U.S. alliance, like a four-leaf clover, spreads its new roots wide beyond the glory of the past 70 years.
Now I ask you to join me in the toast. To our alliance, confidently marching toward the future. To our ironclad alliance.
[President Yoon offered a toast.]
President Biden. Very good.

And, David, thanks for that introduction. You knowI really mean it. It makes a difference in people's lives what we're doing and what you all are supporting.
And Dina Titus and Steve Horsford, two of the best Members of the Congress that I've ever worked with. [Applause] There you are.
And we have the attorney general here too. Folks, you knowAaron and State and local, Tribal leaders are here. Will the Tribal leaders stand up? Because I don't know how many are here. Because[applause]there you go, Chief. Good to see you, man. And by the way, it's Indian Nations. Indian Nations.
And I'm here to today to talk about an issue affecting every single American: your health care. And I want to first thank the health care workers in this room. In the best of times[applause]I really mean itin the best of times, you do the Lord's work, but over the last 3 years during the pandemic, you've literally risked your lives for the rest of us. Health care workers that put their lives on the line. And it matters. And Iit really, really matters.
And I think the American public is beginning to understand just how consequential you are. They're used to going to the doc, but they're not used to the doc going into a tough area to take care of them.
And we lost a million people, and we would have lost a lot fewer if we started earliernot because of the docs' decisions, but because of other decisions made.
Oh, wow, I didn't see you all up there. [Laughter]
[At this point, the President looked up at audience members in the balcony.]
Holy mackerel. Don't jump! [Laughter] Don't[laughter].
Well, all Americans deserve peace of mind that if illness strikes or they havean accident occurs in their family, they can get the care they need, but they can afford the care they need.
But the truth is, too many folks lie in bed at night staring at the ceiling wondering what they would do if something happened: if their spouse got a serious illness or if they got very sick, or if their child got sick, if something happens to them.
You know, I remember, we lived in aI was raised in a normal middle class home back in Delaware, a three-bedroom house with four kids and a grandpop living with us, a split-level home. And my bedroom was next to my mom and dad's. Myme and my three brothers, we had two sets of bunks. And you could tell when dad was restless.
I remember one nighttrue storyone night, my dadI could feel like he was rolling in bed because of the headboard would hit the side of the wall. And myand Ithe next morning, I asked mythis is the God's truthI asked my mom. I saidI was in, I thinka junior in high school. I said, ""What's the matter with dad?"" She said: ""He justwe just lost our insurance. His business is no longer going to cover insurance for their employees.""
It was a consequential decision. It affected my dad and would have affectedif any one of us had gotten really sick, what happens? Do you have to sell the house? Do you have to make some kind of sacrifice that exceeds what is actually reasonable?
And it's about your dignity. You know, do you have enough insurance? Can you afford these medical bills? Can you getif it gets bad enough, do you have to do something drastic in order to pay for it?
And for seniors on fixed income, who often need expensive medications to stay healthy, the constant question is, can they pay for their medications? Can they pay the bills without giving up the important elements of their lives? Because the bottom line is, at the end of the month, do you have enough to pay all that you need and take care of the exigencies that occur?
And it's not just the elderly. It's almost every family out there. It's not just your health, it's about your dignity. It's about your security.
That's why my administration is focused intenselyintenselyon getting more people affordable health care by lowering prescription drug costs and giving families just a little bitas my dad would say, just a little bit of breathing room.
We passed the historic laws to get that done. And now we're moving quickly to implement those laws so people can feel the effects of what we did. We passed them last year, but they didn't take effect until January.
The first thing we did was to help people who were truly struggling to gain access to affordable health care through the Affordable Health Care Act, and thator better known as Obamacare.
I signed a Rescue Plan that increased the coverage and lowered prices for affordable health care, saving millions of people about $800 a year. My new budget[applause]. And my new budget for this year makes that permanent.
Almost 100,000 Nevadans get their health care through the Affordable Health Care Act. And 300,000 have coverage because of expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Health Care Act.
Unfortunately, my MAGAand by the way, I mean it sincerelythis is not a broad criticism of all Republicans. This is not your father's Republican Party. This is a different breed of cat now that's in charge.
No, but Ibut thinkthink about it. You know, I knew a lot of good Republicans who represented this State as Senators. They were friends. We disagreed. But they hadthey were conservative Republicans. But these MAGA Republicans, they're a differentthey're just different. They continue to be determined to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
And you know, it's hard to believe, but they've already voted to change or get rid of the Affordable Care Act, since it passed, 50 timesfive-zero. They failed every time.
And the one thing I want you to know about the Affordable Care Act is thatthe way for people who have preexisting conditions to get health care. If you have a preexisting condition and you can't afford your health careprivate plans, you do not get coverage anywhere. And this is the only outfitif in fact you do away with the Affordable Care Actif you haveif you have a preexisting condition, you don't get coverage otherwise.
If MAGA Republicans had their way, as many as a hundred million people with preexisting conditions would lose their protection. That's a fact.
And, folks, look, the Affordable Health Care Act is also a means by which millions of hard-working Americans have access to preventative care like cancer screenings.
MAGA Republicans put that at risk as well. And nearly 40 million Americans would be in danger of losing coverage completely if they were to succeed.
We're making health care more affordable in other ways as well. Last year, I proposed a piece of legislation called the Inflation Reduction Act, which I couldwe got[applause]we got a lot of things done bipartisanly. This one wasthere was not any support on the other team at all.
But the result of the law is that seniors on Medicare get common vaccines for things like tetanus, whooping cough, shinglesthey get them for free now. It used to cost them up to $200 per shot, average $100 per shot.
The new data released today shows that if our plan had been in place in 2021, three-point-million3.4 million seniors, including 24,000 Nevadan seniors, would have saved an average of $70.
You know, America spends more on prescription drugs than any advanced nation on Earthmore than any advanced nation on Earth. You name the drug you have to take, and I can take you to France and get it to you a hell of a lot cheaperto Canada, England, throughout Europe. It's not fair.
But after decades of trying to take on Big Pharma, we finally, finally won.
Now, instead of paying whatever the drug company wants to charge you, MedicareMedicare will be able to negotiate prices. Medicare provides[applause]we'll drive down prices because we give Medicare the powerthe same power that the Department of Veterans Affairs has. They can negotiate what they're going to pay for whatever drugs they're prescribing to theirto the military.
Well, I know many of you are health care professionals. You understand this better than anybody else.
For example, insulin was invented a hundred years ago. And the guy who invented it decided not to patent it because he wanted it to be available. It only costs $10 a vial to make$10 a vial. If you count everything, expand it, you could sayyou get up to 13 bucks if you talk about packaging, shipping, and the rest. And guess what? They're being charged hundreds of dollars a vial.
So, beginning January 1 of this year, even though we passed the law last yearit wasn't until January 1I kept telling people it was comingwe capped the cost of insulin at $35[applause]$35 for seniors on Medicare.
And, folks, if it had been in effect in 2020, nearly 11,000 Nevada seniors would have saved an average of $439 on their insulin.
But I've been calling on my colleagues to cap the cost, though, for everyone, you know, including 200,000 children who have type 1 diabetes who need insulin every day to stay alive.
I was doing a town hall meeting in Northern Virginia last year, and a woman stood upa very sophisticated ladyand she said: ""I have two girls. They both have type 1 diabetes."" And she said: ""And I can't affordI can't afford it. So what we have to dowe have to ration the insulin between them."" Talk about being deprived of your dignity.
Imagine looking at your child knowing if they don't get the insulin, their life is literally in danger. And you've got to stand there and not know what to do.
Folks, my budget is going to require it.
And guess what? The good news is that Eli Lilly, the biggest insulin maker in the United States of America, announced that they're going to answer my call and they're going to make thethis insulin available to everyone in America for $35.
And yesterday Novodisk [Novo Nordisk; White House correction], another drugmaker, announced they're cutting their price of insulin as well.
Look, folks, another aspect of the Inflation Reduction Actand it's a fancy-sounding phrase, but isthe drug companies that raise prices faster thanfaster thaninflation have to pay back the difference to Medicare.
So, if they're raising the price on insulinand Medicareand you have the circumstance where the inflation is up 4 percent and they increase it 12 percent or 15 percent, they have to pay the difference to Medicare.
Yesterday I learned that, last quarter, drug companies hiked the prices for 27 drugs that are on the market above the new limit. Now those manufacturers are going to have to pay the difference back to Medicare.
As a result, the Department of Health and Human Services estimates this will makecopays for those drugs will be as much as $390 cheaper for seniors. Look, it's going to change the way drugs are priced and lower the costs for seniors long-term.
And it's equally consequential to me that, as many of you in this room know, we're capping out-of-pocket drug expenses for seniors on Medicare at a maximum of $2,000 a year, beginning next year.
Now, but right now[applause]. Right now, we haveregardless of how much they cumulatively are paying for all of the drugs they need.
And now it's capped atbecause I've beenmy family has been deeply involved, as a consequence of cancer and my son dying of stagemy son dying of stage 3 glioblastoma because he was exposed to those burn pits for a year in Iraq. And myanyway, you allhow many here have had you or a family member be diagnosed with cancer? Raise your hand.
It's probably, as the docs know, the most devastating word they can tell a patient. You've got a serious heart disease, you may die; that's worrisome. More people die of heart disease than they do from cancer. But cancer scares the living hell out of every single person.
Well, folks, you know, a lot of those drugs now that are available, that are very helpfuland by the way, I've declared war on cancer. We've set up[applause]no, I really have. I've gotten $5 billion for cancer research through NIH, like we did through the Defense Department for special weapons systemsthe same system.
But here's the deal: Some people are paying about 10,000, 12-, 14,000 dollars a year for expensive treatments like cancer drugs. It's going to give seniors certain peace of mind, because no matter how much they payno matter how much they paythey're not going tohow much the bills are, they'll never have to pay more than $2,000 a year for all the drugs they consume. It changes the peace of mind people have.
And guess what? It's going to save seniors money. It's also going to save the Government money. And my Republican friends say, ""When are you going to cut taxes for the wealthy?"" I said, ""No, I've got a better way of saving money."" [Laughter] Not a joke.
If in fact you limit the amount of money that can be charged to reasonable prices by the drug companies, you know how much we'll save this year? A hundred and sixty billion dollars$160 billion. Why? Because it's $160 billion less they have to pay out to provide the drugs for the seniors. So it's not only the right thing to do, it is a conservative thing to do in terms of cutting the Federal budget.
But here's the deal. As I've said, this is not your father's Republican Party. The MAGA Republicans in Congress don't think any of this is a good idea. They think Big Pharma should be able to make the exorbitant profits, at the expense of the American people, they've been making.
And I want to repeal thethey want to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act, roll back savings for seniors, add to the deficit another $1.6 billion, and continue to line the pockets of Big Pharma. Look, I'm a capitalist. I wantif you can go out and make a lot of money, go make the money. Just pay your fair share. Justjust your fair share. No, for real.
I have no problems with a company making reasonable profits, but, my Lord, not on the backs of working families and seniors. And this is reallywhen it gets down to it, it's about fairnessfairness and decency and providing people with some dignity.
Last week, I released my budget. I met, by the wayand I apologize to the press that's here; they're tired of hearing me say thisI met with the new Speaker of the House. He saidhe is threatening that we're going to let the Federal debt not get paid and put us in turmoil. We've never done that in American history. And the debt is an accumulation of debt over 200 years. That's the debt we're talking about.
And I want to layI said: ""Look, I'll lay out clearly what we support. I'll lay out my budget on March the 9th; you lay out your budget, and we'll negotiate. We'll negotiate.""
Well, you know, my dad used to have an expression, for real. He'd say, ""Joey""when someone would say, ""I'll tell you what I value,"" he'd say: ""Don't tell me what you value. Show me your budget, and I'll tell you what you value."" Show me your budget. No, really. Think about.
My budget takes steps to lift the burden on seniors and hard-working Americans so at the end of the month, after busting their necks their whole lives, they have a little bit left over. That's what it used to be at our kitchen table: At the end of the month, is there anything left? [Inaudible]pay anything, do you have a little bit of room?
And, again, it's about fairness, and it's about your dignity. I value everyone having a decent shot. My Republican colleagues now in the House of Representatives, I think it's fair to saynot every one of them, but most of themare now at a point where they have a very different value set.
We're strengthening Medicare and Social Security instead of threatening to eliminate them, and the MAGA Republicans that are in Congress wantare threatening to do.
You know, when I didI don't know whether you saw the State of the Union, but it was kind of a fascinating thing. [Applause] No, no, I didn't say it for that reason. I was a Senator a long time. I'm used to dealing with and speaking to the Congress and the Senate. And so I'm comfortable when I'm doing them.
When I was standing up there before all the Members of the House and the Senate, and I talked aboutI read the programs which some of their leaders have put forward to, in fact, cut Social Security and cut Medicare.
And the gentlelady, as they say, from Georgiain the mountains of Georgia[laughter]stood up and yelled: ""Liar! Liar!"" And then that generatedlast time somebody did that, by the way, they got censured. [Laughter] Butno, I'm not joking.
But here's what happened. And then another half a dozen yelled, ""Liar! Liar! We're not going to do that."" I said, ""Oh""you mayif you remember, I said, ""Oh, you're not going to cut Social Security and Medicare?"" [Laughter] And they said, ""We're not going to""and so the whole groupI said: ""Everybody who's not going to cut Social Security and Medicare, stand up."" And they stood up and hollered. Well, they're all on film. [Laughter]
I hope it's true. I hope they've gotten there, but I'll believe it when I see it.
Look, you paid for Social Security from the time you got your first check when you were 16 years old, working as a lifeguard or something. Okay? And I'm determined to protect them both. There's ways to protect them without cutting them.
Look, let me close with this. You know, let's finish the job. Let's protect the lower prescription drug costs for everyone. Let's expand health care for more people to get care. Let's keep building the economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not from the top down.
And by the way, when that happenswhen the middle does well and the bottom risesthe wealthy still do very, very well. And no oneI commit to you, and I committed to this when I got electedwhen I was running: No one making less than $400,000 will see a penny in Federal taxes raised as long as I'm President of the United States of America.
But lookbut, again, it's about just paying a fair share.
When I got elected, there wereI think it was sixdon't hold me to the exact number690 billionaires in America. There's now a thousand. You know what the average Federal tax they pay is? T-h-r-e-e percent. Three. They pay a lower tax rate than the custodians in this building. They pay a lower tax rate than any of you, basically.
And so it's just not fair. I think you should be able to be a billionaire if you can earn it, but just pay your fair share. Just pay something.
And by the way, you know everybody said, well, how was I able to have these new programs and still cut the deficit $1.7 trillion the last 2 years?
Well, it's prettypretty straightforward. There were 550 companies of the Fortune 500 that made $40 billion that didn't pay a penny in taxzero, nothingin taxes. So I said theyou know, outrageous. And we got votes for it. I said they ought to pay a minimum of 15 percent. Fifteen percent. That's less than you all pay. And guess what? It allowed me to cut the deficit.
So, folks, this is about just basic fairness and decency. There's nothing radical about what I'm proposing. And if you look at the polling data, it's overwhelmingly popular what we've proposed. As a matter of fact, it's a hell of a lot more popular than I am. [Laughter] But I'm serious.
So Ithis is no time to turn around. Look, what the American people understandablya lot of people have lost faith in Government for a lot of reasons. And here's the deal: We've promised these things, and they haven't seen it.
I don't know whether you've been surprised, but the number of people who have come up to me after January 1 saying: ""I cutyou cut my insulin costs. Thirty-five dollars."" Like, ""I didn't believe Government would really do it."" But there's a lot more coming. A lot more coming.
And, again, let me end by thanking the medical people that are here and the students. It really matters. It really, really, really matters.
And all of you have to do, like many people in this audience have been consumersignificant consumer of health care. My son spent 18 months knowing he was dying in the hospital. And the docs and nurses just changed itchanged it. They made itthey took care of him.
My wife and daughter were killed in a trucking accident. My two boys were expected not to live. You guys saved them, and you saved their sanity as well. So I think that, you know, we vastly underestimate and you underestimate the psychological impact you have on people, not just the medical impact you have on them. So I'm here to say thank you, thank you, thank you.
And, folks, let's remember: We forget, we are the United States of America, and there's nothingnothingbeyond our capacity if we work together. So let's work together.
God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.

2023-03-14 00:00:00,"Remarks at a Democratic National Committee Reception in Las Vegas, Nevada","
The President. Thank you, Jess. Well, thanks. Thank you very much for tonight. I'm only here because of your birthday. [Laughter] That's the reason I came.
You know, I want to thank two great friends: Dina Titus, who's one ofI'vewe've been working together since[applause]for well over 25 years. She started when she was 5. So it's a[laughter]so thank you, Dina, for everything you've done.
And you know, you have aI predict a guy you're going to see being a leading role in Democratic politics nationally, and he's already off to a good start: Steven Horsford is a great guy. No, you really are. He won in spite of the fact that I supported him. [Laughter]
And thank you all for being here. I know that Susie Lee and Catherine MastoCortez Masto, and Jacky Rosen wanted to be here, but they have some votes coming up in the United States Senate. Andtomorrow is an important vote on one of our Ambassadors.
And I'm here for a simple reason: to say thank you. And I mean it sincerely. Thank you for all your help.
We made some historic progress in the last 2 years. We've created 12 million new jobs. Weremember where we started here. We started with an enormous deficit, an enormouswe were in a hole, and we weren'teverybody was wondering how in God's name we're going to get out of it. But we ended up creating 12 million brandnew jobs, more than any President has created in 4 years[inaudible].
And it's because of the help. No, I'm not joking. It's because of your delegation and because of the peoplethe Democrats stood together. And you know, inflation is still a problem, but it's down 30 percent since the summer. I think we're going to lick it.
And you know, everything from NATO and Ukraine has been a real push. It's cost a lot of money. And it's alsobut it's the right thing to do. There areyou know, weI don't think we have a choice. Never do we have 185,000 people invade another country in Europe since World War II. And it'slots at stake.
And by the way, during this period of time, we passed a lot of legislation that's helped an awful lot of States and the community. We've created 800,000 new manufacturing jobs. Where in the hell is it written that says that we no longerwe can no longer lead the world in manufacturing? I don't buy it. I don't buy it.
And, folks, look, you know, we passed an awful lot of legislation. Now, I was told that we wouldn't be able to get any bipartisan help. Well, on some of the big things, we didn't get any help. We hadneeded all Democrats to get it done. But we did get bipartisan help on the infrastructure bill.
The infrastructurewell, how in God's name can you lead the world as the mostthe most powerful economic force in the world and have a second-rate infrastructure? Not a joke. How do you do that? We used to be number one in the world; now we rank number eight in the world. And whywhat's that all about?
A lot of you are successful business women and men. Where are you going to build a factory? Where are you going to make your businessunless you have access to rail, ports, airports, et cetera? It's a big deal. And so we're going to make a lot of headway.
If we did nothing but just, over the next 2 years, implement what we've donewe're talking about a bill that's passed that's 1 trillion 200 billion dollars. It's going to transform America in a significant way. No, forno kidding. It's a fact.
And so there's a lot else we've done. For example, we passed the Inflation Reduction Act. Well, that had a couple of important provisions in that act, not least of which was wefor the first time, we put the money in to deal with a thing called global warming.
Of course, I was told by our friends there is no global warming. [Laughter] Well, guess what? We better damn well get it straight or you're not getting any water to drink out of the Colorado River. Not a joke.
Audience member. No joke.
The President. No, not a joke. This is serious stuff. It's the single most dire consequence. If we don't keep it below 1.5 degrees Celsius over thebenot go above thatwe're going to damn our children to a circumstance that is going to be the only truly existential threat underother than nuclear war.
I've traveled out here, out in the West, withsince I've been President, with every Governor who's been in trouble. And I've flown in a helicopter over more area that has been burned to the ground than the entire State of Marylandthan the entire State of Maryland.
And they tell me there's no global warming? Well, I don't know where everybody has been, but people are waking up to it. Well, we passed the $368 billion global warming bill, the single most consequential environmental law ever, ever passed. And guess what? Our friends[applause].
And by the way, I should have said this at the outset: This is not your father's Republican Party. It's a different deal. And by the way, there a lot of good Republicans from this State that I worked with over the years and from every other State. But this is not the same deal. These are a different breed of cat, as my mom would say.
And the fact of the matter is that they want to undo even the bipartisan things we got done. They want to undo them now. They want to cut the entire discretionary budget by 20 percent across the board.
They want tothey'reand the threat I'm being told you'veread in the paper, they're telling me that unless I vote the way they want and I go along with their budget, they're not going to, in fact, pay our debts. We're going to, for the first time in American history, renege on the Federal debt.
The Federal debt is accumulated over 200 years. That's the debt we're talking about. And it's large; it's $3 trillionor $300 trillion$31 trillion, excuse me.
And guess what though? We've never failed to pay it. And the interest is accumulated, and we've continued to pay it. If we ever are going to renege on it, we're going to see an absolute economic crisis not only here, but worldwide. And it's one thing if they want to negotiatebut at any rate, I shouldn't get going on this. [Laughter]
But look, onemy dad used to have an expression. He'dsomeone would say, ""Let me tell you what I value, Joe."" And his name was Joe. ""Let me tell you what I value."" And I wouldhe would turn and say: ""Don't. Show me your budget. Don't tell me what your value. Show me your budget. I'll tell you what you value."" I'm serious. Think about it. ""I'll tell you what you value.""
Well, you know, I can tell you what we value as Democrats: that we want to grow the economy, not trickle-down economics. It hadn't worked very well for middle class folks. I want to build it from the middle out, the bottom up. When that occurs, the wealthy do very well, the poor have a chance, and the middle class make it. And sowhat wewhere the middle class is doing well now, and we're beginning to make some real progress.
But you know, one of the things thatfor example, we passed the billI've been fighting for this for a long timeback in the Harry Reid days, he was fighting for it too. And that is tothe only outfitwe pay the highest drug prices of any advanced nation in the world. The highest in the world. I'm not joking. You can buy whatever drug you need that's consequential. You can go to Spain, France. You can getCanadaget it a hell of a lot cheaper.
And so one of the things we wanted to do is, we wanted to change that so that we'reand so weI introduced the inflectionexcuse methe Reduction Act that has worked for a while that took on Big Pharma. This time we won.
And, for example, for the first time, Medicare can negotiate drug prices. Negotiate drug prices. Not only is it going to save billions of dollars in prescription drug bills for people, but it's going to reduce the Federal deficit by $180 billion this year, because that's $180 billion less that Medicare has to pay out to people on Medicare.
And so we're in a situation wherefor example, I was in Northern Virginia about this timeno, it wasI guess it was late spring last year. And a woman stood up. I was doing a town meeting. And she said, ""I have two daughters who have type 2 diabetes, and I need insulin. It's costing me about""I think she said at the timeit varies in pricebut she said for the two of them it cost about $1,400 a month. She said: ""I don't have any insurance; I can't do it. I don't have any private insurance and nothing covers it, so we have to split thewe have to split the insulin.""
Ladies and gentlemen, talk about a parent being deprived of their dignity. Look at your child and know they need a drug that's available, they can't afford it, and look them in the eye knowing that they'reliterally, their very life depends on access to it.
Well, we passed the Inflation Reduction Act. We are now negotiating. And guess what? It costs $10 to manufacture the insulin for diabetes. Ten dollars. Counting everythingpackaging it, it can cost as much as $13. Well, guess what? You know what the most they can pay for itthey can charge for it now? Thirty-five dollars. We're making significant progress.
And you knowand if you notice, you had an awful lot of folks all of a sudden, like Eli Lilly, deciding they're only going to charge $35. And all the major drug companies are coming along. For example, Novartis has now reduced prices 75 percent. And by the way, you can buy that insulin in France for about $35, $40.
And so, you know, the American Rescue Plan, not one Republican voted for it. I signed it as soon as I got into office. That provided forthe Affordable Care Actfor a lot of poor folks who are on Medicaid, and they got an $800 break. So they get better medicine now, and it makes a big difference in their physical well-being and their lives, and better coverage, better prices. And the budget I've proposed this year makes that permanent.
And so, look, you know, these MAGA Republicans, they've tried 50 times to repeal that. Fiftytimes over the lastsince this passed under Obama. Fifty times to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
And alongyou know, folks, look, as I said, no one can deny there's climate change, but they want to get rid of the legislation. They've announced they want to get rid of the legislation in the House of Representatives.
And you knowand, by the way, every RepublicanMAGA Republican voted against it. When I say ""MAGA Republican,"" I mean the extreme Republicans who make up about 40 percent of the House Republican Caucus and party.
I've hadand I've committed I would not I say this to Mr. Greenspan. I'm not going to ever tell you the names, but thethere are eight senior Republicans, who are still in the United States Senate, who have come to me over the last 10 months to tell me they agree with me but they're afraid to vote with me.
If they vote with me, what will happen is, they will lose their primary. There'll be out of office. Not a lot of political courage, but it also is a reflection that they don't agree with what's going on.
And so, folks, look, for decades, not only have we led the world economically, we've been the best educated nation in the world. We've hadgreat universities in other countries that are even better than our universities during the 20th century. But we're the first nation in the world to say we're going to provide for 12 years of free education for everybody. It was the formula that moved us in a position to begin to have the strongest economy in the world, beginning in 1906 and '07, and working our way through.
Now, does anybody think if we were deciding to catch up, and a loteverybody has caught up with us, basically, around the world. If we were going to say, ""Well, whatwhat's the minimum education you think Americans need to compete in the 21st centurythe second quarter of 21st century?"" Do you think they'd say 12 years is enough?
Audience members. No!
The President. No, I mean, really not. It's a fact, it's not. Things have changed.
And so we all havemassive studies have been done by four of the great universities over the last 7 years. If you have a kid going to school at age 3, 4, and 5not daycare, schoolschoolit increases the prospect by 56 percent they'll go all the way through 12 years of school without difficulty and at least beacquire an apprenticeship or 2 years at community college.
And what'syou know, a lot of you are very successful businessmen. I met withwhen I was Vice President, and with the Secretary of Commerce, we hadat Barack's request, we wanted to meetwe met with the Fortune 500 CEOsmet with 320343 of them. And I asked them what do they need most. One at a time. I spentit was a 4-hour meeting. One at a time. And they said, ""A better educated workforce."" I said, ""I agree.""
But I come from the State of corporate America, Delaware. More corporations are incorporated in the State of Delaware than the entire rest of the Nation combined. And I got elected. I'm not anticorporation, but I got elected seven times Senator in that State, which was a red State when I began.
The point being that the DuPont Company used to be the eighth largest corporation in the world. Now it's much smaller comparedin the world. But when it bought a new enterprise, it educated his workers to how tofrom the technical side. Nocorporations aren't doing that anymore. They expect the public to provide that.
Welland I said, ""So whyif you guys agree you need a better educated public, whyworkforcewhy are you arguing against what I'm trying to get done in terms of increasing it?"" Many of you arehavehave taught, are teachers, or you have children who are teachers. You know the statistics. Any child who comes from a broken home, or mom or dad is a drug addict, or having real difficultyby the time they reach kindergarten or first grade, they will have heard 1 million fewer words spokenthe same word, but, I mean, they don't sit at the dinner table and have conversations. They don't have access.
And guess what? It shows that if you put a kidtheir brains are developing rapidly at this pointif you put them in a circumstance where they're exposed, they can do well. They can do well.
So, but what are these guys want to do? They want to cut access to educationthe new group. They want to cut Pell grants for pooryou have to be making less than 60 grand to have a Pell grant to get to college and a community college. They want to cut it. They want to cut it. They don't want to do anything about Trump's tax cut that was $2 trillion. It did not do very much except created a gigantic deficit.
More deficit was created under Donald Trump in 4 years. It increased the overall national debt by 22 percent. The overall on the 100200-year national debt.
And so, folks, there was a big choice coming up here. A big choice. What are we going to do? I doubt whether any of you believe that this present leadership in the Republican Party is one that reflects basic conservative, Republican values. Iand if there is, I haven't seen it, for real.
And so what this is all aboutand I guess, going back to my dadyou know, don't tell me what you value, show me your budget. Well, they want to cut their discretionary budget by 20 percent across the board. That's everything. That's everything.
I meanand I don't know if any of you watched the State of the Union, but it was a fascinating exercise. I always feel comfortable speaking before the Congress; I've done it my whole life. Not aI've only done it three times as President, as abut here's what happened. I said, you know, the Republicanthe leading Republicans ran on supporting candidates who agreed to cut Social Security and cut Medicare.
And the distinguished lady from Northfrom Georgia, who's from the mountains[laughter]started yelling: ""Liar! Liar! Liar!"" And about a half a dozen start yelling, ""Liar."" And I saidand then, that group said, ""We don't want to cut."" I said, ""All Republicans in this Chamber who don't want to cut Social Security or Medicare""fix it, but not cut it""raise your hand."" And they all stood in a big groupabout all of them. And I said, ""You're not going to cut it?"" They said, ""No."" I said, ""You're all on camera."" [Laughter] You're all on camera.
But, folks, you know, wewe'reyou know, what happened to those manufacturing jobs? Well, we went from incorporatingbringing in labor and jobs and exporting product, to exporting jobs and bringing in product. Why? Because all of a sudden, beginning about 23 years ago, major corporations in America said: ""I can go to Cambodia and get it done cheaper. I can go toI can go overseas and get it done cheaper with cheap labor.""
Like, for example, they're still in parts of Xinjiang Province in China, they have slave labor. For real. The Uyghurs. They get it done a hell of a lot cheaper.
Well, guess what? We changed that dynamic. We said we're going to import jobs and export product. And why I've went around the worldliterally around the world, not figurativelyliterally around the world and met with a group of the nations about wanting to invest in America.
And we used towe used to control, for example, thatwe invented the computer chip. We invented that little thing that you need for your automobiles, for cell phones. We made it, and we made it work. Well, guess what? We don't make it anymore. You remember when car prices went up so much in 2021? It's because they didn't have access to chips.
So we put together a CHIPS and Science Act. We used to developwe used towe used to invest 2 percent of our GDPour gross domestic productin research and development. We now invest 0.7 percent. Well, guess what? I said we've got to get more people manufacturing here, and we have to have chip manufacturing. Well, now we have a commitment of $300 billion of investment fromin America and around the world in the United States.
We're going to own it again, because I refuse to be the end of the supply chain. Most of you had never heard of a supplynever talked about a supply chain 3 years ago until, all of a sudden, you found out: ""The supply chain? What the hell is that?"" It means the basic product we need to build larger products coming from abroad. Well, now it's coming from the United States.
For example, out inIntelout just west of Columbus, Ohiothey're going to invest a total ofI think the number is $13 billion. No, excuse me, $20 billion in their first effort. And they're going to need to needand it's calledI call it the ""field of dreams."" There's twothere's a thousand acres out there that's being developed. They're going to build two of what they call fabs. They call the factories ""fabs."" It's going to take 7,000 construction people to build these fabs, and they're going to make union wages to do it.
And in addition to that, there's 5,000 jobs running the factories making the chips. You know what the average salary in those factories is going to be? A hundred and thirty thousand dollars. And you don't need a college degree for all of them; you need the training.
Soand there's $300 billion being invested over the next 10 years: Syracuse; Poughkeepsie, New York. Arizona. All around the world.
And think what's happened. It's happened here in parts of Nevada, but it's happened primarily in the Midwest. People have lost their sense of their self-worth. When you have a factory withemploying 2,000 people in a relatively small town in the Midwest, and all of a sudden it closes and goes overseas, you lose theso many people you know from the Midwest. How many of you heard them say: ""Imy son, daughter got a good education, but came to me and said, 'I can't say here, Mom. Can't stay here, Dad. There's no work. There's no work.'"" We hollowed out the area.
We're going to rebuild it. We're going to rebuild it in a massive way, and it's going tomay be good for business, and the wealthy are going to do very well, making a lot of money; the middle class are going to have a shot; and most importantly, the people who never had a shot are going to have a way up.
I'm talking too long, and I apologize for doing that. Because Iparticularly for some of you standing. My staff is over there going, ""Grrr."" [Laughter]
But, folks, lookwe have a real choice in this electionunrelated to meunrelated to mebetween the Democrats and Republicans and what they stand for and what they're about, in terms of what they want to get done and what they want to do, thethis new Republican Party, the new leadership in the
And by the way, you know, I met with the Speaker of the House. He's not a bad guy; he's a decent guy. And he sat with me and hehe said, ""Well, what are we going to do?"" I said, ""I'll tell you what. I'llsubmit my budget in detail on the 9th of March. You submit yours, and I'll negotiate. We'll sit down, and we'll see what we can do."" Because I'mand mythis present budget I introduced is going to reduce the debt another $3 trillion.
What they've introduced so far is going to increase the debt three-pointincrease it $3.7 trillion. So it's about a little bit of transparency in what we're doing.
And I haven't even talked about foreign policy; time won't permit. But the bottom line is: These guys are talking about not funding so many pieces of our foreign policy. So many pieces.
One of the things I'm proud to say: I'mand I can say it because other world leaders have said it about me. And I've been able to hold NATO together. NATO was about to split[inaudible].
A couple of you said you met with theyou heard I was with the Prime Minister of Australia. We just put together a thing called AUKUS, meaning we're going to allow Australia to have nuclear power. No nuclear weapons, but nuclear-powered submarines. And it's going to change the entire Indian Ocean and the South China Sea. It's going to doso there's so much we can do.
I amhave never been somore optimistic about the chances for America to take back the standard we had where the rest of the world looks to us and we look to them, because we arewe areas Madeleine Albright said, the essential nation.
I'll conclude with a quick story. I went to the first what they call G-7 meetings, the largest democracies in the world. And it was in Londonexcuse me, it was in England. And it was down on the south side of England, on the water. And we sat down for the first meeting. And I looked and I said, ""America is back.""
And Macron looked at me and said, ""For how long?"" ""For how long?"" And then the Chancellor of Germany looked at me and said: ""We trust you. But how long can you getcan we keep what you're doing?"" And I said, ""Yes.""
And then the Primethe Chancellor of Germany said, ""What would you think, Mr. President, if you went to bed tonight here in Great Britain, you woke up the next morning and found out that a thousand people have stormed the Parliament, broken down the doors of the House of Commons, killed several police officers, threatened the rest of the Parliament to overturn a parliamentary decision or an election?""
Think about it. What would we think if we read that tomorrow, if we read that the same thing happened in Paris or the same thing happened in other capitals of the world?
Well, the world looked and saw that happen here. Our democracy is literally at stake. When I made that speech early on and I said, in 2022, we were going towe were going to come close to winning, no one ever has kept that many seats in an off-year. Okay? And everybody thought I was nuts.
It'sbecause I'd gone around the country. And I made a speech atin Philadelphia. And I said democracy is at risk and then laid out why. Sixty-two percent of the American people thought it was at risk. Sixty-two percent.
And now you turn on the television todayas I got here on Air Force One, I'm watchingand you got western Oregon deciding they're going to secede and become part of Idaho. What in the hell is going on? [Laughter] Idaho is a beautiful State. But no, I'm serious. There's actuallythey've actually moved hard. They've passed resolutions in the State to do that.
So there's so much at stake, but there's so much opportunity. We have to remember one thing: We're the United States of America. There's nothingI mean thisnothing beyond our capacity if we do it together. Nothing. Nothing.
Am Iasked me what I wanted to do to change the attitude of the American people, I said, ""Cure cancer."" And they looked at me""Why?"" Because Americans began to lose faith that we can do big things. Well, guess what? I got $5 billion, and we're about to cure some cancers. No, I mean it.
So, anywayI know. I know. He's lookingthe boss is looking for a microphone. Go ahead. Shut it down, man. [Laughter] Thank you, thank you, thank you. Appreciate it.

2023-03-14 00:00:00,"Remarks on Gun Violence Prevention Efforts in Monterey Park, California","
Good afternoon. Thank you. Thank you. Please have a seat, if you have one. [Laughter]
Good afternoon. Saturday, January 21, 2023, Lunar New Year, a time to enjoy. A ballroom dance studio, a place of happiness, friendship, and belonging. People across backgrounds and generations celebrating their cultural roots and bonding through ballroom song and dance.
A place of refuge where immigrants have lived for years, supported new immigrants who just arrived, becoming not just friends, but family.
But as we all saw, a day of festivity and light turned into a day of fear and darkness. A holiday of hope and possibilities marked by horror and pain. Vibrant dances and music replaced by vigils and memorials. Eleven souls taken. Nine injured. Private mourning made public.
That sense of safety shattered. Survivors who will always carry the physical and emotional scars. Families left behind who will never be the same.
One of the worst mass shootings in California history. A tragedy that has pierced the soul of this Nation, here in Monterey Park, in the San Gabriel Valley, the heart of the Asian American community.
My dear friend Judy Chu, former mayor of Monterey Park and your Congresswoman and chair of Congressional Asian Pacific Caucus [Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus; White House correction]. Senator Alex Padilla, a champion for this community and the entire State. My good friend, Supervisor Hilda Solis, and all elected officials, law enforcement, first responders, faith leaders, community members all here today.
You've shown up for this community, and I know you always will.
To the families of victims who spend timeI get a chance to meet with today and whom Vice President Harris spent time with a few weeks ago, I'm here on behalf of the American people to mourn with you, to pray with you, to let you know you're loved and not alone.
Every case is different, but I know what it's like. I know what it's like to get that call. I know what it's like to be told. I know what it's like to lose a loved one so suddenly. It's like losing a piece of your soul. It's like a black hole in your chest you feel like you're being sucked into.
Suffocating, hardly able to breath. The anger. The pain. The depths of the loss so profound it's hard to explain. The suddenness tends to magnify the grief.
And, as time passes, the shock and numbness slowly make way for the sobering reality of their absence. That empty chair at the dinner table. The birthdays, the anniversaries, the holidays without them.
Everyday things, small things, the detail you miss the most. The scent when you open that closet door. The park you go by that you used to stroll in. The morning tea you shared together. The bend of his smile. The perfect pitch of her laugh.
As Judy shared with me, this is a tight-knit community, with intergenerational households and deep reverence and respect for its elders. A community that's opened its heart and its homes to friends and neighbors and stood strong throughout the pandemic as anti-Asian hate crimes rose. A community that in the face of horrific tragedy has become a symbol of hope and resilience, pushing forward together, healing together.
People from all faiths and backgrounds rallying to show their love and support, raising money for funeral costs and memorials, providing counseling and translation services to the victims' families. Providing and proving that even with heavy hearts we have unbreakable spirits.
As a nation, we remember them: immigrants from China, the Philippines, Vietnam, Taiwan, all of whom found a home in America.
Mr. Ma, age 72. A pillar of the community. A beloved manager and dance instructor at Star Ballroom. He walked patrons to their cars at night. Helped new immigrants find jobs. His children and grandchildren will carry on his legacy in the spirit of one of his favorite Chinese proverbs, ""Cherish the people in front of you."" Cherish the people in front of you.
Andy Kao, 72. ""Mr. Nice"" for his kindness, his positivity, his infectious smile. A free spirit always ready to lend a helping hand. He died shielding his dance partner.
Xiujuan Yu, 57. Devoted mom, wife, sister. A woman of faith. Always there to help others bringing food and newspapers to family members who had trouble walking. Alwaysalways working tirelessly with her husband to build a future for their three children.
Nancy Jian, 62. Known as ""Sister Sunshine."" She loved to play cards, piano, and a weekly volleyball game. Always sharing her homegrown plants and vegetables with neighbors and friends. A dedicated mom, married nearly 40 years, a husband and wife who were always together, even in their last dance.
Valentino Alvero, 68 years old. A servant of God. Life of the party. Storyteller who made the whole room laugh. A man devoted to his children and his grandchildren.
Mymy Nhan, 65. Bedrock of her family and friends. Eternal optimist. Avid dancer who'd visit the studio every weekend, often leaving snacks behind for her classmates. She radiated positive energy through her laughter, her kind words, and her smile.
Muoi Dai Ung, 67. Refugee, community builder, cherished friend, known for her kindness, her sweetness, her generosity. Her beloved family, the center of her world.
Diana Tom, 70 years old. Devoted daughter, wife, mother, grandmother who loved to sing karaoke. A giver and an adventurer who loved to explore new foods and travel the world.
Charles Yau, 76. Grateful. Reflective. Believed in living to thelife to the fullest. He constantly showed his family and friends and showered them with warm words of encouragement, hope, and love.
Tau [Wen-Tau; White House correction] Yu, 64. A lifelong learner, he retired as a business manager and was pursuing a second career as a pharmacist while caring for his elder motherelderly mother. A man beloved by his wife, children, and friends for his compassion, his determination, and his wisdom.
Lily Li, 63. A matriarch with absolute strength, optimism, and grace. Her daughter wrote: ""Stolen is the grandmother whose granddaughter fell asleep many nights nestled between her loving arms. Taken away is the opportunity for her grandson to feel her love and warmth.""
All of them lived lives of love, sacrifice, and service for their families, for their community. They represent a bigger story of who we are as Americans, embodying the simple truth that our diversityour diversityis the strength of this Nation.
We saw that strength in Maria Liang, owner of Star Ballroom, who I want to thank for pouring her heart into creating a warm, welcome space to bring the community together, especially seniors.
And we saw that strength in Brandon Tsay, who met me at the airport, whom Jill and I have gotten to know. Twenty minutes after the rampage at Star Ballroom, Brandon saw the same shooter walk into his family's own dance studio just 2 miles away, pointing a gun at him. In an instant, he found the courage to act and wrestled the semiautomatic firearm away. Brandon saved lives. He protected the community.
At Half Moon Bay, just 2 days later[applause]you've got it. Brandon, stand up.
At Half Moon Bay, just 2 days later, we saw heroism from police officers, firefighters, and other first responders who rushed into the danger to save lives.
As many of you know, Jill and I invited Brandon as our guest at the State of the Union message because we wanted the country to know all of younot just Brandon, all of you. The character of this community. The faith you have in this community. The pride. We see acrosswe see it in you across all of American life.
Just this week, a film about resilience and power of the Asian American immigrant family made history at the Oscars, echoing the heart of so many in this community.
But we also hear a message we've heard too often, including 2 years ago this week, after the spa shooting at the Atlantain the Atlanta area: Enough. Do something.
We remember and mourn today, but I am here with you today to act.
Last year, after the mass shooting in Buffalo, New York, and Uvalde, Texas, I signed into law, after being in both places, the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the most significant gun safety law in almost 30 years. That was in addition to me signing more executive actions to reduce gun violence than any of my predecessors at this point in their Presidencies.
Today I'm announcing another Executive order that will accelerate and intensify this work to save more lives more quickly.
First, this Executive order helps keep firearms out of dangerous hands, as I continue to call on Congress to require background checks for all firearm sales. And in the meantime[applause]. In the meantime, my Executive order directs my Attorney General to take every lawful action possible to move us as close as we can to universal background checks without new legislation. I justit's just common sense to check whether someone is a felon, a domestic abuser, before they buy a gun.
The Executive order also expands public awareness campaigns about the ""red flag"" ordersthe lawswhich my son, when hebefore he diedattorney general of Delawarewas a great proponent of it and instituted it. So more parents, teachers, police officers, health providers, and counselors know how to flag for thea court that someone is exhibiting violent tendencies, threatening classmates, or experiencing suicidal thoughts that make them a danger to themselves and others and temporarily remove that person's access to firearms.
And it promotesthis Executive ordersafe storage for firearms, something every responsible gun owner agrees with.
The second thing it doesthe Executive order ramps up our efforts to hold the gun industry accountable. It's the only outfit you can't sue these days. It does that by calling out for an independent Government study that analyzes and exposes how gun manufacturers aggressively market firearms to civilians, especially minors, including by using military imagery.
And it directs the Attorney General to public releasepublicly release Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms inspection reports of firearms dealers who were cited for violation of the law. That way, policymakers can strengthen laws to crack down on those illegal gun dealers and the public can avoid purchasing from them.
Third, the Executive order improves Federal coordination to support victims, survivors, and their families and communities affected by mass shootings, the same way FEMA responds to your natural disasters in California and all around the Nation. And it will help folks recover and build after wildthatthey help folks recover and build after wildfires and superstorms and droughts.
For example, we need to provide more mental health support and grieffor grief and trauma and more financial assistance when a family loses the sole breadwinner or when a small business shuts down due to a lengthy shooting investigation.
There's more in this Executive order, but I'm not stopping there.
Last week, I laid out in my budget that we invest more in safer communities and expand access to mental health services for those affected by gun violence. Congressional Republicans should pass my budget instead of calling for cuts in these services or defunding the police or abolishing the FBI, as we hear from our MAGA Republican friends.
But let's be clear: None of this absolves Congress the responsibilityfrom the responsibility of acting to pass universal background checks, eliminate gun manufacturers' immunity from liability.
And I am determined once again to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. I led that fight into ban them in 1994. In the 10 years that law was in place, mass shootings went down. Our Republicans friends let it expire, and itand 10 years later, and mass shootings tripled since then. Tripled.
So let's finish the job. Ban assault weapons. Ban them again. Do it now. Enough. Do something. Do something big.
Folks, let me close with this. Scripture says, ""The Lord is near to the brokenhearted and saves the crushed in spirit."" A lot of us have been there.
As we gather here today, I know your hearts are broken, but I know your spirits are strong. And as you remember and heal, I know the light of your loved one is once again going to lead you forward.
It takes time. I tell everyoneat least it did with meit takes time. But I promise youI promise youthe day will come when the memory of your loved one brings a smile to your lips before it brings a tear to your eye. The tear will never fully go away. But when you had that smile firstto remembrance, that's when you knowthat's when you know you're going to make ityou're going to know you're going to make it.
And my prayer for all of you is that day will come sooner than later, but I promise you it will come.
God bless you all. I admire you so damn much. Thank you.

2023-03-13 00:00:00,"Remarks at a Democratic National Committee Reception in Rancho Santa Fe, California","
The President. Thank you. Thank you for the comment about the book, Allan. I appreciate it. And tell your wife I said, ""Thank you for all the preparation."" It's never easy. Everybody says, ""No problem."" You have to work like the devil to get it done. [Laughter]
And I want to thank all of you for not just the help, but for taking the time. Your time is more valuable than anything else. And thank you for doing this. I really mean it.
You know, I heard you had read the book. The book is ""Promise Me, Dad."" It's about my son. And my sonmy number-one son who should be the one standing here as President, not me. He was the attorney general in the State of Delaware.
And he volunteered to go with his unit to Iraq for a year. And he washe came back. He was near one of those burn pits. I was in and out of Iraq over 26 times, and thoseyou know the burn pits I'm talking about? Thosethey're 8 to 10 feet deep and the size of football fields that burn everything in it from combustibleanyway. And an awful lotjust like those firefighters, you know, on 9/11. Well, he came back. He went one of the fittest men in his unit, came back with stage four glioblastoma.
And I know a lot of you haveas you came through the linetalked to me about cancer and how important it was to deal with it. And there's nothing likeyou lose someone to cancer, it's like losing a piece of your soul, losing a part of you.
Andbut I hope you foundanyone who's had a lossthe thing that I found, which is that, you know, they neverit never goes away. It becomes part of you. And I find myself askingfor real, MomI find myself asking myself, in important decisions I have to make: ""What would Beau do? What would Beau do?""
And so thank you for acknowledging you read the book. And I want to thankyou know, and I'm not sure I rescued you from Sacramento, but thank you for being here, Senator. [Laughter]
And I also want to thank Scott Peters for being here. You know, I've served with an awful lot of Members of Congress. I served in the United States Senate for longer than I'd like to admit. I was proud to be in there for 36 years. And you can make distinctions among the people you serve with.
And the highest compliment I can give any member of thethat stands for public office is they have absolute integrity. Absolute integrity. This man has integrity from the tip of his shoes to the top of his brow. And it matters. It matters. You know[applause].
I mean this sincerely: You only havewhen you'rewhen you're in public life, you only have one thing for certain that you can offer, and that is: Are you a person of your word? Can people count on what you say? And will they stand there?
I was 29 years old when I got elected to the United States Senate. And I came from anot a poor background, but a modest background. My dad never had a chance to go to college. We lived in a three-bedroom home, a split-level home with awith four kids and a grandpop. Andbut wewe were fine. It was when we were developing suburban areas, and they're building 60 homes alike. That kind of thing.
And the interesting thing was thatwell, for my dad, it was always aboutat any rate, I ended up running for office against a man in 1972when I was 29 years oldwho was a decent man. Matter of fact, he endorsed me the second time I ran. He was athis ain't your father's Republican Party. This is when there were other Republicans. And he was very much involved in the environmental movement and a lot. Anyway, a good man.
And Nixon won my State by 65 percent of the vote. And I won by a whopping 3,100-vote majoritya plurality. And that's because I haveyou guys are only missing one thing. You got three brothers together like I did, but we had a sister who was smarter and better looking than all of us. And she managed[laughter]she managed all my campaigns.
And so, when I ran and I won, everybody would say: ""Well, you're 29 and you meet a guy who wasyou beat a guy who was very popular. What's your secret?"" Every time anyone was going to run for officeand I mean this is certainly; my word as a Bidenthey'd say: ""What'swhat's the secret? There must be something special. Because how the hell did you win?"" And I'd sayyou know, I'd just look at them.
And finally, I figured out whatand this is what I like about Scottisyou know, I said: ""The secret you have to communicate to people is, what is worthwhat are you worthwhat is worth to you to lose? What's worth losing over?"" Because if you don't know what you're willing to lose over, then you should be in another business. It doesn't mean you're bad or good. Just, you can make a lot more money doing other things. You can do a lot of things without a lot of grief. But what's worth losing over?
And, folks, there's anotherand that's what you are, pal.
Representative Scott H. Peters. Appreciate it.
The President. No, I reallyno, I really mean it. I really genuinely mean it.
And we have different politics these days, as you've all observed. You know, you may remember this. In theafter the 2020 election, which, finally, even Fox News is admitting I won. [Laughter]
But[laughter]you think I'm kidding. [Laughter]
But you know, it wasafter that election, I predicted we were going to do well in the off-year election. We were supposed to get clobbered. We were supposed to lose in 2022 overwhelmingly, and I was sure we weren't going to lose. Andbecause I think the American public has moved to a place where they're genuinely worried about our democracy. Not a joke. That's not hyperbole.
And I made a speech at Independence Hall saying, ""Democracy is at stake."" And I was very, very graphic about what was at stake. And we only lost by five votes, and we shouldn't have lost that. They were in New York State. And we actually picked up Governor seats.
My point is this: The American public, I think, knows what they want. Andbut we have allowed, because of the nature of howand I know the press is here, and there's good folks in the press. TheI think if you've gotpull them aside, like I get pulled aside and ask them honestly, you know, ""What's it like being in the press these days?"" Not a joke. ""What's it like being in the press these days?"" And it gets kind of hard. It gets kind of hard.
And soyou know, and people tune in to what they want to hear. Everybody, if you'reif you're a moderate to liberal, you want to look at MSNBC. That's the only thing you'll watch on cable. If you're conservative, you'll turn to Fox. And it's just getting too narrow what we're doing.
And I think the American public is a lot more united on critical things than we give them credit for, but it's awful hard these days to overcome, understandably, the cynicism and the like.
You know, I just think thatyou know, we've made some historic progress in the last 2 years. No matter whether I were President or not, it happened. We made historic progress. We've created 12 million new jobs, more than[applause]nothat's more jobs in 2 years than any President has created in 4 years. We've created 800,000 new manufacturing jobs. Eight hundred thousand.
Where is it written that we won't be the manufacturing capital of the world again? Where does it say that?
But we acted like that wasn't the case because we allowed certain things to happen. It was really easy in the past forand I hope I don't offend anybody, but I am going to just say what I believeit was really easy before, because what would happen is: Corporate America, beginningand I come from the corporate State of the world; more corporations in my State than every other State in the Union combined. Okay? And I won 36 years in a row. So I'm notI'm a capitalist; I'm not anticorporation.
But what happened aboutit started about 20 years ago. It started to findchase labor costs. And so a lot of corporations decided it was better to go find jobs overseas, which are cheaper laborand import the products.
Well, I decided we should change that dynamic. We should be importing thingswe should be importing jobs from overseas and sending product overseas. And that's begun to happen, because we're no longer looking for thethat formula.
When I announced for the Presidency of the United States in 2020, I said I was running for three reasons. One was to restore the soul of this country. And Ithat was not, againto use the word twicehyperbole. That wasthe dialogue had degraded so much, the way we talked to one another, the way wewe described one another in politics.
You know, I remember Imyafter my son had died, I decided I was never going to run for public office again. And so I got aI became a full professor at the University of Pennsylvania. And they set up the Biden Institute, and I could hire people that I brought from mythe former administration. And I was able to do that. And I enjoyed it.
But when I saw those folks coming out of the woods, literally, down in Charlottesville, Virginia, carrying torches, and singing the same anti-Semitic vile that was sung in the thirties in Germany, with swastikas, and accompanied by the White supremacistthe Ku Klux Klan, the leader. And a young woman was killed. I talked to her mom. A young woman was killed.
And the last guy who had this job, they asked, ""Well, can you describe what happened?"" He said, ""Well, there were two groups of very good people. There were two very good groups of people."" And that's when I decided that I had to do something.
And what happened wasthen I concluded that I just wasn't going to do it, because I knew how mean and ugly the race would be, because things have gotten meaner and uglier. And I haveI had two children left and four grandfive grandchildren. And what happened was that I decided I just couldn't do it.
We have a tradition in our family. Not a joke. Any child can ask for a family meeting. It only has occurred about 10 times from the time of my fathers, but I really mean it. If there was something serious on their mind, they're taken seriously.
So I got a phone call from my eldest granddaughter, named after my deceased daughter. And Naomi called. And she was, at that time, a senior at Columbia Law School. She said, ""We'd like to have a family meeting, Pop."" And then I had one who was a senior at the University of Pennsylvania, one who was a freshman at the University of Pennsylvania. And the one is with me tonight, who is mythe love of my life, Nataliemy deceased son's oldest. She's going to be a freshman at Penn next year. And my sonmy grandson, little Hunter Biden.
And so we had the meeting in the library with just Jill, me, and myat that timeI have six now, I had four grandchildrenor, excuse me, five grandchildrenthree granddaughters andfour granddaughters and a grandson. And they started to tell me why they thought I should run.
And my granddaughter said, ""Well, you know, Daddy would want you to run, Pop. Daddy would want you to run."" I said, ""It's going to be too mean, honey.""
And I ended upwithout taking you through it allmy youngestHunter, who is now justwas atjust last night his 18th birthday17th birthday. He took out his cell phone, and he said, ""Pop, we know it's going to be mean,"" and showed me a photograph on the cell phone of me walking out of the memorial mass for my son Beau where there are 2,000 people who showed upwith my hand on a straighthand on a flag-draped coffin. He won the Bronze Star, the Conspicuous Service Medal. He was a hell of a guy. And I had my arm around my sonthe way I put my armI had my arm around my grandson like this
[At this point, the President put his hand on the shoulder of an audience member.]
when we're walking. And my other hand was on the coffin. And the caption in theon theI got to know which unit it was onsaid, ""Biden molests another child."" He said, ""We know it's going to be ugly, Pop.""
And that's when I decided to go ahead and run. Because, look, folks, that's not who we are. That is not who we are as a people. I don't believe that for a second. It's a distinct minority and it's been given too much license, but that's not who we are. And so I decided to run.
And when I did, I decided the best thingthere are certain things that areyou know, as I said, back when I told you why ran in the first placethere are certain things worth losing over. There are certain things worth losing over. It's not worth the job if you have to support things you really don't think are correct.
If it's a toss-up, I go with what the public opinion is. But if it's anything else, I go with what I think.
And so what happened was, we were told we couldn't do anything in a bipartisan way. But guess what? We passed more major bipartisan legislation than anybody has in the recent past. We, first of all, passed the first piece ofmajor piece of legislation, which bailed out every State, county, and city in America; it was almost $2 trillion, without a single Republican vote. But it broughtit kept us from emptying our nurses and hospitals and making sure we had first responders andbecause the cities and counties didn't have the money from taxfrom tax revenue to pay to keep them onon the job.
And then, what we did was we sat down and, you know, made sure that we began to focus on the Inflation Reduction Act, which we put in, for example, a $369 billion investment in climate, because it is the existential threat to humanity.
Our grandchildren and great grandchildren are either going to live lives that are decent and honorable and good, or they're going to be in real trouble. If we let theif we go to about 1.5 centigrade abovedegrees above where we are now, we're done; there's no way to turn it around, according to the scientists that tell us.
And so we passed that. And then wewhat we did was we decided to focus on inflation because it was bad. And we brought down inflation 30 percent since the summer. Gas prices are down more than $1.50 from their peak.
And NATO united in Europe isunder Ukraineto do with Ukraine. Remember, when the war started, I was unfortunatelybecause I had access that I made sure that I was going to not reveal what the intelligence people call ""sources and methods""who said it or did it. But I gotI got clearance from the intelligence community. And remember, I said that those 158,000 people along the border, those Russians on the Ukrainian borderI said they're going to invade. Because I wanted everybody to know we knew what was happening. And they invaded. The largest invasion since World War II. Over 185,000 Russian troops invaded.
And so, because he counted on the fact that NATO was not going to hold, NATO would split, we wouldn't all agree. Well, I've spent literally over 1,800 hours dealing with all those NATO leadersas recently as today, by the way, with one of them, from Great Britainholding us together, not because of me, but just working it. Because I'm convinced that if we stay together, they cannot succeed.
And so the end result of all that is that Putin was of the of the mind that he was going to be able to break NATO and split the alliance and that's when everything would begin to fall apart.
Well, folks, you see what's happening to those Ukrainians. They're a brave people. God love them, as my mother would say. God love them. They're doing a remarkable job. And now you have 144 members of the United Statesofexcuse me, of the United Nationssaying that the Russians are dead wrong, they're engaged in serious genocide that's going on in that country. They don't say ""genocide""war crimes.
But the point I'm making is that there was a miscalculation. And so we've all stayed together. And the end result has been that NATO isthey're still hanging on. Who knows what exactly is going to happen from here on in. That's another issue.
But the point is that we held democracies thatwe held the democracies together, all of us.
And so, in addition, we passed the most significant bipartisan gun safety law in 30 yearsghost guns and other things. But you know, you may remember, I got in a lot of trouble because, 15 or 20 years earlier, I'm the guy that passed theI was the guy that wrote the assault weapons ban and limited the number of bullets that can be in a clip. Who in God's name needs a 100-bullet magazine on a gun for any reason other than to kill people?
And so it passed. And violent and mass murderers went down significantly in that 10 years, from the early nineties, when we passed it, until the first Republican administration came along, and they couldn't get the votes to keep it.
But the point is, we gotfor 30 years, we got nothing done on guns. Well, now we got the gun law passed, and it's helping. But I'm not going to rest until we pass the assault weapons ban and aand a limitation on the magazines that are existing.
And so, you know, it used to be that we were the ones who werewe spent 2 percent of our GDP on research and development as a nation. We used to be number one in the world. Now we're number nine in the world. China used to be number eight in the world. Now they're number one in the worldnumber two in the world.
We are the nation of innovation, research and development. But we stopped investing in both of those things, not onlyI'm going to get to it in a secondnot only in terms of medicine, but in terms of everything.
And so, when we passed that bill, we passedIwe wrote a bill that was called the CHIPS and Science Act. The CHIPS and Science Act has attracted a commitment of $300 billion in investment from around the world and here in the United States. The first major initiative to build these computer chips, which are the sizelittle size of the tip of your little finger and are extremelyneeded for everything, from automobiles to your new refrigerators and every major initiative we have going on.
Well, guess what? We weren't able to get them during the pandemic because we were importing them from Asia, South Asia; we were importing them from other places, and we couldn't get them.
And that's whyfor example, the reason why inflation spiked 2 years ago is, we couldn't buy any automobiles. The cost of automobiles went up so high because they didn't have the computer chips to make our automobiles. And so the end result was we got this passed.
Andfor example, the first major initiative is a $20 billion investment by Intel, just about 20 miles, not even that far, west of Cleveland, in a thousand acres of what I call the ""field of dreams."" They're going to build two ""fabs,"" they call them.
It's going to take a total of 12,000 workers to do it; 7,000 construction workers making a union wage. I make no apologies for that. And number two, 5,000 people are going to work in these fabs. You know what the average salary of these fabs are going to be? A hundred and thirty thousand dollars a year. And you don't need a college degree.
And that'snow, we have commitments for $300 billion for that investment. We just announced the same thing up in Syracuse, New York; Poughkeepsie, New York; out inand Arizona and New Mexico. It's going to be all over the country.
And we're going to put people to work, and we're going to be the beginning of the supply chain, not the end. And we're going to make it available everybody, to other countries as well. But you're just not going to be on the short end of that supply chain any longer. And it's beginning to have a real impact. It's going to create thousands of good-paying jobs.
In addition to that, what we did was, we passed the infrastructure law. You know, how can you beyou all know, if you ever get involvedand I can tell anybody who works at the State legislature or anywhere elseyou want to attract a business, what do you have to do? First question they ask you: ""How close is the nearest port? Where'swhat's the access to highway or rail? What's the""and it goes on. Because they want to make a product they can get to market as quick as possible.
How can you be the leading country in the world with a second-rate infrastructure? We used to rank number one. Now we ranked number 15 in the world. How did that happen? What do we do?
So guess what? We're creating thousands upon thousands of good-paying jobs. And we're investing in everythingnot just roads and ports and bridges, which we're doingbut also high- speed internet that's available and safe and cheap for everyone in America, making sure that you don't have toif you have toif you have another shutdown on the schools for whatever reason, you don't have to pull in front of the McDonald's parking lot to connect to the internet so your kid can do their homework. Not a joke.
A gentleman told me he is both a doc and a cattle rancher. Well, if you want to be able to know when to sell your cattle, man, you got to do ityou have to have internet to be able to beto know when the best time is. There's a whole range of things.
My generic point is simple: We have to have the best infrastructure in the world if we're going to have the best economy in the world. And, again, it creates thousands of new jobs, good jobs.
And by the way, we're investing oneand it's bipartisan$1 trillion 200 billion over 10 years. Remember last guy around, we talked about ""Infrastructure Week"" and it never occurred? We got ""Infrastructure Decade""Infrastructure Decade"" to modernize this country in a way that used to be back when we led the world.
And so the point I'm making is, there's so much within our power that we can do. And we're in a situation where, you know, theas II won't even get into the Inflation Reduction Act again, but there's so many things. And we're doing all thisat the same time in the last 2 years, I cut the debtwe cut the deficit by a larger number than any President has ever in history: $1.7 trillion. That year, we spent $1.7 trillion less than we spentI mean, and for all these programs.
And one of the ways we did it is, we started to ask people to pay their fair share, just their fair share. And, for example, there werein 2020, there were 5455 Fortune 500 companies. Good folks. I'm a capitalist, as I said. But you know, capitalism without competition is not capitalism. And just pay your fair share.
So there were 55 companies that made $40 billion and didn't pay a single penny in tax. And I did a horrible thing. I suggested they should have to pay a minimum of 15 percent. That's less than the people putting on this meal for you pay in taxes. And guess what? It paid for it all.
And so my point is this: My dad used to have an expression. He'd say that: ""Don't tell me what your value. Show me your budget, and I'll tell you what your value."" Don't tell me what you value. Show me your budget, and I will tell you what you value.
Well, I introduced my budget last week, and it reflects what I value. And ""everyone deserves a fair shot"" is my basic value.
And I said, you know, one ofthe second reason I ran was to rebuild the backbone of the country, the middle classbuild it from the middle class out, and the poor have a way up, and the wealthy still do very well. Still do very well.
And so, you know, our Tax Code should be fair. And we should build an economy, as I said, from the middle out and the bottom up, and that's what I would think would be fiscally responsible.
So we just have very different views this new MAGA Republican group. And I saidI used the phrase twiceit's not your father's Republican Party. This a different deal. I know Republican Senators who served here, and they'reand a they'rea lot of them are friends I've had now. Nine Republican Senators I used to serve with come in and say: ""I agree with you, Joe. But if I say anything, I'll lose in a primary. I'll lose my seat."" Not what you call a ""profile in courage,"" but at least in honesty.
And so what's happening? For example, the House Freedom Caucus in the House of Representatives, they just introducedtheir budget. It cuts veterans benefits. It won't cut subsidies for Big Pharma.
For example, when we passed the Inflation Reduction, we said for the first timeyou know, as you all know, because a lot of docs and people are concerned about cancer in hereone of the things that is at stake is, we pay the highest drug prices of any major nation in the world, the highest by a longshotby a longshot. And the only thing the law says that Medicare and the Government can't negotiate for prices for is in Medicare. The only one.
And so we finally said, ""No, no, no, you're going to be able to negotiate with Medicare."" Because like the Germans and otherother countries have, there's a limitation on how much you can spend.
And by the wayso, for example, I'll bet every one of you know someone who has stage 1 or stage 2 diabetes. Raise your hand if you know anybody who has that. You need insulin. It's been around for 100 years. It costs $10 to manufacture it. And it costs, if you package it and the whole deal, you can argue as much as $13. So guess what? We passed a law and set the price at $35 instead of $4- to $600 a month. It saves people's lives. It saves people's lives.
And every year for the next 5 years, we're going to be able to take 10 more drugs and put them on the market that, in fact, Medicare is going to say we're going to pay no more than a, b, c, or d.
Well, guess what? Eli Lilly decided they're going to only charge $35 now, and they're one of the largest producers of insulin. Well, the likelihood that anybody is going to be able to continue to charge four, five, six hundred bucks is not likely. And so we're beginning to make some progress.
But the point of it is that if in fact younow, you not only cut prices for the patient. Guess what? This year, you're going to saveMedicare, the government is going to reduce the deficit by $160 billion. Hear me? And not only is it the right thing to do for people, it cuts the deficit by $160 billion. $160 billion. Because Medicare doesn't have to pay out that $160 billion to pay for the higher prices.
Sobut, folks, there's athere's an awful lot. There's an awful lot thatthat we can do.
And here's the deal. You know, if you look at what the MAGA Republicans do, I also think it's long past time we should stop subsidizing Big Oil. We're not going towhy subsidize Big Oil?
And the second thing is that we also haveyou know, corporate America. You remember whenRonald Reagan, your former Governor here? Well, guess what? He wanted to reduce, and he did reduce, the tax rate from 36 percent for corporations to 28 percent. If we did even 21 percent, which is supposedly now, we'd raise billions and billions of dollars to pay for all the research I want to talk about.
But look, the new Republican budget in House includes zero deficit reduction. Matter of fact, it willwewhen folks talk about, we have no intention of letting the extremes of one partyand they are the extremes. They're not the majority, but they will be able toI think, in Housebe able to be successful in terms of what they're going to do.
But the point is that what we're going to do is make sure that they have to make their case. They say that we're the big spenders. Well, if we just implement what we already passed, wewe're going to winjust what we've passed, nothing else. If we didn't pass another thing. It continued to reduce the deficit and the impact on so many other things.
Look, the stakes are too high for our economy, for our democracy, for our standing in the world. And I intend to build on the progress and finish the job we set out to do.
And let me conclude by talking about something I care a lot about. When I was Vice President, the President allowed me to set up a Cancer Moonshot to begin to make real focus. Because, for example, certain childhood cancersthe major companies don't want to invest anything in it, because there's not that much to make. If you only have 200,000 people dying of that cancer, it's not goingthey're not going to put a lot of money into it, and so on.
A lot of you, I'vereferenced your concerns to me about cancer when you came in as I met you. Well, you know, the idea isthis Cancer Moonshot, I've revived asas your President. I brought it back.
And what we're doing here is, Iyou know, there's a thing called DARPA in the defense budget. It's the thing that gave us geopositioning. It's the thing that gave us all those things that we need that are the cutting-edge elements of the Defense Department. And I've been very involved in foreign policy and defense for a long time.
And I thought to myself, why don't we have an ARPAARPA-Hthe Department of Health and Human Services? Why don't we invest the same kind of money to deal with cancer?
So, so far, I committed we're going to spend $5 billion. We havewe've committed 250$2.5 billion so far, and another $2.5 billion next year. Well, that's a hell of a start.
And again, without being critical of any drug company, who's going to want to invest all the money they need to invest in if the return is not can be significantly higher than their investment? Can't blame them.
So I think we should be funding this ARPA-H, the Department ofat Health and Human Services. And I think we canwe've significantly reducedyoumany of you in this room have significantly reduced cancer deaths now. We're turning some cancers into chronic diseases and be able to be maintained. And there are a number of cures that are on theiron the edge.
Look at what happened with Jimmy Carter. Now, heIhe asked me to do his eulogy. I'mexcuse me, I shouldn't say that. I've spent time with Jimmy Carter. And it's finally caught up with him, but they found a way to keep him going for a lot longer than he was anticipated to go because they found a breakthrough. Immunotherapy is incredibly important. And you know, whether it's for brain cancer or anything else, I am aI've been the recipient of the good work of many of you here. I have two cranial aneurysms, one major embolism. Took the top of my head off the second time, Mom, because they said they couldn't find a brain the first time. [Laughter]
But all kidding aside, it's amazing what our neurosurgeons are able to do and neurologists are able to do. Amazing. And I believe we canmy goal is that we cut cancer by 50 percent in the next 25 years at the maximum. And I think we can do it, and we can turn a lot of cancers[applause].
But here's the deal, you know, and I'll end with this. I'm sorry to go on too long, but I'm fairly passionate about this issue.
You know, I just think we have to remember it's never been a good bet to bet against America. It's never been a good bet to bet against America. And I think it's time we finish the job. The stakes are too high for our economy, for our democracy, for our standing in the world. And I intend to build on the progress and finish the job we started.
I've long said that there's nothing beyond our capacity. I've never been more optimistic in my whole career, and I mean this sincerely. Everybody said, ""Why the hell would you be with the way things are?"" And I've never been so optimistic of what we can do. I mean it from the bottom of my heart.
We're at an inflection point in human history.
I had a professor who used to say: ""An inflection point is, you're going down the highway at 60 miles an hour, and you take a hard right 20 degrees. You can never get back on the course you're on."" That's where we are on climate, on health care, on international relations, on so many things.
We can determine where we go from here, but we've got to remember who the hell we are. We're the United States of America. There is nothingI mean nothingbeyond our capacity when we do it togetherwhen we do it together. And I'm determinedI'm determined to see that done no matter what happens.
And, folks, the fact is that I think if you take a look at the data. The vast majority of the American people agree. There's noneof the substance of things I've raised is there any opposition to. But the opposition is going to make my case a little easierI can say with the press here, before they leavebecause they're going to present an alternative. Their budget is going toand, so far, what they've introduced is going to increase the deficit by about $3.7 trillion. So you know, I mean, what are they going to cut?
Any of you watch the State of the Union? I wouldn't blame if you hadn't. Well, you were there.
Well, I'll conclude with this story. I was standing in the State of the Union and I must tell you, I've been ain the Congress for so long, I feel comfortable standing before, just like II made many speeches before the Congress.
And I was laying out what I was going todoing. I said, ""And there's a desire to cut Social Security and Medicare."" And the distinguished lady from[laughter]from Georgiathe mountains of Georgiastarted yelling, ""Liar! Liar! Liar!"" And that generatedby the way, the last time anybody did that, they got censured for doing it. Okay? And then five or six others started: ""Liar! Liar! Liar!""
And I said, ""You don't want to cut Social Security and Medicare?"" ""No, we don't."" I said, ""Everybody who doesn't""and I never thought I'd negotiate with the whole Congress. [Laughter] I said, ""Anybody in thisin the Congress here who doesn't want to cut Social Security and Medicare, stand up and holler."" And they all stood up hollering, ""We won't cut it."" And then I polled them. They were all on camera. [Laughter] So I hope they keep their commitment and not cut it.
But my generic point is, there is a lot we can do. There's a lot we can do. We can do it fairly without overtaxing people, without making itwith just being fair. Just giving people an even shot. That's all this is about. And I think the public is going to be there.
With your help, you're going to allow me to be in the game and the DNC to be in the game. So thank you, thank you, thank you.

2023-03-13 00:00:00,"Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia and an Exchange With Reporters at Naval Base Point Loma, California","
President Biden. Well, Mr. Prime Minister, welcome to San Diego.
And through both war and peace, we've been together in every endeavor we've hadjoint security efforts, and it's been across the board. And that's exactly what we're doing now. I think this is a really consequential agreement we just made, and I think it's going to make a big difference in terms of ourand represents our vision and our values of what needs to be done.
And I think that, you know, we're investing in the manufacturing base in both our countries as well, in addition to the impact on our military capacity. And I think that it's going to be a gamechanger, in my view.
And I think that that, coupled with the Quad, which we're both a part ofincluding Japan and Indiathat we have aan ability to expand the maritime domain of democracies and peace, stability, and some security. I think that's important.
And together, we're working on climate change and regional stability, including an economic coercion that's taking place in your part of the worldnot by you, but by others.
And we're going to step up tofor the people of Ukraine. We've stuck together on that. I just had a very good meeting with our colleague from Great Britain on that issue.
And today we're going to discuss the deepening U.S.-Australia commitment to one another. And I really do think we have an opportunity toI don't view what we're doing as a challenge to anybody. I view it as a means by which we're bringing stability into the South China Sea, the Indian Ocean. And I think it's going to be greetedwhen they realize our purposeby everyone as maintaining stability and security. And we can continue the basic rules of the road.
Thank you. And I look forward toremember, you invited me down to Australia. I'm coming.
Prime Minister Albanese. Any day.
President Biden. I'm coming. No way out for you.
But thank you.
Prime Minister Albanese. Well, thank you very much, Mr. President. We look forward to welcoming you down in Australia for the Quad meeting in May. I'm sure it will be a very successful visit. And this is our fourth meeting inI haven't yet been Prime Minister for a year, so we've been in very regular contact and developed a personal friendship and relationship of trust as well, which is something that should be there between our two great nations.
And today what we've really done is just to demonstrate a next chapter in our history together. WeJohn Curtin, one of my great Labor Prime Minister predecessors, during World War II, said famously: ""We turn to America. We look to America in our time of need."" And ever since then, we have stood side by side.
And today I think it is very important, very significant that you have agreed for just the second time in history to share this technology. And I think it will make a difference in advancing security and stability in the region.
But also, we, of course, share a common interest in rebuilding manufacturing in our respective countries. And we see this as very much an economic plan, not just a defense and security plan. This high-tech manufacturing capacity that we're building will be really important going forward.
And when we talk about national security, we have shared your language about climate change being a national security issue as well, which is, of course, the entry ticket into credibility in the Pacific, in particular. And we have spent our first year in office really rebuilding relationships in the region based upon our action on climate change.
Your Inflation Reduction Act is the most significant piece of legislation ever on climate, and we are trying to also deal with the challenge which is there.
We so much look forward to welcoming you and Prime Minister Modi and Prime Minister Kishida down to Australia in just a couple of months now. And then, I'll look forward to being at APEC as well when you're hosting that later this year. So, we're going to have to see a lot of each other on an ongoing basis. But that's
President Biden. As far as I'm concerned, that's good.
Prime Minister Albanese. That is a very good thing.
And in Australia, I have no doubt that this agreement will be very welcomed in Australia. And it's a long-term plan, but it's been a lot of work to get it right. So thank you to your administration for the leadership which you've shown.
President Biden. Well, I think everything you said about it is accurate.
I'd like to point out one other thing. I want the world to understandwhich youyou and I fully understand, as does the Prime Minister of Great Britainthat we're talking about nuclear power, not nuclear weapons. It is critical that the world understand that and that we've worked with the IAEA.
Prime Minister Albanese. Yes.
President Biden. They sign off on what we're doing. And I think it's really very, very important that they will continue to deal with nonproliferation states law.
So I look forward to coming down. So thank you.
Prime Minister Albanese. It's going to be fun, too.

Q. [Inaudible]at all, Mr. President?
President Biden. I've got a brief statement to talk about my friend here for a second. First of all, I want to welcome him back to California. He's a Stanford man, and he still has a home here in California. That's why I'm being very nice to him; maybe he'll invite me to his home here in California.
But all kidding aside, I think it's a historic day for our country. And I think this is going to be aI think it's not us, but I think the circumstances is going to go down in history as one of those moments that we put together an organization of three nations that is going to help sustain the peace and security in the Indo-Pacific. And I really believe that. And you know, there's no issue of global consequence where the United States and Great Britain aren't in concert.
We're going to talk about a lot of things today, including our joint commitment to dealing with the situation inRussia's brutal invasion of Ukraine. And so we talked about our common vision and values, and try to figure out where we can cooperate even more together.
And so I yield to you, Mr. Prime Minister.
Prime Minister Sunak. Well, thanks, Mr. President. It's great to be back in California, so thank you for having me. But particularly, to announce, as you described rightly, probably the most consequential multilateral defense partnership since the one that our two countries did some generations ago.
And, as we both talked about earlier, never has beenthere been a more important time for allies like ours to come together. You know, we share the same values. It's right that we work together, given the security picture around the world. And that's what we've always done.
We sit next to each other on the Security Council. We're two of the biggest spenders in NATO. And there's no problem that the world has seen that isn't one that the two of us, working together, have not been able to try and address.
So it's a great pleasure to be here. And I look forward to our conversations and also, importantly, to invite you to Northern Ireland, which Ihopefully, you will be able to do andso we can commemorate the anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement. I know it's something that's very special and personal to you. We'd love to have you over.
President Biden. It is, but it's worrisome25 years. It seems like yesterday. Seems like yesterday.
But anyway, thank you.

President Biden. Well, pleaseif you have a seat, please take it.
It's an honor to be here to welcome Prime Minister Albanese and Prime Minister Sunak. And it's my honor to welcome you both to the United States as we take the next critical step in advancing the Australia, U.S., U.K. partnershipAUKUS. [Laughter] It's an unusual name, ""AUKUS,"" but it's a powerful entity.
You know, when our countries first announced AUKUS 18 months ago, I'm not at all sure that anyone would have believed thathow much progress we'd be able to make together and how quickly we'd accomplish it.
And I want to thank the members of all our teams who helped bring us to this pivotal moment sitting here in front of us. Thank you all very much.
Secretary Austin; Secretary of the Navy Del Toro, thanks for letting us come to your house; Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Gildaywhere are you, Admiral? There you are. And thank you for hosting us at Naval Base at Point Loma.
And I also want to thank Representative Joe Courtney, founder of the bipartisan AUKUS working group, and all the Members of the Congress who are here today. Thank you for being here. You are a testament to the strong and deep support for this partnership across the United States.
Australia and the United Kingdom are two of America's most stalwart and capable allies. Our common values and our shared vision for a more peaceful and prosperous future unite us all across the Atlantic and Pacific. For more than a century, we've stood together to defend freedom and strengthen democracy and to yourand to spur greater opportunity in all our countries.
I've always said, when asked, the United States is a Pacific power, because we're on the Pacific Ocean. We are a Pacific power. The United States has safeguarded stability in the Indo-Pacific for decades to the enormous benefits of nations throughout the region, from ASEAN to Pacific Islanders to the People's Republic of China.
In fact, our leadership in the Pacific has been a benefit to the entire world. We've kept the sea lanes and skies open and navigable for all. We've upheld basic rules of the road that fueled international commerce. And our partnerships have helped underwrite incredible growth and innovation.
So, today, as we stand at the inflection point in history where the hard work of enhancing deterrence and promoting stability is going to affect the prospect of peace for decades to come, the United States can ask for no better partners in the Indo-Pacific, where so much of our shared future will be written.
In forging this new partnership, we're showing again how democracies can deliver our own security and prosperity, and not just for us, but for the entire world. Today we're announcing the steps to carry out our first project under AUKUS: developing Australia's conventionally armed nuclear-powered submarine capacity.
And I want to be clearI want to be clearto everyone from the outset, right off the bat, so there's no confusion or misunderstanding on this critical point: These subs are powerednot nuclear-armed subs. They're nuclear powered, not nuclear armed. Australia is a proud non-nuclear weapons state and has committed to stay that way. These boats will not have any nuclear weapons of any kind on them. Each of us standing here today representing the United States, Australia, and Great Britain is deeply committed to strengthening the nuclear nonproliferation regime.
We've undertaken this project working hand in glove with the International Atomic Energy Agency and with Director General Grossi. Australia will not produce the nuclear fuel needed for these submarines. We have set the highest standards with the IAEA for verification and transparency, and we will honor each of our countries' international obligations.
Working together these past 18 months, we've developed a phased approach that's going to make sure Australian sailors are fully trained and prepared to safely operate this fleet so they can deliver this critical new capacity on the fastestfastestpossible timetable.
Each of our nations is making concrete commitments to one another. We're backing it up with significant investments to strengthen the industrial bases in each of our countries in order to build and support these boats.
By the way, this partnership is going to mean an awful lot for good-paying jobs for all workers in our countries, including a lot of union jobs.
There's a reason why not everyone has nuclear-powered submarines: Nuclear propulsion is a highly complicated technology that requires years of training to master. So we're starting right away. Beginning this year, Australian personnel will embed with U.S. and U.K. crews on boats and at bases in our schools and our shipyards.
We'll also begin to increase our port visits to Australia. In fact, as we speak, the nuclear-powered sub the USS Asheville is making a port call in Perth as we speak. And later this decade, we will also be establishing a rotational presence of U.S. and U.K. nuclear-powered subs in Australia to help develop the work force Australia is going to need to build and maintain its fleet.
One of the vessels you see behind me is a Virginia-class nuclear-powered submarine, the USS Missouri. Top-of-the-line submarines are the vanguard of U.S. naval power.
And excuse me for a point of personal privilegeas they say in the United States Senate, where I've spent a lot of timethese submarines hold a special place for the Bidens. My wife, Dr. Jill Biden, is the sponsor of the USS Delaware, a Virginia-class submarine, and she never lets me forget it. [Laughter]
They feature cutting-edge propulsion technology, provide unmatched stealth and maneuverability. And with the support and approval of Congress, beginning in the early 2030s, the United States will sell three Virginia-class submarines to Australia with the potential to sell up to two more if needed, jumpstarting their undersea capability a decade earlier than many predicted.
But the ultimate goal isn't just selling subs to Australia, it's developing something new together. We're calling it the SSN-AUKUS. This new state-of-the-art conventionally armed nuclear-powered submarine that will workthat will combine U.S. submarineU.K. submarine technology and design with American technology.
And I want to reiterate again: The SSN-AUKUS will not have nuclear weapons.
It will become a future standard for both the U.K. Royal Navy and the Royal Australian Navy. It will meet Australia's defense needs while bringing our militaries, our scientists, our engineers, our shipbuilders, our industrial workforce, our countries closer togethercloser than ever.
Let me emphasize again: Nuclear propulsion is tested and safe. The United States and the U.K. have used it for nearly 70 years fromwith a spotless recorda spotless record. Combined between the U.S. and U.K., all of our nuclear-powered ships have traveled the entire globearound the entire globe, more than 150 million miles. That's going to the Moon 300 times.
Now, we can't figure out how to get this sub to the Moon, but we're working on it. [Laughter] And I've got to admit, our stewardship of naval nuclear propulsion technology is a point of honor, pride, and deep tradition currently helmed by Admiral Frank Caldwell, who is here today. Where are you, Admiral? Thank you.
And the years of training we're undertaking, starting now, will ensure that Australia is fully prepared to carry on this tradition and meet the highest possible standards of safety throughout the life of these boats.
Our unprecedented trilateral cooperation, I believe, is testament to the strength of the longstanding ties that unite us and to our shared commitment of ensuring the Indo-Pacific remains free and open, prosperous and secure, defined by opportunity for all, a shared commitment to create a future rooted in our common values.
That's the objective the United States shares not only with the U.K. and Australia. It's shared by our friends in the region; by our friends in ASEAN, the Pacific Islands Forum, and the Quad; and our other treaty and close partners in the Indo-Pacific and Europe.
AUKUS has one overriding objective: to enhance stability in the Indo-Pacific amid rapidly shifting global dynamics. And this first projectthis first projectis only the beginning. More partnerships and more potential, more peace and security in the region lies ahead. Simply stated, we're putting ourselves in the strongest possible position to navigate the challenges of today and tomorrow together. Together.
So I thank you again, Prime Minister Albanese, Mr.Prime Minister Sunak. And the United States could not ask for two better friends or partners to stand with as we work to create a safer, more peaceful future for the people everywhere.
I'm proud to be your shipmates. Thank you.
Prime Minister Albanese. Well, President Biden, Prime Minister Sunak, I am so honored to stand alongside you both here overlooking the Pacific Ocean as leaders of true and trusted friends of my country of Australia.
Today a new chapter in the relationship between our nation, the United States, and the United Kingdom begins, a friendship built on our shared values, our commitment to democracy, and our common vision for a peaceful and a prosperous future.
The AUKUS agreement we confirm here in San Diego represents the biggest single investment in Australia's defense capability in all of our history, strengthening Australia's national security and stability in our region; building a future made in Australia with record investments in skills, jobs, and infrastructure; and delivering a superior defense capability into the future.
My government is determined to invest in our defense capability. But we're also determined to promote security by investing in our relationships across our region.
From early in the next decade, Australia will take delivery of three U.S. Virginia-class nuclear-powered submarines. This is the first time in 65 years and only the second time in history that the United States has shared its nuclear propulsion technology. And we thank you for it.
We are also proud to partner with the United Kingdom to construct the next generation submarine to be called SSN-AUKUS, a new conventionally armed nuclear-powered submarine, based on a British design and incorporating cutting-edge Australian, U.K., and U.S. technologies. This will be an Australian sovereign capability, built by Australians, commanded by the Royal Australian Navy, and sustained by Australian workers in Australian shipyards with construction to begin this decade.
Australia's proud record of leadership in the international nuclear nonproliferation regime will of course continue. We will continue to adhere to all of our obligations under the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Treaty of Rarotonga.
Our agreement unlocks a set of transformative opportunities for jobs and skills and research and innovation in Adelaide and in Barrow-in-Furness, in Western Australia, and here in the United States.
Opportunities that will shape and strengthen and grow Australia's economy for decades and create around 20,000 direct jobs for Australians from many trades and specializations: engineers, scientists, technicians, submariners, administrators, and tradespeople. Good jobs with good wages, working to ensure the stability and prosperity of our nations, our region, and, indeed, our world.
Our future security will be built and maintained not just by the courage and professionalism of our defense forces, but by the hard work and know-how of our scientists and engineers, our technicians and programmers, our electricians and welders.
For Australia, this whole-of-nation effort also presents a whole-of-nation opportunity. We will work with the State governments of South Australia and Western Australia to develop training programs that equip Australians with the skills they need to fill these jobs.
Working together, our universities and research institutes will collaborate to train more Australians in nuclear engineering. We're already sharing skills and knowledge and expertise across our borders, lifting the capability and capacity of all three countries.
Already, today, Australians are upskilling on nuclear technology and stewardship alongside their British and American counterparts. Already, today, there are Australian submariners undergoing nuclear power training in the United States. And I'm proud to confirm, Mr. President, that they are all in the top 30 percent of their class. [Laughter]
Built by innovation and extraordinary and emerging technologies, these boats will present a unique opportunity for Australian companies to contribute not only to the construction and sustainment of Australia's new submarines, but to supply chains in America and in Britain.
The scale, complexity, and economic significance of this investment is akin to the creation of the Australian automotive industry in the post-World War II period.
And just as a vision of my predecessors, Curtin and Chifley, in creating our automotive industry lifted up our entire manufacturing sector, this investment will be a catalyst for innovation and research breakthroughs that will reverberate right throughout the Australian economy and across every State and Territory, not just in one design element, not just in one field, but right across our advanced manufacturing and technology sectors, creating jobs and growing businesses right around Australia, inspiring and rewarding innovation, and educating young Australians today for the opportunities of tomorrow.
Our AUKUS partnership is not just about the U.S. and U.K. sharing their most advanced submarine capability with Australia, although we do appreciate that. It's also about building on the expertise within our three nations so that we can achieve things greater than the sum of our parts.
This is a genuine trilateral undertaking. All three nations stand ready to contribute, and all three nations stand ready to benefit. I look out from here today, and I see new frontiers in innovation to cross, new breakthroughs in technology to achieve, a new course for us to chart together.
Mr. President, Prime Minister, for more than a century, our brave citizens from our three countries have been part of a shared tradition of service in the cause of peace and sacrifice in the name of freedom. We honor their memory today. We always will.
While we respect and honor the past, through AUKUS, we turn ourselves to face the future. Because what the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia hold in common is more fundamental and more universal than our shared histories. We are bound, above all, by our belief in a world where the sovereignty of every nation is respected and the inherent dignity of every individual is upheld; where peace, stability, and security ensure greater prosperity and a greater measure of fairness for all; and where all countries are able to act in their sovereign interests, free from coercion.
Our historic AUKUS partnership speaks to our collective and ongoing determination to defend those values and secure that future today, in the years ahead, and for generations to come, a journey that will strengthen the bonds between our nations as friends, as peers, as leaders.
We embark with great confidence in the capacity and creativity of our people, with optimism in the power of what our partnership can achieve, and with an unwavering conviction that whatever the challenges ahead, the cause of peace and freedom that we share will prevail.
Thank you very much.
Prime Minister Sunak. Sixty years ago, here in San Diego, President Kennedy spoke of a higher purpose: the maintenance of freedom, peace, and security. Today we stand together united by that same purpose. And recognizing that to fulfill it, we must forge new kinds of relationships to meet new kinds of challenge, just as we have always done.
In the last 18 months, the challenges we face have only grown. Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine, China's growing assertiveness, the destabilizing behavior of Iran and North Korea all threaten to create a world defined by danger, disorder, and division.
Faced with this new reality, it is more important than ever that we strengthen the resilience of our own countries. That's why the U.K. is today announcing a significant uplift in our defense budget. We're providing an extra 5 billion over the next 2 years, immediately increasing our defense budget to around 2.25 percent of GDP. This will allow us to replenish our war stocks and modernize our nuclear enterprise, delivering AUKUS and strengthening our deterrent. And our highest priority is to continue providing military aid to Ukraine, because their security is our security.
And we will go further to strengthen our resilience. For the first time, the United Kingdom will move away from our baseline commitment to spend 2 percent of GDP on defense to a new ambition of 2.5 percent, putting beyond doubt that the United Kingdom is and will remain one of the world's leading defense powers.
But ultimately, the defense of our values depends, as it always has, on the quality of our relationships with others. And those alliances will be strengthened through AUKUS, the most significant multilateral defense partnership in generations.
AUKUS matches our enduring commitment to freedom and democracy with the most advanced military, scientific, and technological capability. Nowhere is that clearer than in the plans we're unveiling today for the new AUKUS submarine, one of the most advanced nuclear-powered subs the world has ever known.
And those plans could not happen without cutting-edge American technology and expertise. So I pay tribute to you, Mr. President, for your leadership, and to you, Prime Minister, for your vision of what AUKUS can achieve.
And for our part, the U.K. comes to this with over 60 years' experience of running our own fleet. We'll provide the world-leading design and build the first of these new boats, creating thousands of good, well-paid jobs in places like Barrow and Derby. And we will share our knowledge and experience with Australian engineers so that they can build their own fleet.
Now, our partnership is significant because not just are we building the submarines together, they will also be truly interoperable. The Royal Navy will operate the same submarines as the Australian Navy, and we will both share components and parts with the U.S. Navy. Our submarine crews will train together, patrol together, and maintain their boats together. They will communicate using the same terminology and the same equipment.
And through AUKUS, we will raise our standards of nuclear nonproliferation. This is a powerful partnership. For the first time ever, it will mean three fleets of submarines working together across both the Atlantic and Pacific, keeping our oceans free, open, and prosperous for decades to come.
Joe, Anthony, we represent three allies who have stood shoulder to shoulder together for more than a century, three peoples who have shed blood together in defense of our shared values, and three democracies that are coming together again to fulfill that higher purpose of maintaining freedom, peace, and security now and for generations to come.
Thank you.
President Biden. With the permission of my colleaguesI don't know that our friends can hearbut, the USS Missouri, can you hear us?
Audience members. Hooyah, Mighty Mo'!
President Biden. I see them all over there. [Laughter] They're standing at attention. Can I tell them ""At ease""? I'm their Commander in Chief, right? I mean, they're[laughter].
Anyway, thank you, thank you, thank you. You all are the best. You're the best. And we're going to be the best in the world, the three of us.
Thank you all very, very much.

NOTE: The President spoke at 1:44 p.m. In his remarks, he referred to Deputy Administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration for the Office of Naval Reactors Adm. James F. Caldwell, Jr., USN.
"
2023-03-13 00:00:00,Remarks on the United States Banking System and the National Economy,"
The President. Good morning, everyone.
Before I leave for California, I want to briefly speak about what's happening to Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.
Today, thanks to the quick action of my administration over the past few days, Americans can have confidence that the banking system is safe. Your deposits will be there when you need them.
Small businesses across the country that had deposit accounts at these banks can breathe easier knowing they'll be able to pay their workers and pay their bills. And their hard-working employees can breathe easier as well.
Last week, when we learned of the problems of the banks and the impact they could have on jobs, some small businesses, and the banking system overall, I instructed my team to act quickly to protect these interests. They have done that. They have done that.
On Friday, the Government regulator in charge, the FDIC, took control of Silicon Valley Bank's assets. And over the weekend, it took control of Signature Bank's assets.
Treasury Secretary Yellen and a team of banking regulators have taken action, immediate action. And here are the highlights. First, all customers who had deposits in these banks can rest assuredI want torest assured they'll be protected and they'll have access to their money as of today. That includes small businesses across the country that banked there and need to make payroll, pay their bills, and stay open for business.
No losses will beand I wantthis is an important pointno losses will be borne by the taxpayers. Let me repeat that: No losses will be borne by the taxpayers. Instead, the money will come from the fees that banks pay into the Deposit Insurance Fund.
Because of the actions of thatbecause of the actions that our regulators have already taken, every American should feel confident that their deposits will be there if and when they need them.
Second, the management of these banks will be fired. If the bank is taken over by FDIC, the people running the bank should not work there anymore.
Third, investors in the banks will not be protected. They knowingly took a risk and when the risk didn't pay off, investors lose their money. That's how capitalism works.
And fourth, there are important questions of how these banks got into the circumstance in the first place. We must get the full accounting of what happened and why those responsible can be held accountable. In my administration, no one, in my viewno one is above the law.
And finally, we must reduce the risks of this happening again. During the Obama-Biden administration, we put in place tough requirements on banks like Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, including the Dodd-Frank Law, to make sure the crisis we saw in 2008 would not happen again.
Unfortunately, the last administration rolled back some of these requirements. I'm going to ask Congress and the banking regulators to strengthen the rules for banks to make it less likely that this kind of bank failure will happen again and to protect American jobs and small businesses.
Look, the bottom line is this: Americans can rest assured that our banking system is safe. Your deposits are safe. Let me also assure you: We will not stop at this. We'll do whatever is needed on top of all this.
Let's also take a looka moment to put the situation in a broader context. We've made strong economic progress in the past 2 years. We have created more than 12 million new jobs, more jobs in 2 years than any President has ever created in a single 4-year term. Unemployment is below 4 percent for 14 straight months. Take-home pay for workers is going up, especially for lower- and middle-income workers. And we've seen record numbers of people apply to start new businessesmore than 10 million of themmore than 10 million applications over the last 2 years starting businesses.
Now we need to keep the programthis progress going. That's what swift action that my administration, over the past few years, is all about: protecting depositors, protecting the banking system, protecting the economic gains we've made together for the American people.
Thank you. God bless you, and may God protect our troops. See you in California.
Q. Mr. President, what do you know right now about why this happened, and can you assure Americans that there won't be a ripple effect?
Q. Do you expect other banks to fail Mr. President?
Q. Should all depositors be protected at all banks?

NOTE: The President spoke at 9 a.m. in the Roosevelt Room at the White House.
"
2023-03-10 00:00:00,Remarks Prior to a Meeting With President Ursula von der Leyen of the European Commission,"
President Biden. Okay. Well, Madam President, welcome back to the White House. Welcome back to the Oval Office. And it's always good to see you. You've been doing an incredible job.
Two years ago, we committed to a new era of understanding between the EU and the U.S. I told you then that times have changed from the previous administration and that we view the EU as a great addition to security and economic security. And I thought we could benefit all our peoples. I think we have. I think we have.
And we stood with the brave people of Ukraine, providing security assistance and implementing historic sanctions that cut off Putin's ability to fund and to fight his war in Ukraine and to make it harder for him.
We supported Europe's energy security. I remember you and I talking about launching the joint task force and whether or not we'd be able to provide enough liquefied natural gas. We supplied twice as much as we thought
President von der Leyen. Indeed.
President Biden. we could. It worked. It's working.
President von der Leyen. This is really good.
President Biden. And it worked.
And, at the same time, we're driving new investments to create clean energy industries and jobs and make sure we have supply chains available to both our countriesour continents. And the ideaunder that idea is, it underpins our Inflation Reduction Act, and it lies at the heart of theyour Green Deal Industrial Plan in the EU. So, hopefully, we can talk a little bit about that today.
And finally, I want to thank you for your leadership on the ""Windsor Framework,"" which has protected the hard-earned peace that existed on the Good Fridayproceeds from the Good Friday Agreement, which I think has probably surprised a lot of Europeans how strongly so many Americans feel about that negotiated agreement.
And, Madam President, the steps the U.S. and the EU are taking over the last few years has increased energy security, it'sour economic security, and, I would argue, our national security.
So today I look forward to talking about all that with you and anything you'd like to talk about.
President von der Leyen. Thank you very much, Mr. President. It's a pleasure to be here; it's an honor to be back again. And it's good to come back here because we are not only partners, the European Union and the United States are good friends. And this could be felt throughout the whole work that we're doing together.
Indeed, you helped us enormously when we wanted to get rid of the Russian fossil fuel dependency byyou helped us enormously by delivering more LNG, helped us through the energy crisis.
We are, as partners, strongly supporting together Ukraine, that fights for freedom and independence. We're making Russia pay for its atrocious war. We're strongly aligned, defending our values.
And indeed, today, I think we will also discuss the Inflation Reduction Act, and I think it's great that there is such a massive investment in wind and clean technologies now. Indeed, we want to match it with the Green Deal Industrial Plan.
So, plenty of topicstopics to discuss together. Thank you very much, again.
President Biden. I look forward to doing that.
President von der Leyen. Thank you.
President Biden. Thank you. Thank you.

2023-03-10 00:00:00,Remarks on the Bureau of Labor Statistics Report on the Employment Situation in February and an Exchange With Reporters,"
The President. Hey, folks.
Q. Good morning, sir.
Q. Good morning, sir.
Q. Good morning.
The President. Good morning. Sorry we're latea little late. It's all my fault. [Laughter]
Well, look, I think we've got a good jobs report. I'm happy to report that our economy has created over 300,000 new jobs last month, and that's on top of a half a million jobs we added the month before.
All told, we've created more than 12,000 [12 million; White House correction]12,000 [12 million; White House correction] jobs since I took office, nearly 8,000 [800,000; White House correction] of them manufacturing jobs. That means, overall, we've created more jobs in 2 years than any administration has created in the first 4 years.
And I think all this matters. It's no accident. It means our economic plan is working.
And when I took office, the recoverythe economy wasthere was no recovery, and the economy was reeling. And the18 million people were unemployed, on unemployment insurance, compared to less than 2 million today. Unemployment was 6.3 percent, and the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office predicted it wouldn't get below 4 percent until 2026.
Because of our economic plan, unemployment has been below 4 percent for 14 straight months since January 2022. Last month, the unemployment rate remained near the lowest level in 50 years50 years.
And that's really good news. People who were staying out of the job marketthis is particularly good newsare now getting back into the job market. They're coming off the sidelines. They're getting back into the job market.
The share of working-age folks who are in the labor force is higher than it's been any time since 2008. That was one of the big predictors everybody was looking at.
Tomorrow it will be 2 years since I signed the American Rescue Plan into law. It led to the fastest recovery of everyany major economy in the world. It laid the foundation for the progress we've been seeing and we see today:
Record new business applications. More Americans with health care coverage than ever, including more than 14 million Americans saving $800 a year on their health insurance. Unprecedented tax relief for nearly 40 million families with 65 million children thanks to the child tax credit, which the childcut child poverty in half.
And since we passed the CHIPS and Science Act and the bipartisan infrastructure law and the Inflation Reduction Act, we've seen companies commit more than $300 billioncompanies from around the world commit more than $300 billionto invest in future manufacturing and innovation here in America, creating jobs.
We're going to invest in America again, we're going to make it in America again, and the Federal Government is going to buy American. That's been my economic vision.
But what does this progress really mean for families trying to get by? Well, I'll tell you. It means more people with good jobs and the dignity and security that comes with a paycheck.
And while we still have more to do and there may be setbacks along the way, inflation is now down 30 percent from what it was this summer. Gas prices are down more than $1.50 since their peak.
At the same time, take-home pay for workers has gone up, especially for lowerand this is important in my viewespecially for lower- and middle-income workers.
This all adds up to just a little bitI know you're tired of hearing me say itbreathing room. But I think it'sthat's just how people think about it: a little more breathing room for working families.
And today's job numbers is clear: Our economy is moving in the right direction.
Yesterday I went down to a hall in Philadelphia to lay out my budget and the outlines of my budget, which builds on the progress we've made growing an economy from the middle out and bottom up and thenot the top down.
It's a plan that keeps investing in American manufacturing and innovation and creates more good-paying jobs that don't require a college degree. It protects, strengthensand strengthens Medicare and Social Security, two bedrock programs Americans have been paying into with every paycheck they've ever earned since they've been a kid.
And we're paying for these investments. We're paying for it all. My plan, after it's all said and done, is going to cut the deficit nearly $3 trillion over the next 10 yearsthe plan I've submittedand by making the wealthy and corporations just begin
[At this point, the President coughed.]
just beginexcuse meto begin to pay their fair share.
You know, when we talk about 28-percent tax rate, Ronald Reagan was 28-percent tax rate. You know, that wacko liberal guy. You know? The idea that that's an unreasonable amount. But I'll get into that later.
Any rate, it continues to lower costs for families, building on the work we've already done to lower the cost of insulin and other prescription drugs to make health insurance more affordable. It brings down home energy costsbills for home energy costs.
And our plan is in stark contrast to the MAGA Republican plan in Congress where they're doubling down on the same failed policies of the past that would give special tax breaks to the wealthy, keep the tax breaks that were put in place by the last President, the wealthy taxbreaks for Big Oil, tax breaks for Pharmaat the expense of seniors and families.
You know, it's the kind of a top-down, trickle-down economics that never, ever worked. I know when I grew up, as you've heard me say before, not much trickled down on my dad's kitchen table.
So, you know, my dad used to have an expression. He'd say, ""Don'tI don't expect the Government to solve my problems, but I do expect the Government to understand my problems."" Not solve them, understand them.
Building a budget requires some really hard decisions. But all over America, families are sitting around their kitchen tables making decisions that are equally consequential. That's who my budget is for. It's about a value set, I said yesterday. Working people, middle classthe backbone of this countrysmall businesses, who are responsible for around half of all the jobs in the economy.
You know, the big corporationsthe Fortune 500they're big. But small businesses account for half the people employed in the economy. My budget reflects what we can do to lift the burden on hard-working Americans.
Today's news tells us that thanks to our efforts, there's 12 million more Americans that have jobs. The job is about a lot more than a paycheck, as I said. It's about dignity. It's about your family's dignity. And 12 million more Americans can look their kids in the eye and say, ""Honey, it's going to be okay,"" and mean it. You know, there's thethat's a little more dignity for 12 million Americans.
And it's not just good numbers. People can feel it. People are moving back into the work. But this may be the part that pleases me the most about the reportthe jobs report is, people who've been staying out of the job market are moving back inbeginning to move back in.
Jobs are available. People are working again. They're becoming more optimistic about their future.
And now, the biggest threat to our recovery is the reckless talkreckless talkmy MAGA friendsthis is not youras you've heard me say, it's not your father's Republican Party.
But the Republicans in the United States Congress, theywell, what they want to do with regard to the debt limit. You know, they're threatening to default on our national debt. In fact, planning to default, as some Republicans seem to be doing, puts us really much at risk.
I believe we should be building on our progress, not go backwards. So I urge our extreme MAGA Republican friends in the Congress to put their threats aside. Join me in continuing the progress we've built. We've got a lot more to do, so let's finish the job.
And by the way, you know, when we talk about what'swhat theirI just sawmy staff handed me as I was coming inthe House Freedom Caucus. There's members of the House Caucus who will consider voting to raise the debt ceiling contingent upon the enactment of legislation.
You know what the essence of the enacting legislation is? Cut all spending other than defense by 25 percent. Twenty-five percent across the board. Now, that means cops, firefighters. It means health care. It meansthat's justwhat they call ""discretionary spending,"" as you all know.
And, on top of that, thewhat they're really focused onI saw herewe'll getI shouldn't get into all this now, butisbut it'skind of surprised me. They want to make sure we don't have enough IRS agents.
You know those IRS agents we had? They're going to check on the accounts offor the superwealthy, which would require a lot of accounting, a lot of agents to look at it. [Laughter] They want to get rid of them.
I don't know. We just have a very different value set.
Anyway, I'm optimistic we're going to get the CPI next week. Hopefully, we'll be in some solid shape. But anyway.
Yes.
Inflation/National Economy/Federal Budget 
Q. Mr. President, are you concerned that rising interest rates will put a damper on this job growth and impact the economy?
And you mentioned the Freedom Caucus. Do you have any openness to negotiating on any of the issues that they mentioned?
The President. [Laughter] Well, first of all, we don't know what the CPI is going to be this week. It'sbut it's been downinterest rates have been downthe inflation has been down for many weeks in a row now.
And I said, we're going to see blips going up. I'mbutI feel confident that we're headed in the right direction. And there's a lot of talk about what the Fed will do and not do. We'll see. We'll see what the Fed will do.
But we'll see what thiswhat the CPI is. I guess it's Tuesday orMonday, Tuesday, Wednesdaynext week, it's coming out.
The idea that I'm going to agree that we start to figure out where we cut 25 percent across the boardand by the way, their entire program does not lower the deficit one single penny. They're keepingif theyif what they say they mean, they're going to keep the tax cuts of the last President, number onealmost $2 trillion.
If they're going toin fact, no additional taxes on thewealthymatter of fact, reducing taxes. And in addition to thaton top of that, they're going to say we have to cut 25 percent of every program across the board, I don't know what there's much to negotiate on.
But I'm preparedI told the Speaker as soon as he's about ready to lay out his budget, I'm willing to sit down. And now I'm hearing things like, ""Well, we're not going to have our budget till April or May, maybe even June.""
All this talk pushing me to get my budget done. I said I'd have it done by the 9th; I had it done by the 9th. I handed it to you guys. I handed it to them. Why, all of a sudden, can't they get it done in March or maybe even April or maybe even May?
I mean, I don'tI don't know. It doesn't sound like they're on the level yet.
So thank you very much.
Middle East Peace Process 
Q. Mr. President, what are your thoughts on Saudi Arabia and Iran reestablishing diplomatic relations, sir?
The President. The better the relations between Israel and thetheir Arab neighbors, the better for everybody.
Q. Will you sign the bill the House just unanimously approved on COVID-19?

2023-01-20 00:00:00,Remarks to the United States Conference of Mayors and a Question-and-Answer Session,"
The President. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. You'd better sit down. You don't want this going to my head. [Laughter] A kid from Scranton.
Look, Mayor Suarez, thank you for your leadership at the conference.
[At this point, the President cleared his throat.]
Excuse me, I've got a little frog in my throat. Butand, Andy, thank you for that introduction.
You know, it's wonderful to finally welcome all of you to the White House after not being able to because of the pandemic for so long. We appreciate it a great deal.
And some of you know I started my career as a county councilman in the State of Delaware. And then I ran for the U.S. Senate because serving as a local official was too hard. [Laughter] They know where you live[laughter]and knock on your door. And I've always had enormous respect for the job you do.
And by the way, Suarez, you and I have something else in common. Do you know what it is? We both married way above our station. [Laughter] Way, way above our station. [Laughter] You all think I'm kidding. Some things are just self-evident. [Laughter]
Todaytodayis 2 years since I was sworn in as President. [Applause] Noand with your helpwith your help, we've gotten a lot done. I think if you look around the room, we've got a lot of Cabinet members who were mayors. A lot of mayors.
You've got old Mitch Landrieu from New Orleans down there, you know. And hethat's like being mayor of a country. [Laughter]
Yes, I'll tell you what. My daughter went down to Tulane University in large part because his dadit's a long story, butwhen he was mayor. And I thought she was going to come home talking with, boy, talking funny at me, you know what I mean, from[laughter]from Bayou Lafourche or something.
And Ibutand Mayor Pete is[applause]even though he's the Secretary, they still call him ""Mayor Pete."" And you know, you've got Marty Walsh from Boston. I don't know where Marty is. We've got a lot of mayorsa lot of mayors. And that's why I think we're making such progress.
Look, the fact is that, you know, I wasit's fitting that we are here together today because you mayors know how to get things done. And that's not hyperbole; it's a fact. Because you have no choice, as a matter of fact.
Yesterday I was in California wheregrappling with historic
Audience member. [Inaudible]
The President. California. Started offthe Governor looked at me, and he said, ""Mr. President, we used to be the fifth largest economy in the world, and now we're the fourth""and that's true""in the world."" I'll tell you what. So I genuflected, and we moved on. [Laughter]
I said, ""That means you don't need that $10 billion we just gave you, right?"" [Laughter] And you all think I'm kidding. That's what we did: $10 billion. But all kidding aside, he's a great Governor and has[inaudible]well. But look, dealing with historic storms and flooding.
You know, when your town or city faces a crisis, it's the mayor who gets the first call. And I've seen it. I've traveled this country after floods and tornadoes, wildfires, hurricanes.
As a matter of fact, I was kidding, but there's a serious piece to it. When I pointed out thatto the Governor, ""We've got to stop taking these helicopter rides."" Because I went overI think it was the fifth one in his State, traveling the State. And more of the forest has burned down there upand in Oregon than the entire State of Missouri. I mean, it's a long, long, long way. A lot of damage.
And I want to thank the mayors across the country for doing everythingeverything they can to recover and rebuild. It matters that the ones whoyou're the ones who make sure, as trite as it sounds, that the garbage gets picked up, the potholes get fixes, the buses that you can catch to work and be able to continue to be there on time, and so much more of significant consequence.
But those things are consequential. You affect people's quality of life more than any other group of people in the world. And mayors know the measure of success isn't how many partisan points you score, it's how many problems you fixcan you fix the problem.
When I came to office, we had a lot problems to fix. The
[The President experienced technical difficulties with the microphone.]
Can you hear me?
The pandemic was raging. Our economy was reeling. But we acted together. Now, 2 years in, it's clearer than ever that our plan is working. We're building the economy from the bottom up and the middle out. Not just the top down.
Because when we do that, by the way, the wealthy do very, very well. And everybodythe poor have a shot, and the middle class can have a little breathing room. An economy that benefits the folks in the Heartland as well as in our cities and all across America.
And you know, I rememberyou know, Ias I said, my familyI was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania. When coal died when I was in third grade, we had to move. But I go back to Scranton. Everybody isthe joke is: They're from Scranton. Everybody is from Scranton.
But think of all the towns you knowand some of you are mayors ofthat they go through school; they want to stay where their family is, where their relatives are, where they know everything; and they have to say: ""Mom, I've got to leave. There's no jobs here. There's no jobs here in my town."" I'm serious. I'm deadly earnest.
And what we're trying to do is not just rebuild an economy, but bring back the pridethe prideand the sense of belonging and the sense of ""I want to stay where I livewhere I live now, where I'm able to do what I want to do."" And that's the whole purpose of what we're trying to do.
In our cities, when people used to move outbut you know, now they're beginning to move back in. Cities are growing. Not just big cities, small towns as well.
The economy that rewards work, where we don't need a college degree to provide for your family. It helps to have that college degree, but you don't need it to provide for your family.
Two years ago this week, 18 million people were out of work2 years ago this week. Now thethat number is under 1.6 million, near the lowest level in decades. The unemployment rate is as low as it's been in 50 years. We've created 11 million jobs, 750,000 manufacturing jobs. Where in the hell is it written to say we can't be the manufacturing capital of the world in this? I'mI mean it. Not a joke.
I got so sick and tired of us exporting jobs and importing product. We're now importing jobs and exporting product. That's what we're going to dothat's what we're doing. No, I really mean it. Because we're beginning to invest in ourselves again, because of you all.
Over the last 2 years, more Americans applied to start a small business than any year in historyany year on record. They make up 50 percent of all the economy in America.
Fewer families are facing foreclosure and eviction beforethan before the pandemic. Families in our communities are starting to breathe just a little bit easier.
But, folks, it's not only that. Pride is coming back to American communities and to American cities. And that's not just on the coasts, as I said. It's in every part of the country, including many towns and cities and local communities that have been forgotten for much too longmuch too long.
And it's not an accident. It's a strategy that, when I came to officea strategy that we stuck to even in the face of a lot of criticism. A strategy that we put into action. A strategy to recover and rebuild and invest in America.
You know, hesitate a secondjust to digress a little bit. We used to invest 2 percent of our GDP in research and development every year. That's what we did in America. But then, along the way, we stopped. We stopped investing in America, in research and development. We invest now seven-tenths of 1 percent.
We used to be number one. Now China is number two. We're number eightI mean, there'sthe things we've allowed to happen. It's not been conscious. It just, sort of, slipped up on us. We justand the way in which we changed the way we dealt with corporate law. A whole range of things. But we're changing it. And we're changing it. As I said, we're going to export product, not jobs.
With your support, I signed into law the American Rescue Plan to deliver immediate economic relief to families and communities that needed it most. One study found that before the law was passed, 70 percent of the mayors in America expected to cut critical jobs like teachers and transit workers. Twenty-seven percent of you were facing steep cuts in police department budgets. So we acted.
And with the CARES Act we passed under the previous administration, some of it had to go to youryou had to go to your legislatures for permission to get the money.
I've been the bad guy when I was a Senator and as Vice Presidenta pain in the neck. Why do you have to go through the legislature? [Laughter] No, no, I'm serious. I'm deadly earnest about that. Because if you go through the legislature, you can't blame them. They say, ""I want a piece of my district."" But you can apply directly.
[Inaudible]when I wrote the COPS bill years ago. You didn't have to go to the legislature or your Governor to determine. You could apply directly. If you qualified, you got it directly. You got the money directly. Well, that's what we're talking about. And things are beginning to change.
Instead, we made sure the American Rescue Plan empowered you directlydirectly. To avoid painful layoffs, you put cops back on the street, firefighters back into jobs. You kept teachers in classrooms. You asked for the money, and you qualified for it.
In Knoxville, Tennessee, Mayor Kincannon gave a premium payis the mayor here?
Mayor Indya Kincannon of Knoxville, TN. Yes, I'm right here.
The President. There you are, Mayor. Well, you gave premium pay to police officers and firefighters to keep them on the job. It was a big deal.
In Mesa, Arizona, Mayor GilesI don't know whether the mayor is here. I'm going to get people in trouble calling this out. There[laughter]. Mr. Mayor, how are you? Bought five new ambulances, hired behavioral health clinicians to help the fire department in crisis calls.
And by the way, you know, when a cop turns up in a domestic violence case or someone is on astanding on edge of bridge, they don't need a cop. They need a psychologist with them. That's why we're putting more peopleno, I'm serious.
We're beginning to understand this all again. And a lot of you are applying for the money and using it for these mental health issues as well. You know, there are countless examples.
When it comes to public safetywhen it comes to public safetywe know the answer is not to defund the police. [Applause] Not to defund the police. It's to retrain some police. It's to make sure there's accountability. It's to make sure we know exactly what's happened. But it's not to defund the police. They need more funding, and they need ancillary help as well.
And so the American Rescue Plan$350 billion of State and local governmentsand we urged them to makeit was available to themto make communities safer.
It turned out thatone of the largest investments in public safety ever. And every single Republican in Congress voted against it. But a lot of the mayors saidyou talked to your representative and said, ""Whoa, whoa, whatthat, you knowit may be Biden's idea, but itnot all his ideas are bad."" [Laughter] Oh, you think I'm kidding? I'm not kidding. You know. [Laughter]
Many cities from Newark, New Jersey; to Baton Rouge, Louisiana[laughter]but all kidding asidehave made major investments in community violence intervention initiatives. These studies have shown, in some cases, they can reduce violent crime up to 60 percent, particularly among our youth. It doesn't always do that much, but it can do thatthat much.
But as you mayors know better than most, when you see these problems of crime and the opioid epidemic, you know that a big part of that is mental healthmental health. And I want to take a moment to talk to you about how we're addressing that as well.
By the way, Vivek Murthy, the Surgeon General, has been really focusing on this a great deal. A lot of you have worked with him.
Through the American Rescue Plan, we've provided initial funding for cities to start to address some of the mental health needs arising from the pandemic: $5 billion for States and community organizations to deliver mental health and substance abuse treatment; $103 million in funding specifically to address mental health on frontfor frontline health professionals, like nurses.
You've readin your communities, you've dealt with your hospitals where the nurses are just overworked and having serious, serious problems, in terms of their own mental health.
But we know it wasn't enough. So the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, and we went even further. That provides $10 billion to address mental health needs; $2 billion of that is for young people in particular to pay for things like school counselors.
And we know what fentanyl is doing to families and communities all across the country. We've worked hard to make sure the first responders have what they need when they respond to overdoses for young people who are dying.
And by the way, we've confiscated enormousan enormous amount of fentanyl, not just at the border, but beyond the border. We've confiscated throughoutI think it'slet me get the number here. I don't want to get it wrong. We've confiscated 379 million doses of fentanyl. And by the way, 100,000and mostly kidshave died from fentanyl, and it's put in things thatthat they never anticipated it's part of.
As mayors, as you know how much this matters. This is why I brought many former mayors into the administration. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms is here. I said it was harder being mayor of Atlanta than being President, but I don't know. [Laughter] I'mI'm onlyonly kidding.
But all kidding aside, well, whatshe's a Senior Adviser on Public Engagement, led the cities through the pandemic. She makes sure to bring the perspective of local officials and community leaders to decisions we make here at the White House.
Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, a former mayor in Iowa, is strengthening our Nation's rural communities. And he really is. He's a smart, smart guy. He knows what he's doing. And heI know he's the Secretary of Agriculture, but what he's doing: American grocery stores are stocked while American farmers thrive, and our young people have access to food when schools are closed.
Secretary of Housing and Urban Affairs Marcia Fudge. Marcia is right here. She's got a hell of a job. A former mayor in Ohioworking veryworking very hard to close the wealth gap, expanding efforts to build generational wealth through home ownership.
How did all the mainstream middle class people get their wealth? Ninety percent of them through investing in their homes. They were able to buy a home. They built equity in their home. That's how they were able to borrow to get their kids to school. That's how they built their equity. Well, the same thing is happening now, and she's working really hard to provide that opportunity. And as well as combating homelessness, which a lot of you are dealing with on your streets.
And while folks continue to recover, we're also rebuilding. Mitch Landrieu, the former mayor of New Orleans who was president of this organization, is now my Senior Adviser and Infrastructure Coordinator to help me rebuild America through a once-in-a-generation bipartisan infrastructure bill. It's always hard to make[applause]. He's and working with all of you to modernize our Nation's roads, highways, bridges, railroads, airports, ports, water systems, thethe internet, and so much more.
Last year alone, nearly 7,000 projects were identified and are underway with funding from the infrastructure law. By the end of this year, that will be more than 20,000more than 20,000.
If I can say it again for a second, to digress slightly: One of the things I've been telling the pressand they look at me, likewell, they look at me like I'm wonderful, right? [Laughter]
No, allno, all kidding aside, why I keep saying it: We did a lot last year with your help. It's only now beginning to bear fruit, because we passed this infrastructure bill. That's a 10-year bill, and it's taking time to get it off the ground.
Mitch McConnell and I just announced the construction of a new bridgea billion dollarsacross the Ohio River. It's going to fundamentally change transportation north and south not just from Ohio and Kentucky, but across the Nation.
So many things are happening. We passed the bill relating to the cost of insulin. Well, guess what? Only now, as of January 1, a lot of people are waking up and finding out, if they're on Medicare, they only have to pay 35 bucks a month instead of 400 bucks a month to save their lives.
And I want the drug companies to be able to make money, but I tell you what, they have to be able to explain when they raise the price that asbeyond inflation, that they've invested more money in what they did in order to justify the price. Otherwise, guess what? We're going to go back and get it from them[laughter]under the law. No, I'm serious. I'm serious.
We're so we're doing things that just make some common sensejust some common sense because you all.
Labor Secretary Marty Walsh, former mayor of Boston
[The President briefly imitated a Boston accent.]
He's parking his cars. I kid Marty. But he's making sure these projects have prevailing wage and purporting them to move and suggest for significant apprenticeships so people can make a living off of what they're doing.
And then, by the way, I'm going to talk in a minute about thedealing with the whole idea of what we're doing in terms of new investments and thewith the CHIPS legislation.
Well, one of the leading investors of overI think it's, so far, $22 billion in the United States is from another country. I said, ""Why are you investing in America?"" He said, ""Because you got the best workers, and you're the safest environment in the world in which we can do this.""
So we're helping to rebuild our economy with jobs that don't require 4-year degrees, promoting an economy that works for middle class and working class Americans.
Transportation Secretary Pete is here. Look, we know thebetter known as ""Mayor Pete""[laughter]but he's working with many of you to address those quality-of-life issues that really matter to people you serve, not just through big bridges and highway projects, but throughthough they're importantbut also through smaller projects that are critical to your cities.
Like in Madison, Wisconsin, where Mayor Rhodes-Conway is buying 46 electric buses, replacing those dirty dieselsbad for the health of the environmentand making it clear. No, I'm serious. It's a big deal. Or helping the city rebuild airport. There you are, okay.
Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway of Madison, WI. Thank you, Mr. President.
The President. Well, thank you.
And it means our kids aren't going to be inhaling that diesel fumes when they get off the bus. For real. It matters. Environmentally, it matters as well.
And so, you know, we're helping cities rebuild airport terminals in Atlanta with Mayor Andre Dickens, in Orlando with Mayor Buddy Dyer, in L.A. with Karen Bass.
And, with the leadership of Vice President Harris, we're partnering with you to deliver affordable high-speed internet to every single household in Americaaffordable high-speed internetso no parent has to park in front of a McDonald's whento do the homework with their kid when they're onwhen the school is not in session, when they can't go to school. It's a big deal.
It's a big deal for farmers, I might add, and a whole lot of other people that know exactly what products are costing and selling for. And now we're50 million households have affordable internet that they didn't have just before we passed the law.
We're also making the biggest investment everever, everin climate: the Inflation Reduction Act. We're creating millions of good-paying jobs and investing in fence-line communities that have suffered the most as a consequence of being smothered by pollution. Think of the ""Cancer Alley"" in Louisiana or Route 9 in Delaware, where all those facilities are. Well, we've made a commitment. We're going to invest, first and foremost, as we clean up those communities[inaudible]go to the people from that community. And we're going to invest in that community to make that community better again.
Our economic agenda ignited a manufacturing boom, the semiconductor boom, the battery boom, the electric vehicle boom. We're making things in America again and in every part of America, cities large and small.
The mayor of Phoenix, Kateis Kate here? Thank you, Kate, for being here. I was with her last month to announce a small investment: $40 billion[laughter]$40 billion invested by TSCTMSC [TSMC; White House correction], the two semiconductor factories and thousands of union workers helping to build them.
And, Andy, you know, Ithe ""field of dreams"" outside of Columbus, where Intel is investingit's a hundred acres, but they're investing $20 billion to expand semiconductor manufacturing. I said a hundreda thousand acres. I dubbed itI didn't mean to; I shouldn't havebut I said this is a ""field of dreams."" It is. It's a field of dreams.
And by the way, of those jobs, aboutof those 12,000 jobs, 7,000 are construction jobs. But guess what? They're paying prevailing wage. And those 5,000 jobs left, the average salary at those places, they tell me, are going to be 123,000 bucks a year, and you don't need a college degree to do those jobs.
This is, in part, urged by all of you. This is happening in no smallsmall part because of bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act. Everybody signed on. The folks who joined me at the bill signing and other victories, with your support, so many of you signed the firstwe've signed the first major gun legislation in 30 years.
Now I'll say what I've said before, and not all of you are going to agree with me, but we're going to ban assault weapons. I did it once, and we're going to do it again. And the number of bullets that can be in a clip.
On Sunday, we acknowledge what would have been the 50th anniversary of Roe v. Wade. We're continuing to fight and protect a woman's right to choose.
Last year[applause]and last year, when I held the first-of-its-kind White House summit, at the request of others, against hate-fueled violence, this group led the effort with 150 mayors to sign a compactDemocrats, Republicans, and Independentsto prevent and address this type of violence in our communities. I'm committed to continuing this work with all of you, but I need you badly.
But there's more to do. As was mentioned by theby your president, immigration is another major issue affecting many of your communities, particularly border communities and nearand near communities.
I visited the border earlier this month, the first time as President. I've been there before, but for the first time as President. And I'm taking action where I have the legal capacity to do so. I'll continue to call on Congress to act to pass comprehensive immigration reform to fix the system.
The first bill I introduced was a comprehensive reform legislation on immigration. But because of some in the Congress, they refused to consider it. They found it a better issue to campaign on than an issue to solve.
So we have a choice: They can keep using immigration to try to score political points, or we can help solve the problem. Immigration reform used to be a bipartisan issue. And we can make it that again, in my view.
Let me close with this: I ran for office for three reasons. One wasand I waseven my campaign team thought I was wrong, in terms of what the basis upon which I was running. But one of the things afteryou know, Iwhen I got elected as a 29-year-old kid to the SenateI had to wait to belegally beto be able to be sworn in, because I wasn't old enough. No joke. Iyou know, I wasthey talked about, you know, my being the, you know, the youngest; I wasn't. There was one younger, elected popularly, than I was.
But you know, I spent a lot of timeI used to get asked all the time, Mr. Mayor, ""What's the secret?"" Because if I won against a really good guy, he was a decent man, we never had a cross word with us[inaudible]a progressive Republican who helped write the Clean Water and Clean Air Act, et cetera. But we had disagreements on a number of other things. And second time I ran, he actually endorsed me.
But the point of this isit's simple. I used to get asked, ""What's thethere must be a secret. If you could have won, there must be some secret.""
And I used to think about it, that people, for the next 3, 4 years would ask me that, who were running for office in Delaware. And I finally figured it out. And you all are successful, and you know it. I said: ""The secret is, have you figured out what's worth losing over? Have you figured out what's so important to you, you'd rather lose than win and have to compromise on it?""
And so, when I ran this timeand I had not planned on running again, and all you were probably saying, ""Why the hell didn't you follow your instinct?""[laughter]but I honest to God didn't. My son had passed away, and I had no desire toI was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania. Things were going fine.
To make a long story short, when I did, I decided there were three reasons to run. And I mean it. One was to restore the soul of Americathe decency, honor, the idea we could deal with one another. No, I genuinely mean it.
[Inaudible]the wayand I've been this way my whole careerhow we build the economy, from the bottom up and the middle out. For real. Ilook, I come from the State of corporate America. More corporations are incorporated in my State than every other one of your States combined. Combined. And I got elected seven times there though. So, you know, it wasn't I was anticorporate, but I have a different view in terms of what the priority should be.
And so, as I said, when the middle does well, they generate hope, give chance to the working class. And when they do well, the wealthy do very, very well.
Well, and the third reason I ran, which has beenturned out to be the hardest to deal with, and that's unite the country. We are a democracy. We cannot be sustained if we stay 50 different islands or two different parties that no longer talk to one another.
For the last 2 years since my Inauguration, I think we made some progress, in large part because of many of you sitting in this room. And I'm really optimistic in the year ahead that we're implementing the laws we've already passed, we will deliver real benefits, and people are going to feel them in their everyday lives.
You know, that work we're going to continue to do together. Together, we're proving that every city and town in this country, our best days are ahead of us, not behind us. And I really mean it.
I was asked by my senior teamand Pete will remember it: If I could do anything to change the attitude of optimism in America, what was the one thing I'd do? Just if I could change one thing. It's going to sound bizarre what I tell you. I said I'd cure cancer. And they looked at me like, ""Well, cure cancer?"" Because nobody thinksit's the most frightening thing to people. And if we did it, America can do big things again.
There's nothing beyond our capacity. I swear to God. There is nothing beyond the capacity of the United States of America. Remember who in hell we are. We're the United States of America. When we work together, there's nothing beyond our capacity. Nothing, nothing, nothing. So we've got to work together, folks.
God bless you all; may God protect our troops. And now I'm going to turn it over to Julie. Thank you.
They gave me a different mike they can turn off. So I[laughter].
Office of Intergovernmental Affairs Director Julie Chvez Rodriguez. Thank you so much, Mr. President. And now we have a couple of questions that we will take from a couple of mayors.
We'll start with Mayor Tishaura Jones from St. Louis, Missouri.
Mayor Tishaura O. Jones of St. Louis, MO. Good afternoon, Mr. President.
The President. Mayor, how are you?
Federal Debt and Deficit/Tax Code Reform/Public Debt Limit/Entitlement Programs/Education/Federal Support for Municipalities 
Mayor Jones. Great. Great. Thanks to the bipartisan infrastructure law and the CHIPS and Science Act, we're seeing jobs return to our cities, and we're preparing our citizens for the many opportunities to come. What can we as mayors do to help you further your agenda of shoring up our national security and bring more high-quality jobs to America's cities?
The President. I think two things. One, be realistic and don't confuse the national debt with debt reduction on a yearly basis.
The debt we're paying onand we're going to have a little discussion about that with thewith the new majority leader of the Househas accumulated over 200 years. Over 200 years. Not a joke. That's how longthat's whatthat's what the national debt is. It's over, you know, $31 trillion, but it's over 200 years.
And one-quarter of that debtone-quarter of that debt was accumulated in the 4 years of my predecessor. One-quarter of it.
So what we've actually done, Mayor, we've actually cut the deficit on a yearly basis. In the first year, because of what younow, I'm not being solicitousbecause of what you all did$350 billion. And last yearthis year, we cut that deficit on a yearly basis by over a trillion dollars. So it's over a trillionroughlyfour hundred billion dollars we've cut the deficit, the yearly deficitthe year to year.
We've got to focus on making sure we do not accumulate more debt on the historic 200 years and gradually continue to reduce it.
One of the things that we've done is, thethe budget we're going to be introducing, and you all are going to see, is expected to reduce the debt another trillion dollars this next year by spending morespending less than we spending less than we bring in.
Now, the big debateand I'll be honest with you, and I'm going to talk about in the State of the Unionis a fundamental disagreement on what we should do to cutwhat do we cut? Well, it's not just cutting. What do you raise? What taxes do people pay? How do they pay their taxes, and do they pay it fairly?
And so one of the things that's going to be a big issue in dealing with the national debt that couldif we don't meet our national debt and renege on the first time, we have a calamity that exceeds anything that's ever happened financially in the United States.
And so one of the things that we're going to do is, it's going to get down to a decision of whether do we, in fact, make sure that folksdo we cut Social Security to raise taxes on trillionaires? I mean, billionaires. There's 745 or -50 billionaires in America. Average tax rate they pay is 2 percent. I think you should be able to be a billionaire, but I think you should pay a little more than 2 percent.
No, no, II'mand by the way, I'm not trying toas Mayor Duggan knows me well, I'm not trying to be alarming about it. But, I mean, it's a reality.
Now, the argumentthere's a lot of arguments why that shouldn't be, because they generate so much energy and so much growth, et cetera. But there's a lot of things we can do.
Now, the option that's beingis going to be offered, you're going to see, is they want tothe way to deal with cutting that debt is to cut Social Security, cut Medicaid. We've got to do something about Social Security andno, butbut this isthese are the kind of debates we're going to have. And they're going to be honest debates.
For you, it seems to mefor a mayor, the things that I believeand I have not been a mayor, but I think I've watched long enough to know the difference between great ones like you and folks who don't do much[laughter]or don'tI shouldn't say ""don't do much."" I shouldn't say that. Who have had more difficultyis focus on the things that make your city unique and make it grow.
What are the things that make it grow? Well, first of all, let meI could go on, but I'm just going to give you one example. We're in a situation where, if you were aone of the reasons why America became the most advanced and economically prosperous nation in the 21st century: We're the first nation in the world have a universal education systemgrades 1 through 12. Now, others had systems that were superior to ours, in terms of their exclusiveness, but not universal.
Now, I wonder if anybodyif today we were starting off and saying, ""Oh, we're going to decidewe decide we're going to have to have a universal education system,"" would anybody think, in the second quarter of the 21st century, that 12 years was enough to compete?
Audience member. No.
The President. I don't think so. ForI mean, for real.
So a lot of you are doing a lot of experimental work, in terms of not just pre-K, but you're doing it in terms of educationteaching kids to read, write, add, and subtract at 3 and 4 and 5 years old, and notand you're focusing on apprentice programs after college.
You're focusing onI mean, after high school. And you're focusing in high school on allowing people to learn trades instead ofremember, there used to be eveneven you're old enough to remember, they'renot you, Mayor. [Laughter]
But when, you know, there were shop classes in school where people learned whether they couldif they're comfortable working with their hands, whether theyso there's a lot of things that we can do in education.
There's a lot of things you can also do in terms of dealing withI'm going to get you a lot more money, God willing, because I think we have universal support for it, beyond the money that came out of the original legislation. There's proposal that I've just presented toI'm the guy that wrote the community policing law, but got very bad publicity.
But guess what? People are figuring outguess what?it works. The people who most need the help, the most victimized are the poorest communities. So we need cops in those communities from those communities, but cops that are held accountable to everything that they say we're supposed to do. And we can do that.
So, focusing on law enforcement that, in fact, is equitable; focusing onyou know, for example, nationally, I still think we should have the George Floyd legislation, but I didn't able to do that. So what I was able to doI said no-knock warrants are limited significantly. We're in a situation where you have tono chokeholds. There are certain basic things.
You know, when I was coming up as a kid, you know, cops were learned toyou know, required to learn to shoot to kill. Well, you ought to be able to shoot to stop. You know? Everything shouldn't be an extreme. There'sso the way we train police officers is changing.
And there's a lot of things you can look at to determine whether or not you can affect the safety of your city. And also, I think thatwell, I'm not going to go on, butso there's a lot of things you can do. Because I believe you'll have the economic wherewithal, through the programs and the Federal Government not telling you what to do, but giving you the wherewithal to do the things that you think most need to be done. And every community has a slightly different needa slightly different need, in terms of emphasis.
And you know, I think one of the great mayors in the country is Duggan from Detroit. Not a joke. I got aI wasI'll tell you what: He inherited a hell of a situation. And I remember Barack Obama turned to me one day and saidnot a joke""Joe, fix Detroit."" I said, ""Oh, no problem."" [Laughter] ""No problem.""
Well, I got to know Detroit. I found out things the mayor taught me wasguess what?that something was as close to 70 percent of the people in this60 percent of the people in the city who were high school educated, had jobsthey were outside the city. And they couldn't get there. They didn't have60 percent of them didn't have cars. So we ended up gettingwhat?20 new buses, was it, initially?
I mean, you know, just practical things to determine what are the things that both allow neighborhoods to stay united and move.
And, again, there's a lotand one of the things that Mayor Landrieu, as I still call him the ""mayor,"" but he's much more than that. He's running this show for me, because we also haveI can't remember theI asked for the phone number, and I forgot it.
Senior Adviser and Infrastructure Act Implementation Coordinator Mitchell J. Landrieu. Eight-eight-one 
The President. Eight-eight-one
Senior Adviser Landrieu. eight-nine
The President. eight-nine
Senior Adviser Landrieu. four-six.
The President. four-six.
That you can call because we have people in hereno, nono, I'm not joking. A lot of people know we have these programs, but they're hard to navigate. So you can pick up the phone and call. ""How do I get the money to do A, B, C, or D? Can I do this with that?""to cut through the red tape.
Anyway, I hope I answered
Director Rodriguez. Thank you.
The President. [Laughter] You're about to cut me off.
Director Rodriguez. Thank you, Mr. President. We do have one more question from Mayor Schieve, from Reno, Nevada.
Mayor Hillary L. Schieve of Reno, NV. Hi, thank you. So, first of all, thank you for inviting us to your home. We love what you've done with the place. [Laughter] It's beautiful.
And also, I want to say thank you
The President. You like museums, right? [Laughter]
Mayor Schieve. I want to say thank you from the bottom of all of our hearts. I know everyone in the room is so grateful that you have brought mayors into your Cabinet. I think it should be a requirement of every President.
Mayor Landrieu, I love you. Mayor Pete, I love you. And I honestly believe, like, more has been done because of that. And so thank you so much for your leadership. We are so grateful.
The President. We have, what, sixsix mayors in Cabinet positions?
Mayor Schieve. I think six. All right, maybe we can get to 12? [Laughter]
The President. Well, we have
Mayor Schieve. I know six more in here that would like to come.
The President. We have more women than men. [Laughter]
Mayor Schieve. See? Love that too. Love that too.
So you talked a little bit about mental health, and I want to say thank you so much for your leadership on that. It means the world to me. We are so fortunate to work with your Surgeon General. He is fantastic. He is fantastic.
So all your mayors in the room are going to become mental health warriors. And we're going to be addressing addiction and loss and grief. And I'm going to ask you something very personal. You've had a lot of loss and grief in your life. And I know over the last few years, a lot of Americans have had a lossa lot of loss and grief because of the pandemic.
What would be yourwhat wouldwhat would you say to them, and your advice to someone experiencing personal loss and grief?
The President's Advice on Dealing With Loss and Grief/Support for Families With Young Children/Mental Health 
The President. Well, first of all, as close staff knows, I spend a lot of time with folks who have gone through losswife, daughter, husband, children, et cetera.
And, granted, I did lose my wife and daughter right after I got elected to the Senate. A tractor trailer broadsided them, killed my wife and daughter. And my two boys were little boys; they were on top of their deceased mom and sister for a long while because it took themy local fire department a long time to get the ""Jaws of Life"" to get them out.
And then Ithe guy who should be standing here, if there was any Biden who was going to be Presidentand I'm notit's not hyperboleis my son Beau. He's more qualified than I was.
Andbut he decidedI'll never forget. He asked me one Friday, he said, ""Dad, what are you doing on Friday?"" And I said, ""What do you need?"" He said, ""I'd like you to swear me in."" I said: ""Swear you in? You're attorney general of the State of Delaware. Swearing you in to what?"" He said, ""I joined the United States National Guardthe Delaware National Guard.""
And then, when theyhis unit got sent, he didn't have to go, but he got an exemption to go as long as he gave up the seat. And you know, that was tough. But you know what? I had family. I had an incredible wife. No man deserves one great love, let alone two. And I had a mom and a dad and a sister and a brother who were alive.
And, for example, when Iwhen the accident happened, early onmy sister is my best friend in the world. Gave up her home, and she and her husband moved into my house to help me raise my kids. Without being asked, just moved in andand by the way, 5 days after I was married, they were gone. [Laughter]
But I say that not about me, but it's about what mental health does. I had people around me that were there to help me. I was lucky.
I stilleverybody thinks I commuted every day forI've traveled over 1,200,000 miles on Amtrak. Not a joke. I commuted every single day for 36 yearsand then beyond that, as Vice Presidentto go home. Everybody thought I gotwent home becauseI went home because I couldn't afford two places. But, anywayno[laughter].
I went home because I'd get to, you know, kiss my boys goodnight and lay down, we'd say our prayers. And then my daughter, et cetera. But I had my mother. I had my mother there. Every morning, I'd drop the boys off when they were little at my mom's house. And then later, I'd be able to drive them to school, and they'd be picked up. But my point is, I had so much help. And I had psychological help.
Everywhere and down, there was someone there to, basically, hold my hand. Well, that's the mental health that a lot of families don't have. They don't have.
And a lot of folks are in a situation where if they just had somebody to talk to, they just hadand that's why I think some of the things we can do that can also help families going through some really difficult times is, for example, a preschool education. Reading, writing, arithmeticage 3.
That does two things. It helps your kid get an advantage, but it also helps mom or dad or a single parent or parents who are going through hell to have somebody there until 5 o'clock taking care of your kid by thewhile they're learning.
So there's a lot of things that it does, that gives peoplebut in addition to that, people who have gone through really tough times with drug addiction and a whole range of other thingsalcoholismthey also are in a situation where they find themselves being able to have the kind of medical help that is needed in the mental health side of it.
And so I just think having people to reach out who are professionals, who know how to deal with people going through trauma, tragedy, or self-inflicted wounds that they've had. And Iand it makes a gigantic difference.
The need forI mean, look at what's happened. And I think weI sometimes underestimate it because I stopped thinking about it, but I'm sure you don't: We lost 1over 1 million people in several years to COVID.
What that means isand the study was done that there are eight people close to every one of thoseon averagethose 1 million people. How many mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, uncle, aunts, got up in the morning or sat down for dinner at night and there was an empty chair? How many? And what impact does that have on the rest of the family?
And there's a lot of tricks that you can be taughta lot of things you can do to engage the children who survive, engage the children who aren't addicted, engage the parent whoso I just think there's so many things that you can do.
And the reason I gave you my personal story was: I think it's just about knowing somebody is there, knowing somebody you can reach out to when you get scared and hold their hand. Whether it's a drug problem, whether it's a physical problem, whether it's just aand by the way, my wife Jill got very engaged with the Brits and theand U.S. military in dealing with trying to convince peoplethink of the military. The one thing you're taught to, as a warrior, is never complain, never explain, man. Don't complain. Well, guess what? Mental health is a problem. It's a serious problem. You have more people dying of suicide in the United States military than any other reason todaymore people.
And so we got involved in reaching out to help families so that you don't make itand then I'll conclude with this. We have to take the stigma off of mental health. Mental health is no different than you break your arm or your leg.
Audience member. That's right.
The President. No, it really isn't. It's the God's truth. It is a problem that is a medical problem.
And so hardest part is to get peoplea lot of peopleI'd say most peopleto sayto acknowledge that ""I'm getting help."" I'm getting help. That's why we had this effort to dealmy wife dealt with this program to provide for health for, you know, posttraumatic stress for so many warriors. Pete, you toted a rifle, man. You were there. You see all the people.
I don't know how many people thatyou justthat need the help. But theyit's a help that you need any more than you need if you broke your leg. But we've got to take the stigma awaythe stigma away from the notion that you need mental health. Because it's no different.
And by the way, think of this: How many folks do you know, how many cops on your department need some mental health because they're suffering from posttraumatic stress, what they went through?
I mean, we don't look at them and say, you know, ""They're weak."" But you know, it's just aboutanyway, we just got to reach out and change the notion of a stigma associated with the notion of seeking mental health. And it starts early.
When youyou can detect, with children, whether they need some guidance reallyor, it doesn't mean they're, quote, ""crazy""; it means they have some disposition that has to be treated. And there's a lot that can be done.
I'm talking too much. I apologize, guys. Thank you all very much for doing this.

2023-01-19 00:00:00,"Remarks on Storm Recovery Efforts and an Exchange With Reporters in Aptos, California","
The President. Well, Governor, you and I have got to stop taking these helicopter rides. We've made a bunch of them. You've been hitif anybody doubts the climate is changing, then they must have been asleep for the last couple of years.
I want to thank you, Governor. You and I, along with the Vice President, have been in close touch since this storm hit and even before it hit, when we were talking about it coming. We told the Governor that we'd do everything we can, whatever he needs. But he's been through a whole hell of a lot.
I don't know what, we had three or four flights up and down the State for the wildfires and the damage done. And it's been astounding what you've done.
And I want to say what I said then, and I'll say again: The Federal Government is not leaving its responsibility until it's all fixed, it's done.
You know, Mr. Mayoror, Madam Mayor, I want to thank you and the county supervisors and local officials, the first responders for all that you have done and all you have been dealing with to try to protect your constituents in a way that gives them someI guess, maybe the thing that's most needed in these times is a sense of hope that everything is going to be able to get done, everything is going to be able to be fixed.
And I want to thank the entire California delegation for working with my administration. Alex and Jimmy, thank you for youwhat you've done, being with me today.
And you know, we did an aerial tour of the damage. And unlike when we did the aerial tour of the fires, it's not as obvious from the air just how much damage has been done. You getwe flew over the entire area and parts of the Statethe entireyou know, they got more rainfall in a single day than they get in an entire year in parts of the State.
Drenching rains, powerful winds, floods, landslides, but you don't feel it till you walk the streets or whatwhen you're able to walk. And you know, asyou know, toppling of thousands of trees.
Twenty thousand customers200,000 customers lost their power through the storms. Now it's less than 5,000, but it's still 5,000 people who don't have power. We've got to get it down to zero.
Nearly 150,000 people were under evacuation orders. Now it's down to 1,400 under evacuation orders. And under 300 people are still in shelters.
But, tragically, 21 people died. And that little boy, we're still trying to find. Everybody I've talked to so far today just spontaneously brings that up. You know, the fact isyou know, Jill and I have him in our prayers, the family in our prayers, and all of you.
You know, while the situation is still treacherous, we're cautiously optimistic that the worst part is behind. The waters recede, but we'll see the full extent of the damage to the homes, the businesses, and to farms and ranches.
And we nowwe know some of the destruction is going to take years to fully recover and rebuild. But we've got tojust not rebuild, we've got to rebuild better. We've got to rebuild better.
Last week, I signed an expedited major disaster declaration for the State of California. Yesterday I directed the Federal Government that we'll cover 100 percent of the cost of removing debris and emergency measures like sheltering evacuees and paying overtime for first responders for the next 60 days.
[At this point, the President cleared his throat.]
Excuse me. For 60 days.
And right now more than 500 employees of FEMA are out hereand other Federal agencieson the ground trying to help people. FEMA positioned supplies for 100,000 meals, 100,000 liters of water, 20,000 blankets, 10,000 cots for shelters.
Andwill be disaster recovery centers in every impacted area, including in Santa Cruz and Merced, where survivors can apply for assistance and if their homes or their small businesses have been damaged. That's already underway.
The Army Corps of Engineers is helping to remove heavy debris andsafely and monitoring seven reservoirs in the Central Valley and the San Francisco Bay Area. I've instructed my administration to bring every elementevery elementof the Federal Government together with the help of immediate needs to long-term rebuilding, to do both.
We have toin terms of the infrastructure, there's got to be significant changes being made. And the Federal Government's going to be here to help get that done.
For example, the Department of Agriculture is helping farmers with disaster loans and grants if they lost livestock or their crops were washed away. The Small Business Administrationand some of you were with me when I just went through the small businesses along the piers here; it's devastating what happened, but they're going to get helphelp local businesses with low-interest loans so they can recover.
And now, if you haveif you don't have insurance or if you're underinsured, FEMA is going to get you started on home repairs and replacing lost or damaged property like cars or refrigerators, things inside the home that will be able to be replaced quickly. To apply for assistance from FEMA, you can go online to disasterassistance.govdisasterassistance.gov.
You can also sign up in person for disaster recovery centers in the coming days. There are going to be at least seven centers opened across this State, and FEMA is going to deploy Disaster Survivor Assistance teams to communities that need them the most. We can go to the FEMA website to find that location.
And look, as I've said on other disasters, the key is not just building back, it's building back stronger. Just becausesince I became President, we've spent $9 billion in disaster assistance to California for the extreme weather events they've had to go through. Nine billion.
And these weeks have shown the compounding effect of the disasters. For example, places that were ravaged by past wildfires are now at a higher risk of landslides. Extreme weather caused by climate change means stronger and more frequent storms, more intense droughts, longer wildfire seasons, all of which threaten communities across California. So we have to invest in stronger infrastructure to lessen the impacts of these disasters, because they become cumulative, in a sense.
We've already allocated funding from the infrastructure law that I signed a year ago and more than $16 billion for more than 480 projects across this State. We're making the California power grid more resilient, building stronger levees, clearing hazardous fuels, and reforesting lands, protectingto protect against wildfires.
And together, we can better prepare for future disasters, reduce the damage they cause, and [protect; White House correction] the people's lives and the livelihoods that are affected.
So let me close with this. To the people in California, I say it again: The country is here for you and with you. We are not leaving till things are built back and built back better than they were before. You can recover from storms. We'll be with you every step of the wayand I mean that sincerelyevery step.
And God bless you all, and may God protect our first responders, who we owe more than I can take time to talk about today.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Classified Documents Found at the President's Private Residence and Former Office 
Q. Mr. President, may I ask you a question about the classified documents, sir? Do you have any regretregret, sir?
The President. You know, the onlyI will answer the question, but here's the deal: You know, what quite frankly bugs me is that we have a serious problem here we're talking about. We're talking about what's going on. And the American people don't quite understand why you don't ask me questions about that.
But having said that, what's your question?
Q. Do you have any regret, sir, that you did not reveal the existence of the documents back in November, before the midterms?
The President. Just hang on, okay?
Look, as we foundwe found a handful of documents that were failedwere filed in the wrong place. We immediately turned them over to the Archives and the Justice Department. We're fully cooperating and looking forward to getting this resolved quickly.
I think you're going to find there's nothing there. I have no regrets. I'm following what the lawyers have told me they want me to do. It's exactly what we're doing. There is no there there.
Thank you. All right.

2023-01-17 00:00:00,Remarks Honoring the 2022 National Basketball Association Champion Golden State Warriors,"
The President. Hello, everyone. Please have a seat if you have it. I'm tempted to say, as honored as I am to be here speaking, I'm not sure I wouldn't be even more excited if I was standing back there. [Laughter]
Kamala, thank you very much. It feels like a Warrior home game, and that is the toughest ticket in town. [Laughter] And this has been a tough ticket to get in town.
Nancy Pelosiwhere are you, Nance? Nancy? The greatest Speaker in our history, and this is her home court right here. [Laughter]
Folks, it's so wonderful to be here.
Paulgood to see you, Paul. God love you. That's the man.
There's several other Members of the California delegation herewho are also here, and along with several city and State leaders. But as Kamala said, we're all closely monitoring the storms, the floods, the landslides all across California. And our heart is with all of the familiesall the familiesin the communities that are hurting and all the brave and historicand heroic first responders.
Working closely with Governor NewsomI'm in constant contact withand the entire delegation, I issued a disaster declaration to support recovery and to rebuild. And I'll be traveling to California on Thursday to assess the damage and see what additional support may be needed.
Difficult moments like this remind us that we are one America. We're one America. And, folks, I know the team we're honoring today understands what it takes to work together.
Let me just say that the Golden State Warriors are always welcome in this White House. Always welcome.
No more droughts. [Laughter] I mean in California.
And congratulations to the team's owner, Peter and Joe. Congratulations to the staff and coaches and fans and, most especially, to the incredible players standing behind me.
Today, the Golden State Warriors are known as one of the most successful franchises in basketball and all of sports. And four NBA titles, six finals, andin the last eight seasons. That ain't bad, man. [Laughter] That ain't bad. The stat line of a dynasty.
But the last couple of years were pretty tough. You struggled in 2020, missed the playoffs in '21, and critics wondered if this team was gone for good as a championship team. But, fellas, I know what it feels like. [Laughter] I've been there.
But, as my dad used to say: ""Joe, get up. Just get up, and never give up."" But you never gave up, and you always believed.
Coached by one of the greats, a man of courage and humilityfive rings as a player, four as a coachSteve Kerr. And by the way, he's running out of fingers. [Laughter] You all see the size of those rings? He has to walk around like this.
[At this point, the President stepped forward with his arms slung low.]
[Laughter] Well, I tell you what[laughter].
And one of the best executives in sports, Bob Myers, who rebuilt and reimagined a team around the Big 3: Steph, Draymond, and Kay [Klay; White House correction]. Well, you guys are something incredible. I mean, you add up to 72 feet? [Laughter] You're amazing. I swear to God, you're incredible. [Laughter] Who worked like hell to come back after missing two and a half seasons in injuries. You brought Andre, and you signed another group of up-and-coming stars.
In 2022, you showed what you're all about: heart and hustle. Finishing near the top of the Western Conference at the end of the regular season. In the playoffs, defeating Denver, Memphis, and Dallas. And in the finals, beating the Boston Celtics for the Warriors' seventh title in franchise history. That's pretty damn good.
And, Steph, earning your first Finals MVP award. Finals. That's not bad, man. [Laughter] How's it feel compared to all those other MVPs? [Laughter]
Guard W. Stephen Curry II. This was the best one.
The President. It was the best one? All right. [Laughter]
Well, I tell you whatit goes with his two regular season MVP awards, including the first unanimous MVP in NBA history, and cementing his place in history among the best ever.
You know, and they don't do it with a style of play that does anything other than reflect America: constant motion with individual freedom and personality that comes together as one teama team that plays with joy, with drive to be their best, and reflects the vibrancy of the Bay and the culture of our country.
And no wonderit's no wonder why millions of people at home and around the world stop and watch you play. And that's true. Wherever they can tune in, they watch.
You entertain, and above all, you do something that I don't even think you guys think about a lot: You inspire. You inspire. Unrelated to basketball, you just inspire.
And let me close with this. On Sunday, it would have been Dr. King's 94th birthday. I believeI had the great honor of being the first sitting President to deliver a sermon at Sunday service thatat his cherished Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta.
Fellas, we've been on some big stages, but that was something special and humbling for me. You could feel his spirit. You literally could feel his spirit, at least I couldhis moral vision andof a ""Beloved Community"" where we move forward and we move forward together.
It's exactly 60 years ago this month when President Kennedy hosted the Boston Celtics as the first NBA championship team to visit the White House. A few months later, in August, a Celtic legend, Bill Russell, returned to Washington, this time to stand at the Lincoln Memorial to hear Dr. King deliver his ""I Have a Dream"" speech.
I know this is the first season without Mr. Russell since his passing last year, and we miss him. But we know that all of you carry forward the through-line of greatness and service that he and Dr. King represented.
It's fitting we continue the tradition to host the day after Dr. King's holiday. Look at what this team does: speaking out against racism, standing up for equalityI mean speaking out loudly against racism; standing up for equality; encouraging people to vote; empowering children and their families to eat healthy, learn, and play in safe places; rallying the country against gun violence.
And, Coach, I want to thank you again. I want to thank you again. I really mean it. I was told his dad was a great man and professor at Beirut University and so much more. But he was a victim of gun violence. But it matters.
We always believed that America can be summed up, I believe, in a single word. I was asked by Xi Jinping on the Tibetan Plateau some years ago. He said, ""Can you define America for me?"" This is the God's truth. And I said: ""Yes, in one word: possibilities. Possibilities.""
Each of you, individually and together as a team, proved that anything is possible if we do it together. There's nothing beyond the capacity of this country if we work together. Nothing. I really mean it and believe that with my whole heart and soul.
Our national motto is E pluribus unumout of many, one. Well, you put the Dub Nation in that advice [Laughter] Strength in numbers. That's the Warrior spirit. But that's also America.
And now it's my honor to introduce someone I really admire not just as a player but as a person. And we all know the state [stat; White House correction] line of championships and MVPs. We see the highlight reelsone of the sharpest shooters to ever play the game.
But when you watch Steph Curry play, you can also see a man of character who puts in the work, who walks his faith, who loves his family, and brings people together as one of the great sportsmen of our time.
And besides that, hethe only thing he and I really have in common: We both married way above our station. [Laughter] Way above our station.
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Steph Curry.
Mr. Curry. Thank you for that, President Biden, Vice President Harris, the entire White House staff. Thank you all for welcoming us here.
The entire organizationWarriors organization, every teammate, every coach, front office, executive staff, everybody that's here celebrating with us. We are a team. We do it together. And to be able to celebrate our championship together with you here, it means a lot to bring that trophy here. It means a lot.
I think we were here 7 years ago for our first championship. So, to have another opportunity to be here, it meansit means the world. We had a connection obviously with your former boss, President Obama, with his Chicago ties and watching Coach Kerr and celebrating championships there.
But there is a connection to you. I know you grew up in Scranton, Pennsylvania. And that's 2 hours away from Philly, which is where the Warriors organization began. In 1946, we won our first championship. So we'46 has a nice ring with him[laughter]with you as the 46th President. So that is a great connection there.
And then, obviously, Vice President Harris representing Oakland, representing the Bay Area the way that we do every time we step foot on the court, which you've been able to do here in DC, it means the world.
Vice President Kamala D. Harris. Thank you.
Mr. Curry. So you are, I know, a huge fan. And you're loud with it too. And we love that. [Laughter] So we appreciate you. Keep doing
Vice President Harris. Thank you.
Mr. Curry. No, it's
Vice President Harris. Yes.
Mr. Curry. We love that. We love that spirit. And we want to continue to make you proud with everything that we do.
Vice President Harris. Thank you.
Mr. Curry. And, again, for us to be hereto find the common synergies within, you know, what we do on the court and what we represent. And when it comes to providing hope, inspiration, belief to everybody that watches us play, that's what you do in your roles leading our country.
And to continue to do exactly what you saiddo things together, continue to preach that message that's what we're all about, and obviously in the pursuit of winning championships and doing amazing things.
We brought some gifts for you. We have two jerseysa number 46 and a number 49that we would love to have you a part of Dub Nation forever. [Laughter] And maybe find it maybe on the wall in the Oval Office or in your office. [Laughter] That would bewe'll come backhopefully, we'll be able to come back and check and see if it's up there. But[laughter].
I want to say, again, thank you for letting us be here to celebrate. And for our families, our staff, everybody here on the stage, it means the world. And hopefully, this isn't the last time.
So thank you.

2023-01-17 00:00:00,Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Prime Minister Mark Rutte of the Netherlands,"
President Biden. Well, Mr. Prime Minister, it's great to see you again. We've been in many, many meetings together, but it's good to have you here in the Oval Office.
And you're welcome despitedespitethe World Cup match.
Prime Minister Rutte. Yes, sorry. [Laughter]
President Biden. And in spite of that, you know, you're one of our strongest allies and personal friends, and you've been a great, great personal ally as well. And together, we're stepping up our protection for democratic values across the world. And we'reyou know, including standing strong with Ukraine.
Prime Minister Rutte. Yes.
President Biden. And you've been very, very stalwart. And we look to you as well to make sure we have a coherent European responseall Europein response to Ukraine.
And Russia is just continuing to act in ways that are almost unbelievable, the brutality with which they're acting.
Together, we're promoting human rights and the rule of law, and we're going to be cohosting the next summit on thethe Summit of Democracies in March, which we'll be together again. And there's a lot that we have to work on together.
And together, we're working on how to keep a free and open Indo-Pacific and, quite frankly, meet the challenges of China. Simply put, our companiesour countries have been, so far, in just lockstep in what we've done and our vision for the future.
And so today I look forward to discussing how we can further deepen our relationship and securing our supply chains to strengthen our transatlantic partnership.
And thank you again, Mr. Minister. We've had a great relationship with both our countries and personally. And I look forward to discussing a lot more in detail.
Prime Minister Rutte. Thank you. Thank you so much. And also, thank you for hosting me. It's the first time in my
President Biden. The fire.
Prime Minister Rutte. five visits that the fireplace
President Biden. That's right. The fireplace.
Prime Minister Rutte. is on.
And typically, I would start with the economy. And then I would have told the press that we are the second biggest investor in the U.S. and the United States is the biggest investor in Europe.
But I think we should talk Ukraine. And we have seen this terrible footage coming out of Dnipro this weekend, where innocent children, men, and women again were under rocket fire, and this apartment building was hit, and many people died. These are horrible pictures. And I think itit strengthens even more our resolve to stay with Ukraine.
And I want to commend you personally and the United States for your leadership. I'm convinced that history will judge that in 2022, if the United States would not have stepped up like you did, that things would have been very different at the moment in thisin the fight between Ukraine and Russian aggression.
And we have decided to spend another 2 billion on
President Biden. Yes.
Prime Minister Rutte. helping the Ukraine war effort. If you compare this to the size of America, it would be over $50 billion$50 billion.
We have the intention to join what you are doing with Germany on the Patriots project, so the air defense system. I think that is important that we join that. I discussed it also, this morning, with Olaf Scholz of Germany.
And then, on accountability, we can never accept that Putin and Russia get away with this. So, accountability to take them to court to make sure that this all gets done inalso in a legal way is crucial. And I know that you and I are working on this.
But again, your leadershipUnited States, you personallyhas been crucial. So, again, I want to thank you for that. And let's stay closely together this year. And hopefully, things will moveyesforward in a way which is acceptable for Ukraine. They have done so much. And this year will be important.
So, again, thank you.
President Biden. They have. And one of the thingsif I could just add very quickly: Europe continues to step up, respond to Russian actions. There's more to do, and we have to stay together. And it's been really, really, really important that you've been there every single step of the way. So thank you.
Thank you.

Revmake sure this is on. Is this on? Hello, hello, hello. Hellono ho, okay. [Laughter] Rev, thank you for very much for that introduction. And quite frankly, thank you for your partnership. You've been a good friend for a long time. It's an honor to spend the King holiday with the National Action Network and with the King familyMartin and the family.
And I understand, you know, there'sMartin III, we celebrate the legacy of your beloved mother and father. They worked for the ""Beloved Community."" But congratulations today to the honorees, including your wife, who I understand has a birthday today. [Laughter]
Well, look, my wife has a rule in our family. When it's somebody's birthday, you sing ""Happy Birthday.""
Are you ready?
[At this point, the President led members of the audience in singing ""Happy Birthday"".]
Well, it's hell turning 30, but you've got to put up with it. [Laughter]
And Nancy Pelosi, who I think is literally, not figuratively, the greatest leaderHouse Speaker in American history. And Minyon Moore, a mover and a shaker in politics. And Ray Curry, a true champion for the dignity of workers. And everyone here, from the civil rights community and Congress, it's wonderful to be with you on this special day.
Yesterday morning on what would've been Dr. King's 94th birthday, I attended the Sunday services at Ebenezer. And Iit was deeply meaningful and moving for me. It was because we face another inflection point in our Nation's history, one that's going to determine what this country looks like several decades from now.
You know, this is a time for choosing. Will we choose democracy over autocracy or community over chaos? Love over hate?
These are the questions of our time that I ran for President to try to help answer and that Dr. King's life and legacy, in my view, show us the way forward. We just have to look back. We've got to be prepared.
With all of you here, together we've made some important progress. Two years ago, our economy was on its backflat on its back. People were hurting, particularly in minority communities. Black Americans and other people of color were disproportionately hit.
And Kamala and I, and our administration, acted decisively, with the help of people in this room, to not only rescue the economy from the pandemic downturn, but to lay the foundation for a stronger and more resilient and more equitable economy for decades to come.
If you'll hold just a second, one of the things that I wanted toit's a slight digression. But one of the big issues was with the pandemic. I wanted to make sure that we spent the time, effort, and had the mechanism to make sure that minority communities were not left behind, that they were not left in the lurch.
And the highest percentage of workers in minority communities were treated asI mean, it was a single effort we had. And I'm very proud of the folks who ran that show that we got it done. We got it done.
You know, I'm of the view and have been my whole careerwhich is only a couple of years, I know; I don't look that, but[laughter]but I'm tired of trickle-down economics. You and I have never liked it, have we?
And I think the economythe way it should grow in America is from the bottom up and the middle out. That way, poor folks have a shot, middle class people do well, and the wealthy still do very well. They still do very well, but they start to pay their fair share.
And 2 years in, it's clearer than ever that I think our economic plan is working. We've created nearly 11 million jobs, the strongest job growth on record for any President at this point in history. The unemployment rate is the lowest it's been in 50 years. And Black unemployment is near record lows. Wages for Black workers are up. The two strongest years ever for small-business creation, including Black small businesses.
Across the board, American families have a bit more breathing room. More Black Americans have health insurance than ever in American history.
And as of the first ofthis first of January, our legislation is kicking in from last year. Insulin now is capped at $35 a month for seniors on Medicareinstead of payinginstead of paying up to hundreds of dollars a month.
And Big PharmaBig Pharmaunder the law we finally got passed with not much help from the other team, Big Pharma is in a situation where if they riseif they raise the drug price beyond the rate of inflation, they're going to pay stiff penalties for doing so. That's a fact.
And so we're trying to bring things under control. We're seeing the same progress on energyon energy costs. Folks can get tax credits when they install energy-efficient appliances in their home, like an energy-efficient dishwasher or heat pumps, or electric vehicles, if you're able to buy one of those.
We're investing in those fence-line communities that have suffered most consequences and have been smothered by pollution, like ""Cancer Alley"" in Louisiana or, in my home State, Route 9 in Delaware where thewhere all the mills arewhere the oil refineries are.
And we're making sure that these communities benefit from the biggest investment ever, ever, ever, with cleaner and safer environment. And the jobs that are going to go to clean up the environment are going to go to the folks in that communitygood-paying jobs. They're the ones that are going to get the jobs.
And so, folks, these are all pieces of a big, new law that we passed, and now they're kicking in. Americans can start to feel the benefits of these laws in their everyday lives. But that's not all.
We're implementing a once-in-a-generation infrastructure law with equity at its centerI mean that sincerelywith equity at its center. My Justice40 Initiative means 40 percent of all of the benefits in this infrastructure law, which over a trillion two hundred billion dollars over the next 10 years, those benefits of certain Federal investments flow directly to disadvantaged and underserved communities.
For example, 70 percent of the new infrastructure investments for shifting to electric schoolbuses, for example, so far have gone to disadvantaged communities where kids aren't breathing that polluted air from diesel buses. Seventy percent so far has gone to minority communities. And a lot more is coming.
We're modernizing American roads, bridges, ports, airports across the country. And we're beginning to replace every poisonous lead pipe in America. Every single one. We've already started, so every child in Americaso every American can turn on a faucet at home or at school and drink clean water.
A significant number of minority communities can't access affordable high-speed internet, as you all know and you've told me for years. But we're going to make sure that every community has access to affordable high-speed internet so no parent has to drive to a McDonald's parking lot to have their kid sign in for a connection to be able to do their homework.
And by the way, it's going to create millions of jobs in the meantime.
Folks, look, speaking of education, instead of photo opsand I know I spend a lot of timesome here from Delaware know I'm a big Delaware State guy. I went to the University of Delaware, but my political foundation is Delaware State College, HBCU.
I said I was going to help HBCUs that haven't been getting the help they need. You know, the folks at HBCUs are as competent as anybody else. But guess what? They don't have the laboratories. They don't have the funding because they don't have the endowments to build the laboratories for these good, new paying jobs. And so I've alreadywe've delivered nearly $6 billion in funding to HBCUs to invest in the next generation of Black leaders. That's a record, and that's a fact, and it's not going to stop.
To helplook, to help close the wealth gap, the racial wealth gap, under Secretary Fudgeshe is leading the effortwe're expanding efforts to build Black generational wealth, like every other person who has built their wealth. How did they build it? Homes. They invest in the equity in their homes. That's how it got built.
You know, if you build ain the last 25 years, if you build a housing development on one side of an interstate highway and you built the same one on the opposite side, and one is predominantly Black and the other is predominantly Whiteguess what?the value of the exact same home, built by the exact same builder is more valuable on the White side of that highway than on the Black side. That's a fact.
So we're going to aggressivelyaggressivelycombat racial discrimination in housing, including working to restore the rule that says, if a community gets Federal housing aid, it's not enough to just say it won't discriminate. It has to be meaningful, affirmative steps to overcome patterns of segregation and give everybody a fair shot that lives there. The same thing.
And by the way, if you live in one of those neighborhoods and you have the same exact car I have in the other neighborhood, you pay more for your insurance on that side. No basis for it, none at all, other than you're Black and I'm White.
We're also working with leaders to strengthen programs to redress the negative impacts of redlining. One of the things that I wasas a young county councilman, that's what almost lost me an election, but I'm very proud of ittrying to take care of redlining and get rid of discrimination.
We're launching a $1 billion pilot project funded by my bipartisan infrastructure law that Nancy made sure we got passedNance, thank youto help reconnect communities where highways have physically broken them up and locked out predominantly Black communities from opportunities, economic growth.
In the city of Wilmington, Delaware, where I'm fromwell, guess what?I-95 goes up through what used to be a predominantly Black neighborhood. Well, now you've got seven, eight, nine lanes counting exits and on-ramps and off-ramps that divide the community. It's lost its coherence.
Well, there's remediation money in the infrastructure bill to be able to pave over that, to haveso that if it's a tunnel, and instead you put park land in there, put recreation facilities in there, community centers in there.
And finally, we're addressing the cruel fact that Black families' homes often appraise, as I said, at a much lower value than the homes ownedthe same home owned by White families.
Black small businesses are the engines and the economic glue of any community, I need not tell anybody in this room. Restaurants, law firms, barbershops, beauty shopsthese are the folks that hold the community together. They're the ones that sponsor the Little League. They're the ones that sponsor the church events. They're the ones that sponsor the local volunteer fire company. They're the ones that sponsor everything. They keep a community going.
Well, to hold that community together, we need to encourage more of that. So I'm proud I signed into law that permanently authorizes the Minority Small Business Development Agency for the first time in our history. And it gives it[applause]. It gives expanded authority to help even more Black-owned businesses grow.
My administration also oversees hundreds of billions of dollars in Federal contracts, from everything from refurbishing a deck of an aircraft carrier to installing rails and handrails in a Federal building.
Well, I determined a long time ago, when I first got in, thatyou know, there's a law that was passed in the late thirties1930sthat says that if you, in fact, are going to spend taxpayers' dollars, and the President has to authorize where that's spent, it should be spent by Americanon American-made products by American businesses.
Well, guess what? We're doing it. And an awful lot of people are going to work. An awful lot of people are going to workand, folks, in thatin thatwhen I assigned thosewhen we awarded those contracts, I made a commitment, increasing from what is now roughly 10 percent of those contracts going into minority businesses to 15 percentto 15 percent by 2025.
And the share of those dollars are going to go to small businesses and disadvantaged businesses, including Black- and Brown-owned businesses. That's going to mean an additional $100 billion going into the creation of these small businesses$100 billion.
And we're doing all this while being fiscally responsible. We're making sure the wealthiest and biggest corporations finally start paying their fair share. Far from it, so far.
You know, if you'll hold a second, we're herewe're talking aboutand you've heard me say it, and I apologize for repeating it: There are over 55 companies in the Fortune 500500 companies that made $40 billion in 2022or 2021. Do you know how much they paid in taxes? Zero. Not one single penny.
But if you're a local cop, you're a local firefighter, you're a local nurse, you're going to pay 24 to 26 percent. And they're paying zero.
Well, we increased the corporate minimum taxI want to go back at itincreased the minimum tax to 15 percent. Now, that's not a whole lot for many of these major corporations. But no one earningby the way, no one earning less than $400,000 a year pays a single penny more in taxes. But 15 percent seems to me to be a bare minimum when corporates makea corporation making tens of billions of dollars should be paying.
Now, we're making this progress. At the same time, reduce the deficit. You know the talkthey're going to talk about ""big-spendin' Democrats"" again? [Laughter] Guess what? I reduced the deficit, last year, $350 billion. And this year, the Federal deficit is down one trillion-plus dollars. Hear me. That's a fact. And there's going to be hundreds of billions reduced over the next decade.
But so what? These guys are the fiscally[laughter]they're fiscally demented, I think. They don't[laughter]they don't quite get it.
To deliver equal justice under the law, we're building a Federal bench with judges that reflect all of America. Your dad talked about givingbasically, ""Give me judges, and we'll straighten things out."" Fair judges.
Well, guess what? You've probably heard of a lady called Ketanji Brown Jackson. I made a commitment to you, Al. I said, ""I'm going to appoint the first Black woman to the Supreme Court."" And she's about the smartest one of all of them, I might add. [Laughter]
And, by the way, we have appointed more Black women to the Federal Circuit Courts than every other President in American history combined. Every single President combined. And by the way, if you see Dick DurbinSenator Durbin, from Illinoisthank him. Thank him, because he got them through.
And there's so many of you who worked so hard to pass the George Floyd [Justice; White House correction] in Policing Act. But since the Senate Republicans blocked it last year, I did whatthe only thing I could do. I signed a historic Executive order that included key elements of that bill for the Federalat the Federal level.
It bans chokeholds and greatly restricts no-knock warrants. It creates a national database for officer misconduct that must be placed in the national database; to tighten the use of force policies to emphasize deescalation. We have to retrain cops as to why shouldn't you always shoot with deadly force. The fact is, if you need to use your weapon, you don't have to do that.
And look, to call a fresh approach to recruitin how we recruit, how we hire, how we train, how we promote, and how we retainretainlaw enforcement that come from the neighborhoods that they serve and know the people they're charged to protect.
Now, I know a lot of people say community police is not a good idea. Come to Wilmington, Delaware, with me with the old neighborhood I used to work in on the East Side called ""the Bucket."" They need protection. They're asking for protection, an overwhelmingly Black community. But they want cops who are fair. They want cops who know their communities. They want cops who are going to be doing it by the numbers.
And, folks, that's tied to more community policing and advancing public trust and safety.
Now, that's also why about a month after Buffalo and Uvaldeand I visited bothI signed the first major gun safety legislation in nearly 30 years. And I'll say what I said then, and I'll say it over and over again: I am going to get assault weapons banned. I did it once, and I'm going to do it again.
There's no social redeeming value. Deer aren't wearing Kevlar vests out there. What the hell do you need an assaultno, I'm serious. And ban the number of bullets that go in a magazine. There's no need for any of that.
I love my right-wing friends who talk about ""the tree of liberty is watered with the blood of patriots."" Give me aif you need to worry about taking on the Federal Government, you need some F-15s. You don't need an AR-15. I'm serious. Think about it. Think about the rationale for this. It's about moneymoney, money, money.
Meanwhile, we're making historic investments in community violence interventions. Studies have shown they reduce violent crime up to 60 percent. We've seen this kind of impact in Baltimore and Sacramento.
And by the way, even if I didn't want to do this, I'd be in real trouble. My daughter is a social worker, and this is what she does. And so, if I didn't, I'd be in real trouble with my Ashley. You've got an Ashley; we've got an Ashley. You think I'm joking. I'm not joking.
And one other thing about equal justiceI'm keeping my promise. No oneI'll say it again: No one should be in Federal prison for the mere possession of marijuana. No one. In addition to that, they should be released from prison and completely pardoned and their entire record expundedexpungentexpunged[laughter]so that if they have to ask, ""Have you ever been . . ."" you can honestly say, ""No.""
Folks, I just signed legislation to empower the FCC to cap the cost of phone calls from prison. Prison. Prisoners [prisons; White House correction] charge incarcerated people. It's a step just to allow them for some dignity. A lot of Federal prisoners are put in prisons, and they shouldn't be, far from where they live. They should be able to communicate with their families, with their children.
And we brought the Brittneyand we brought Brittney Griner home just in time for Christmas. And we have more to bring home as well.
Last year, I also held a first-of-its-kind White House summit against hate-fueled violence that many of you called for and supported. And, Rev, thank you for that as well.
Together, we're saying out loud, and we're saying it clearly that, in America, hate will not prevail. As my dad used to say, but it is not original to him, he'd say, ""Joey, silence is complicity."" Silence is complicity. We cannot remain silent, even if all we're doing is pointing it out and putting pressure on it to change. Silence is complicity.
For example, with your help, I signed a law, a hundred years in the making, to finally making lynching a Federal hate crimeto silence, as your dad said, ""the crying voice of little Emmett Till, screaming from the rushes of the Mississippi.""
Folks, it takes too long. And you've just shown me at the bill signing for other victoriesto enshrine marriage equality into the law; to make Juneteenth the first new Federal holiday since the establishment of Dr. King's holiday.
The ideaif we can hold a second herethe idea that we're supposed to remain silent on the abuses of the past, as if they didn't occur, that's not being ""woke,"" that's being honest. That's talking about history.
Well, folks, but we have a lot of unfinished work to do though. A lot of unfinished work. We have to keep building on it and defend our progress, because this new Congressthis new Congress
[The President sighed.]
[Laughter] Look, I know I get criticized from some of you and some folks in our party, my party, but I'm ready to work with a new Republican House on any Republicanor any Republican Congress to make progress for the people of America.
But like many Americans, I was disappointed to see the very first bill that the House ofHouse Republicansand, Nancy, you probably were rolling over when you saw itare bringing to the floor that would help the wealthy people and big corporations cheat on their taxes at the expense of ordinary, middle class taxpayers.
You know, all these new IRS agents we have is because they fired a lot of them, and a lot are retiring. And guess what? Who needs serious agents to know what they're doing or not doingthe billionaires, the multi-multimillionaires?
And according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, this one bill alone will add $114 billion to the deficit. This is their first bill. And they campaigned on inflation? They didn't say, if elected, their plan was to make inflation worse.
Plus, House Republicans introduced another bill on the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, blocking action that would help lower gasoline prices and help consumers.
They're preparing to vote on a third bill. They want a national sales tax. Let me say this againI know if I said that, it sounds like, ""What's Biden making up here?"" They want to raise taxes on the middle class by taxing thousands of everyday items from groceries, gasoline, clothing, cutting taxes for the wealthiest, because they want to supplant the money lost from taxes on the millionaires and billionaires with a sales tax on virtually everything in the country. What in God's name is that all about, other than what is obvious?
They want working class folks to be paying another 10, 20 percent on their taxes, depending on where they live and how they're spending the money. And they're going toand reduce taxes for the superwealthy.
Now, if we didn't see it, I'd think they're making this stuff up. If I told you in 2023 that the party was going to run on a national sales taxwell, that's how they're starting their new term, cutting taxes for billionaires.
And by the way, the number billionaires went up during the recession. Up. They didn't go down; they went up. Raising taxes on working families, making inflation workworse.
Let me be clear: If any of these bills happen to reach my desk, I will veto them. Any of them.
What I was saying during this last election cycle, this off-year election, this next thingeverybody said, ""They've got to be making this up, Biden."" Well, they're going to try to continue to try to cut Social Security or Medicare, which Americans have been paying into it with every single paycheck they've earned since they firstgot their first job when they were 16 years old.
But if Republicans want to work together on real solutionsthat's what theythey want tothey're going to argue that the thing is that for them to be sustained, you're going to have to change the way in which it works. Instead of putting more money in to guarantee Social Security, they're going to, kind of, cut Social Security, cut Medicare.
Look, if they want to work together on real solutions to lower inflation, create jobs, and build an economy that works for everybody, I'm ready.
One more thing: I don't want to hear a word from the other side about my student debt relief plan. Let me tell you why I say that.
It's going to help tens of millions of folks. Folks on Pell grants were hit financially because of the pandemic. Seventy percent of Black college students receive Pell grants. For many Black students, the saving will be significant in my debt relief plan, including wiping out their student debt completely. That's a real game-changer. And by the way, it will increase economic growth, not diminish it.
But the other side is dead set against it. These are the same folks who didn't have any problem at allany problem at allduring the pandemic, to vote for and make sure they get the so-called pandemic relief loans. We all supported it.
But guess what? A lot of these folks in the Congress, on the Republican side, were beneficiaries of these debt relief loans to the tunes of tens of millions of dollars. Not individually. I think the highest individual one was a million two hundred or something. I didn't hear a word. I did not hear a word from them about, ""They shouldn't be getting that relief.""
We didn't limit how much. We said, ""If you had a loss and it was legitimate to business, then you get to wipe it away."" And they're complaining about some kid being able to take away $20,000 in student debt that keeps him and his wife, or his husband or her husband, from being able to buy a home or start a business or just get going?
Well, these same folks who are going after us, they're the ones who voted for the tax benefits of the wealthiest and biggest corporations that weren't paid for. The Trump tax cut was well over, almost $2 trillion. Not a penny of it was paid for. So give me a break. Give me a break.
Currently, the only thing blocking my plan is them suing us. My administration is making the case to the Supreme Court, and I'm confidentI'm confidentin the legal authority to carry out our plan.
You know me. I said, ""If you had my back,"" and I said, ""I'd have yours."" On this one and so much more, I have your back. But we've got to stand together. We've got to stand together, including protecting a woman's right to choose.
We have to continue to fight for racial justice.
We've got to cut Black child poverty. We cut it in half in 2021 because of the child tax credit. We should bepermanently cut it. Now, I need your help to make it permanent.
And I was pleased to see Democrats and Republicans work together to pass the Electoral Count Reform Act to protect the will of the peopleNancy, thank you for getting that doneand a peaceful transfer of power. But we have to get the votes in Congress for the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act.
That's why I went to Atlanta a year ago, to make clear Iwe cannot let the filibuster be an obstacle in protecting the sacred right to voteperiodif we get there.
Let me close with this. Many of you have been working on these issues for a long time. Over the past 2 years, we've gotten an awful lot done together. We've got a lot done together. So let's keep it going. We've got the most vibrant economy in the world right nowin the world. We're doing better than any other major nation in the world today.
And that's what I thought about yesterday at Ebenezer, in that inflection point in history we're at. The path is clear: To go forward, we need to go together. So let's be guided by Dr. King's light and by the charge of Scripture, which is: ""Let us never grow weary in doing what is right, for if we do not give up, we will reap our harvest in due time.""
Well, we're going to reap the harvest. Let's remember who we are: We're the United States of America. And there's nothing beyond our capacitynothing, nothing, nothingif we do it together.
So God bless you all. God bless the King family. And, ladies and gentlemen, may God protect our troops.
Thank you so very much.

2023-01-15 00:00:00,"Remarks Honoring Martin Luther King, Jr., in Atlanta, Georgia","
The President. Can you all hear me? Oh! I've spoken before parliaments, kings, queens, leaders of the world. I've been doing this for a long time, but this is intimidating following. [Laughter] You all are incredible.
Iand let's lay one thing to rest. I may be a practicing Catholicwe used to go to 7:30 mass every morning, in high school and going into college, before I went to the Black church. [Laughter] Not a joke. Andy knows this.
Andy, it's so great to see you, man. You're one of the greatest we've ever had. You really are, Andy. Andy and I took on apartheid in South Africa and a whole lot else. They didn't want to see him coming. [Laughter]
But we used tothat's where we'd organize to march to desegregate the city. My State was, like yours, segregated by law. We were a slave State, to our great shame. And we had a lot of leftovers of the bad things that come from that period of time. But Iat any rate, that's another time. [Laughter] But I learned a lot.
And I promise, if any preacher preached to me back then, I'm not going to be nearly as long as you were. [Laughter] Actually, I have a bad reputation for speaking too long.
He followed the path of Moses, a leader of inspiration, calling on the people not to be afraid and to always, always, as my grandfather would say, ""keep the faith."" He followed the path of Joseph. A believer in dreams, in the divinity they carry, in the promise they hold. And like John the Baptist, he prepared us for the greater hope ahead, one who came to bear witness to the light.
Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., was a nonviolent warrior for justice who followed the word and the way of His Lord and His Savior. On this day of remembrance, we gather at Dr. King's cherished Ebenezer. I sayI emphasize the word ""cherished"" Ebenezer. And by the way, Sis: Every good man, every good brother needs a really strong, strong sister. You think I'm kidding. I'm no Dr. King, and my sister is not you, but I'll tell you what: She's smarter, better looking, and a better person than I am. [Laughter] Managed all my campaigns.
Folks, you know, on this day of remembrance, as we gather here at this cherished Ebenezer to commemorate what would have been Dr. King's 94th birthday, we gather to contemplate his moral vision and to commit ourselves to his pathto his path. The path that leads to the ""Beloved Community,"" to the sacred place and that sacred hour when justice rains down like waters and righteousness was a mighty stream.
Folks, to the King family, I know no matter how many years passit doesn't matter how many years passthose days of remembrance are difficult. They bring everything back as if it happened yesterday. It's hard for you.
And I want to thank the King familypresumptuous of me to do this, but, on behalf of the whole congregationfor being willing to do this year in and year out, because you give so muchso muchto the rest of us. And we love you all. We love you all.
To fully honor Dr. King, we have to pay tribute to Mrs. Coretta Scott King, who we dearly miss. She led the movement that created the King holiday and so much more. In my view, this day is her day as well.
And to Raphael Warnockreverend, doctor, Senatorcongratulations on your historic victory. A fellow Morehouse man. I've come to know a lot of Morehouse men. [Laughter] That old saying, ""You can't tell them much."" [Laughter] But I tell you what, we've set up, for the first time ever at the White House, a Divine Nine committee. It's active every day. And I watch how the other graduates pick on the Morehouse men.
You stand in Dr. King's pulpit, and you carry on his purpose. And this service doesn't stop at the church door. It didn't with Dr. King, it doesn't with you, and it doesn't with the vast majority of you standingsitting before me.
I want to thank you for the honor of inviting me to be call to America's""America's freedom church"".
And thank you to this congregation and to all the distinguished guests, elected and unelected officials that are here today who've done so much over so many years. And so many young people are going to do so much more than we were able to do.
What's your name honey?
[At this point, the President addressed a young girl in the congregation.]
Well, it's good to see you. Maybe I can have a picture with you when Ibefore I leave, okay? Is that all right?
Audience members. Aww.
The President. I say this with all sincerity: I stand here humbled being the first sitting President of the United States to have an opportunity to speak at Ebenezer Sunday service. You've been around for 136 years. I know I look like it, but I haven't. [Laughter]
I'm God-fearing thanks to my parents and to the nuns and priests who taught me in school, but I am no preacher. But I've tried to walk my faith, as all of you have.
I stand here inspired by the preacher who was one of my only political heroes. I've been sayingand Andy's heard me say it for yearsI have two political heroes my entire life when I started off as a 22-year-old kid in the East Side asin the civil rights movement, and got elected to the United States Senate when I was 29. I wasn't old enough to take office.
And I had two heroes: Bobby KennedyI admired John Kennedy, but I could never picture him at my kitchen table, but I could Bobbyand, no malarkey, Dr. King. Dr. King.
And the fact is that, you know, I stand here at a critical juncture for the United States and the world, in my view. We're at a what Isome of my colleagues are tired of hearing me sayingbut we're at what we call an ""inflection point,"" one of those points in world history where what happens in the last few years and will happen in the next 6 or 8 years, they're going to determine what the world looks like for the next 30 to 40 years.
It happened after World War II. It's happening again. The world is changing. There's much at stake. Much at stake. And you know, the fact is that this is the time of choosing. This is the time of choosing direct choices we have.
Are we a people who will choose democracy over autocracy? Couldn't ask that question 15 years ago. Everyone thought democracy was settled. Not for African Americans. But democracy, as an institutional structure, was settled. But it's not. It's not.
We have to choose a community over chaos. Are we the people who are going to choose love over hate? These are the vital questions of our time and the reason why I'm here as your President. I believe Dr. King's life and legacy show us the way we should pay attention. I really do.
Dr. Martin Luther King was born into a nation where segregation was a tragic fact of life. He had every reason to believe, as others of the generation did, that history had already been written, that the division would be America's destiny. But he rejected that outcome. He heard Micah's command to do justice, love mercy, and walk humbly.
And so, often, when people hear about Dr. King, people think of his ministry and the movement, or most about the epic struggle for civil rights and voting rights. But we do well to remember that his mission was something even deeper. It was spiritual. It was moral.
The goal of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which Dr. King led, stated it clearly and boldly, and it must be repeated again, now: to redeem the soul of America. I'm not joking. To redeem the soul of America.
What is the soul of America? Easy to say, but what is the soul of America? Well, the soul is the breath, the life, the essence of who we are. The soul makes us ""us.""
The soul of America is embodied in the sacred proposition that we're all created equal in the image of God. That was the sacred proposition for which Dr. King gave his life. It was a sacred proposition rooted in Scripture and enshrined in the Declaration of Independence. A sacred proposition he invoked on that day in 1963 when he told my generation about his dream, a dream in which we're all entitled to be treated withmy father's favorite worddignity and respect. A dream in which we all deserve liberty and justice. And it is still the task of our time to make that dream a reality, because it's not there yet.
To make Dr. King's vision tangible, to match the words of the preachers and the poets with our deeds, as the Bible teaches us, we must be doers of the Word. Doers of the Word. The battle for the soul of this Nation is perennial. It's a constant struggle. It's a constant struggle between hope and fear, kindness and cruelty, justice and injustice against those who traffic in racism, extremism, and insurrection; a battle fought on battlefields and bridges, from courthouses and ballot boxes, to pulpits and protests.
And at our best, the American promise wins out. At our best, we hear and heed the injunctions of the Lord and the whispers of the angels. But I don't need to tell you that we're not always at our best. We're fallible. We fail and fall. But faith and history teach us that, however dark the night, joy cometh in the morning.
And that joy comes with the commandments of Scripture: ""Love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, all thy mind, and all thy soul."" And ""Love thy neighbor as thy self."" Easy to say. Easy to say. But very hard to do.
But in that commandment, in my view, lies the essence of the gospel and the essence of the American promise. It's when we see each other as neighbors and not enemies that progress and justice come. It's when we see each other as fellow human beings and as children of God, that we bendbegin to walk the path of Dr. King's ""Beloved Community."" A path his dream inspired and whose legacy propel us forward to this day.
Here's what I learned in my life and in my career along that path, as many of you have learned along your path: We're all imperfect beings. We don't know where and what fate will deliver to us, and when. But we dowe can do our best to seek a life of light and hope and love and, yes, truth. Truth.
That's what I try to do every day to build the future that we all want, while reminding ourselves that nothingnothingis guaranteed in our democracy. Nothing. Every generation is required to keep it, defend it, protect it, to be repairers of the breach, and to remember that the power to redeem the soul of America lies where it always has lielay: in the hands of ""We the People."" ""We the People.""
I was vividly reminded of that truth on the South Lawn of the White House. I believe you were there, both of youboth your Senatorson the South Lawn of the White House with our Vice President, Kamala Harris, and hearing these words, and I quote: ""It took just one generation from segregation to the Supreme Court of the United States."" End of quote. Those are the words of KejanKetanji Jrown [Brown; White House correction] Jackson, our Supreme Court Justice.
It took just one generation, from segregation to the Supreme Court of the United States. And as I told folks at the time: She's smarter than you are.
As Dr. King said, ""Give us the ballot, and we will place judges on the bench . . . who will do justly."" And we are. That's the promise of America, where change is hard, but necessary.
[The President coughed.]
Excuse me.
Progress is never easy, but it's always possible. And things do get better on our march toward a more perfect Union.
But at this inflection point, we know there's a lot of work that has to continue on economic justice, civil rights, voting rights, on protecting our democracy, and on remembering that our job is to redeem the soul of America.
Look, I get accused of being an inveterate optimist. I call that the ""Irish of it."" [Laughter] We're never on top, always stepped on. But we are optimistic, like Dr. King was optimistic.
Folks, as I said, progress is never easy, but redeeming the soul of the country is absolutely essential. I doubt whether any of us would've thought, even in Dr. King's time, that theliterally, the institutional structures of this country might collapselike we're seeing in Brazil, we're seeing in other parts of the world.
Folks, I'll close with thiswith a blessing I see today. In the Oval Officeand many of you have been there, been there in my officeyou get to set it up the way you want, within reason. As I sit at my desk
Audience member. [Inaudible]Mr. President! [Laughter]
The President. As I sit at my desk and look at the fireplace, just to the left is the bust of Dr. King. It's there, in that spot, on purpose. Because he was my inspiration as a kid. He does know where we should go.
I ran for three reasons. I said I wanted to restore the soul of America. I wanted to rebuild this country from the bottom up and the middle out. And I wanted to unite it.
And not far from him, if you look about 40, 50 degrees to the right, there is another statue, another bustof Rosa Parks. People ask me, ""Why?"" I sayand I put in my wordsshe'd just say, ""I've had enough."" I've had enough.
Folks, I often think of the question that Dr. King asked us all those years ago. I think it's important. You all remember, but I think it's important the Nation remember it. He said, ""Where do we go from here?"" That's a quote. Where do we go from here?
Well, my message to the Nation on this day is: We go forward, we go togetherwhen we choose democracy over autocracy, a beloved community over chaos; when we choose believers and the dreams, to be doers, to be unafraid, always keeping the faith.
Every time I'd walk out of my Irish Catholic grandfather's home up in Scranton, Pennsylvaniahis name was Ambrose Finneganand he'd yell, ""Joey, keep the faith."" And my grandmother: ""No, Joey. Spread it. Spread the faith."" [Laughter] No, I'm serious. It's a Catholic Rosary I have on my wristthe one my son had on the daythe night he was dying.
The point is, there's hope. There's always hope. We have to believe. And, ladies and gentlemen, that was Dr. King's path, in my viewthe path of keeping the faithand it must be our path.
Folks, for God's sake, this is the United States of America. The United States. There's nothing beyond our capacitynothing beyond our capacityif we set our mind to it. And, ladies and gentlemen, we're a land of dreamers and a land of doers. Nothing is beyond our capacity.
And the gospel song that Dr. King loved, as I understand or they always told he did: ""We've come too far from where we started. Nobody told me that the road would be easy. I don't believe He brought me this far to leave me."" He did not bring me this far to leave me.
My fellow Americans, I don't think the Lord brought us this far to leave us. I really don't. My word. And, my fellow Americans, God bless Dr. Martin Luther King and his family. And based on hisone of his favorite hymns, ""Precious Lord, take my hand through the storm, through the night, [and] lead me on to the light.""
May God bless you all. And let's go find the light. We can do this. I mean it.

2023-01-13 00:00:00,Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Prime Minister Fumio Kishida of Japan,"
President Biden. Fumio, they like you. [Laughter]
Prime Minister Kishida. Thank you.
President Biden. Well, Mr. Prime Minister, it's great to see you again and welcometo be able to welcome such a close friend to the Oval Office again. And you know, we meet at a remarkable moment in our alliance. I can honestly saymore as a student of history than a participantthat it's beenI don't think there's ever been a time when we've been closer to Japan in the United States.
[At this point, the President addressed the interpreter.]
I'll stop so you can translate.
Last year in Japan, you said to me, and I quote, ""We are two nations that share fundamental values."" I couldn't agree with you more. We are.
These shared democratic values are the source of our strength, the source of our alliance, and the source of our being able to deliver for all our people.
We're modernizing our military alliance, building on Japan's historic increase in defense spending and new national security strategy.
Let me be crystal clear: The United States is fully, thoroughly, completely committed to the alliance and, more importantly, to Japan's defensethe defense of Japan.
We're working closely on tech and economic issues, including the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.
And we're stepping up to hold Putin accountable for his unprovoked war in Ukraine. And I want to thank youthank youfor your strong leadership on this from the very firstthe very firstconversation we had on this.
Today I'm looking forward to how we can continue advancing our shared goals and values, including at the G-7 summit in Japan and the APEC in San Francisco later this year.
Rather than figuring out how we can work more closely together, a more difficult job would be trying to figure out how and where we disagree.
You're a real leader, and you're a real friend.
Prime Minister Kishida. Well, Joe, thank you so much for those warm words of welcome.
As we enter the new year of 2023, I am pleased to make my first visit to Washington, DC, as Prime Minister and to have this meeting with you, Joe, my dear friend.
Last yearor starting with your visit to Japan in May, we were able to accomplish so much for our peace and security in the region and prosperity in the region and the international community through numerous meetings, not just our bilateral summit meetings, but also the Quad meetings, the Japan-U.S.-R.O.K. trilaterals, among others. And I'm sincerely grateful for your cooperation, Joe.
And Japan and the United States are currently facing the most challenging and complex security environment in recent history. And in order to ensure our peace and prosperity in the region and to contribute to that and also safeguard peace and security of Japan, in late last year, Japan formulated a new national security strategy.
And in so doing, theJapan decided to fundamentally reinforcing our defense capabilities, including in possessing the counterstrike capabilities, and in order to ensure that, increased our defense budget. And this new policy was set forth by Japan, and I believe that this will be beneficial for the deterrence capabilities and response capabilities of the alliance as well.
And, Joe, as you rightly pointed out, I too feel that the role to be played by Japan and the United Stateswhich share the fundamental values such as democracy and the rule of lawthe role that we are to play is becoming even greater.
And today I very much look forward to having a candid exchange of views with you, Joe, on the various important topics, including a free and open Indo-Pacific, the G-7, APEC, as well as climate change.
President Biden. I look forward to it as well. Thank you.

2023-01-12 00:00:00,Remarks at a Memorial Service for Former Secretary of Defense Ashton B. Carter,"
This is beyond my capacity to accurately assess what an incredible man Ash was. Ash was a force. He was a force of nature. His genius was evident, his integrity unfailing, and his commitment to service before self was literally inspiring.
I know we can all still picture Ash as he was until the very end.
Professor Carter: packing students into his classroom in Cambridge, guiding them forward toward a life of service.
Secretary Carter: advising both me and Secretary Austin on technology and innovation. Austin got it quicker than Biden, butDoctor Carter: harnessing his incredible intellect to sharpen our cutting edge as a Nation and to make suremake sure America always leads the world with both our power but also our purpose.
I wish so deeply that Ash had lived to enjoy the new honorificone he was looking forward toof being grandfather. But he's smiling right now, and he's looking down. And he'll be there.
Will, Avayou were his heart. He filled every officeat least I was ever inwith your photos. I kept asking, ""Who's that big guy?"" [Laughter] He loved seeing youhe loved seeing you blaze your own trails in the world, together with your wonderful spouses, Mariah and Surya.
And I think the reason he talked to me about it isyou know me, I never talk about my children. [Laughter]
But, Clayton, you and Ash parented two exceptional kids together. Corinne and Cynthia, you were with Ash from the very beginning. As I told you downstairs, I was lucky, as well. I had sisters better looking and smarter than me. And so did he. And he relied on you. Watching your little brotheryour little brother chart his phenomenal path from theoretical physics to the world of science, but the worldto a world leader.
And, Stephanie, everyone could see: He cherished you. He cherished you. You made him whole.
I have some ideaand every case is not the samebut how hard this is, how unreal and unfair it seems, to lose someone you love so suddenly, someone who should have had so many years ahead of them. The suddenness, in my view, magnifies the grief. It makes it just inescapable.
And on behalf of our Nation, I just want to say thank you. Thank you for sharing Ash with us and for your own service to our country. We're truly grateful.
Secretary Austin, Secretary Blinken, Secretary McDonough, Secretary Mayorkas, Director Haines, General Milley, General Dunford, Members of Congress, and all the distinguished leaders from across the Government, our military, and private sector and academia: Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, ""An institution is the lengthened shadow of one man."" An institution is the lengthened shadow of one man.
He might have been talking about Ash, but nowhere more than the Department of Defense. Over the course of four decades, working in and out of the Pentagon, walking miles and miles of laps, Ash made an impact felt far into the future.
Ash always took the hardest jobs, the seemingly impossible missions, because he believed he could make a difference. And he did make a difference.
I stand here today as Commander in Chief of, as Ash always said, the ""finest fighting force the world has ever known."" And that is not hyperbole. The finest fighting force the world has ever known. A force made stronger and more inclusive by Ash's principles and convictions. A force made up of warriors who are safer because of Ash's determination to protect them and give them what they needed. A force and a department forever shaped by Ash's far-reaching vision and his relentlessrelentlessinnovation.
He believed, as I do, in what America can achieve when we put our minds to it. He believed not just in getting things done, but getting things done in record time, which I'm sure those who worked for him found very interesting sometimes. I've got a lot of you[laughter]laughter on this side.
As many of you know well, he took personal pleasure in busting through bureaucratic redtape to deliver results. And woe unto the staffer who failed to follow through on an assignment that Ash had given them. Dean, as they say in my church, ""Bless me Father, for they have sinned.""
But I'm seriousI see some people nodding in recognitionhe was an incredible guy.
Ash was a scientist, first and always. A truth seeker, a teacher. That training shaped his leadership. And he sought to understand a problem from every angle. He took the time then to explain his thinking. And he never let politics or expediency color his recommendation. He always followed where the facts led him. And sometimes there were places we didn't want to go.
That's what made his counsel so valuable to President Obama and to me, as Vice President, and so many other leaders. Ash felt a duty to deliver his best possible analysis and recommendation with exceptional candor, with exceptional discretion, and above all, with exceptional integrity.
As I told Stephanie when I called her the morning after Ash passed, that's actually the first thing I think of when I think of Ash. I think of a wordno, seriously: integrity. His integrity. It was indomitable. And I never, ever had to wonderI've been doing this job a longnot as President, but in high public office. Never had to wonder whether there was an edge to it, whether there was a secondary motive I didn't see. How he matched his scientific principles with a straightforward moral conviction that truth, honesty, and decency matter.
And how Ash never lost sight of what his work at the Pentagon meant for the safety of the American peoplewhether he was serving with ahis mentor and great friend, Secretary of Defense Bill Perry, in the nineties to reduce the risks of nuclear proliferation after the Soviet Union collapsed, or when Ash became Secretary himself in 2015, taking the fight to ISIS to smash their hold on territories in Iraq and Syria and keep America safe from terrorist threats.
Above all, Ash had an unmistakable commitment to his troops, who put their lives on the line for our country every single day. Ash understood to his core that we had a sacredwe have a sacred obligation to give them what they need and support they need when we send them into harm's way.
As a nationyou've heard me say it, but I heard him say it in a similar waywe have many obligations, but only one truly sacred obligation: to properly prepare and equip those we send into harm's way and care for them and their families when they return home.
And there is no greater example of this than Ash's tendencies when it came to getting our troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan mine-resistant, ambush-protected vehiclesMRAPs.
Tony and others remember. We were working together. I became the pain in the neck for everybody by pushing this so hard, but I had a little guy with aa guy whispering in my ear. There weresome thought there were other priorities first, but not Ash.
In the early 2000s, 60 or 7060 to 70 percent of our troop casualties were from road IEDsimprovised explosive devicesthat would rip through theour Humvees, as well as our troops who were riding in them.
I led the fight on the Senate floor in 2007 to make sure we were forward-funding the production of these MRAPs. I believed, along with the Commandant of the Marine Corps at the time, that we had, and I quote, a ""moral imperative"" to speed up their delivery to get our troops this critical equipment that would literally saveand literally did savecountless American lives and limbs.
But by the time the O-Bidenthe Obama-Biden administration took office in 2009, the production and delivery of MRAPs to the field was still going too slowly. All that changed when Ash became the ""acquisitions czar."" It all changed. He made his mission to ""work at war speed"" to get our warfighters the best possible protection we could give them as fast as possible.
And he was personally engaged, refining and improving the design of the to make them safer and easier to maneuverwhenmaneuver. When Ash learned that the troops in the field were having an issue with visibility, he was at the R&D facility the very next day. He was there to see the problem for himself, ride the vehiclein the vehicle, and get it done.
In 2012, Ash had been promoted to Deputy Secretary. By that time, we had deployed more than 24,000 MRAPs. Casualty rates among troops transported by MRAPs came down by as much as 75 percent compared to those riding in Humvees. Ash got it done.
And as I told the family when I met them beforehand, I have aprobably, I don't know, 3, 4-foot-long by 10 inches high, maybe a foot high, photograph of MRAPs lined up side by side with a note from Ash saying: ""Thanks. Ash Carter."" I have it hanging in my office at homein my home.
You know, it's amazing what he did with his background as a scientist. I justhe got it done. And he literally saved, I think, in consequence of it, hundreds and hundreds, thousands of lives and limbs. He protected our servicemembers' futures because they were out defending ours.
How many Americans are alive today welcoming children of their own because of Ash Carter. How many of them who came home bearing the scars of war have memories of Ash at their bedsideStephanie right there with himas they recovered at Walter Reed and other places around the world?
All those quiet visits to Walter Reedwithout the press, without any fanfare, standing long before he became Secretary. Holding the hands of wounded warriors. Hugging the family members and keeping them close. Listening to their stories, which they want to tell and we should listen to. And finding something to smile about together, despite their pain.
Ash's connection to our troops and their families was more than a professional duty. To him, it was personal.
And to Stephanie: You were fundamental to that. You helped Ash to bring his fullest self to his service. He could not have been the Secretary of Defense that he was, the mentor he was, the man he was, without your love and support. It meant so much to so many.
Remember Emerson: ""An institution is the lengthened shadow of one man."" And it was a long shadow.
Or as Ash sometimes told his students, ""You are my legacy now."" You are my legacy now. And how many of them are.
Each of us here todaygenerations of national security leaders, decades of eager and brilliant students, the entire Armed Forces of the United States of Americawe all will forever bear the imprint of Ash Carter, thank God.
May we continue to carry the legacy of Ash with us in our hearts. May we be guided by his foresight, his ferocious mind, fortified by his integrity. And may we always seek the truth. May we always strive to be of service.
May God bless Ash Carter, a dear friend, a great American. And may God continue to protect our troops, who Ash so loved and loved him back.

2023-01-12 00:00:00,Remarks on Efforts To Combat Inflation and an Exchange With Reporters,"
The President. Good morning. Sorry I'm a little late. And I'm due at theplease, have a seatthe National Cathedral at a little after 11.
But good morning. Today we've got some good news, good news about the economy. For the sixth month in a row, inflation has come down. Measured over the last 12 months, it has fallen 6.5to 6.5 percent. That's down from 7.1 percent the month before. And it's down from 9.1 percent this summer. Inflation is now at its lowest level since October of 2021.
When we look at thejust the last 3 months, we see that inflation fell to 1.8 percent on an annualized basis. It's down from more than 11 percent in the first 3 months of last year.
So the data is clear: Even though inflation is high in major economies around the world, it is coming down in America month after month, giving families some real breathing room. And the big reason is falling gas prices.
My administration took action to get oil onto the market and bring down prices. Now gas is down more than $1.70 from its peak. And that adds up to a family witha typical family with two vehicles to a savings of $180 a month, every single month, that stays in their pockets instead of being spent at the pump.
Food inflation is slowing as well. Last month, we saw the smallest increase in food prices in almost 2 years. And much of that increase was due to the avian flu outbreak, which has driven up the egg prices aroundin the United States.
It's not just gas and food prices though. When we look at what economists call ""core inflation,"" which takes out energy and food, we see welcome news as well. Core inflation is down to the lowest level in a year. Over the past 3 months, core inflation has come down to 3 percent on an annualized basis. That's down from more than 6 percent at the beginning of 2022. The cost of goods is actually falling as prices for everything from computers to used cars are coming down as well. And inflation in the core services is moderating as well.
You know, and as inflation is coming down, take-home pay for workers is going up. Workers' wages are higher now than they were 7 months ago, adjusted for inflation. Wages for lower-income and middle-income workers have gone up even more.
It all adds up to a real break for consumers, real breathing room for families, and more proof that my economic plan is working.
When I came into office almost 2 years ago, the economy was flat on its back, as you'll all remember. Millions of people had lost their jobs through no fault of their own. Millionsmillionswho kept their jobs saw the hours and paychecks cut. Hundreds of thousands of small businesses permanently closed their doors.
People were hurting badly. That's what we inherited. The pandemic was raging, and the economy was reeling. We acted decisively to put in place a new strategy that would build a rescuewould rescue the economy from the pandemic downturn. At the same time, we laid the foundation for a stronger, more resilient economy for decades to come, an economy that grows from the bottom up and the middle out.
Now, 2 years in, it's clearclearer than ever that my economic plan is actually working. Here's what we've learned just last week. Unemployment is the lowest it's been in 50 years. I'll say that again: the lowest unemployment rate in a half a century.
My first 2 years in office were the 2 strongest years for job growth on record. We created nearly 11 million jobs, including 750,000 manufacturing jobs. And they were the 2 of the strongest years ever for small-business creation as well.
And today, unemployment rate is near record lows for Blacks and HispanicBlack and Hispanic workers, near record lows. And it's the lowest ever on record for people with disabilities.
We're seeing American families breathing a little easier. More Americans have health insurance than they did ever in our history. Fewer families are facing foreclosures today than before the pandemic.
And we still have more work to do though, but we're clearly moving in the right direction. And there are morethere's more breathing room in store for American workers and families.
Starting last week, as of January 1, a month's supply of insulin is now capped at $35 for seniors on Medicare. Some were paying hundreds of dollars every month for their insulin, but not anymore. Starting last week, if Big Pharma raises prices faster than inflation, they're going to face big penalties.
Starting last week, Americans can get tax credits when they install energy-efficient appliances in their homes, like heat pumps or solar panels, or when they buy electric vehicles.
These were all pieces of whatthat big law that we passed last year. Now, they're kicking in and Americans are starting to feel the benefits in their everyday lives.
But that's not all. We're seeing historic investments in American manufacturing turn into new factories and new jobs from Arizona, Ohio, Georgia, New York.
Companies have announced nearly $300 billion in manufacturing investments here in the United States since I became President. Instead of exporting jobs, like we did for decades, we're now creating jobs and exporting product. Creating jobs and exporting product, that's the idea.
Now, the House has elected a new Speaker. I called to congratulate him, and I'm ready to work with him or any Republican in Congress to make progress on the Americanon thefor the American people.
But like many Americans, I was disappointed that the very first bill the Republicans in the House of Representatives passed would help wealthy people and big corporations cheat on their taxes at the expense of ordinary, middle class taxpayers. And it would add $114 billion to the deficit. Their very first bill.
House Republicans campaigned on inflation. They didn't say, if elected, their plan was to make inflation worse.
Plus, House Republicans introduced another bill: blocking action that would help lower gas prices and help consumers.
And on top of that, House Republicans are preparing to vote on a national sales tax bill. National sales tax, that's a great idea. It would raise taxes on the middle class by taxing thousands of everyday items from groceries to gas, while cutting taxes for the wealthiest Americans.
And if I'm not mistaken, what they've introducedit also would totally eliminate the IRS. It feels good, except all going to be sales tax. Go home and tell your moms. They're going to be really excited about that.
Come on. Is this how House Republicans are starting the new term: cutting taxes for billionaires, raising taxes for working families, and making inflation worse?
Well, let me be very clear: If any of these bills make it to my desk, I will veto them. I will flat veto them. I'm ready to work with Republicans, but not this kind of stuff.
If they try to cut Social Security or Medicare, which Americans have been paying into with every paycheck since they have ever have hadgot their first paycheck, I'll use my veto pen to stop that as well.
But if Republicans want to work together on real solutions to lower inflation, create more jobs, build an economy that works for everyone, I'm ready.
Let me close with this. Today's inflation numbers are good newsgood news about our economy. And we have more work to do, but we're on the right track.
We're seeing bright spots across the country where great things are happening. Roads and bridges are being built. Factories are coming on line. People back to work again. Families breathing a little bit easier.
That's why I can honestly sayand you're heard me say this before and I mean it from the bottom of my heartI've never been more optimistic about America's future than I am today.
We just have to remember who in God's name we are. You've heard me say it many times: This is the United States of America. There's nothingnothingbeyond our capacity if we work together.
So God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.
Q. Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. Presidentthank you, sir. Mr. President
[At this point, several reporters began asking questions at once.]
The President. Okay.
The President's Storage of Classified Documents From the Obama Administration 
Q. Mr. President, classifiedclassified material next to your Corvette? What were you thinking?
The President. Let methey'reI'm going to get a chance to speak on all this, God willing, soon, but as I said earlier this week, peopleand by the way, my Corvette is in a locked garage. Okay? So it's not like they're sitting out in the street. But at any rate
Q. So the material was in a locked garage?
The President. Yes, as well as my Corvette.
But as I said earlier this week, people know I take classified documents and classified material seriously. I also said we're cooperating fully and completely with the Justice Department's review.
As part of that process, my lawyers reviewed other places where documents might havefrom my time as Vice President were stored. And they finished the review last night.
They discovered a small number of documents of classified markings in storage areas in file cabinets in my home and myin my personal library. This was done in the case of the Biden Pennthis was done in the case of the Biden Penn Center.
The Department of Justice was immediatelyas was done, the Department of Justice was immediately notified, and the lawyers arranged for the Department of Justice to take possession of the document.
So you're going to seewe're going to see all this unfold. I'm confident
Q. When did you find there was a second batch of documents?
[Several reporters began speaking at once.]
The President. Thank you very much. Thank you.
Q. How's your wife?
The President. Hey, how you doing? Good to see you!
First Lady Jill T. Biden 
Q. How's your wife?
The President. She's good.
Q. How is the First Lady, sir? How is the First Lady?
The President. She's doing really well. She was under a long timefor 5 hoursbecause what they were doing is they take outthey do the Mohs, meaning remove what they thought what might be cancerousand they have to then go back and test it and see what it was. But she's doing really well.
She's up. We had awe had breakfast this morning. She's recovering. And she's going to be sore for a while because of the work they did on her eyes. Andbut underyou know, that's where one of thesethese were. But she has a0 to 1 percent chance of everthe return of any cancer.
And so, thank God, she's doing really well. Thank you for asking.

2023-01-10 00:00:00,"The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Justin P.J. Trudeau of Canada and President Andrs Manuel Lpez Obrador of Mexico in Mexico City, Mexico","
Moderator. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. And we welcome the President of the United Mexican States, Mr. Andrs Manuel Lpez Obrador. With him, His Excellency Joseph Biden, Jr., President of the United States of America, and His Excellency, Mr. Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada. And we also have their respective delegations, representatives of the media, and people following us through internet, through the social media. Let's welcome two Presidents and Prime Minister.
Joseph Biden, Jr., President of the United States of America, you have the floor, sir.
President Biden. Thank you very much. It's wonderful to be back here in Mexico City. And I want to thank you, Mr. President, for hosting the Prime Minister and me for the 10th North American Leaders' Summit. This is a magnificent fora.
And we're true partners, the three of us, working together with mutual respect and a genuine like for one another to advance a safer and more prosperous future for all of our people. And the reason for this summit and this trilateral relationship are so impactful is because we share a common vision for the future, grounded on common valuesand I mean that sincerelycommon values we share in our countries.
Since becoming President, I've been laser-focused on rebuilding the U.S. economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not the trickle-down economy. Because the bottom up and the middle out, it works, because the wealthy do very well and everybody else does well too, but everybody does well. And ""from the bottom up"" ismeans investing in priorities for working families.
And the United States has made historic, bipartisan investments in infrastructure and innovation that are already beginning to deliver concrete benefits for the American people, and, I would argue, it will ultimately reap benefits for the entire North America. We've renewed our dependenceour deepand deepened our cooperation forof the closest friends and allies, none closer than Mexico and Canada, to take on the biggest challenges facing the region and, quite frankly, the world.
Because there can no longer be any questionnonein today's interconnected world. We cannot wall ourself off from shared problems. We are stronger and better when we work together, the three of us. And together, we've made enormous progress since our last summit, from COVIDfighting COVID-19 and strengthening our ability to address public health threats, to investing in and building a 21st-century workforce.
At the top of our shared agenda today is keeping theNorth America the most competitive, prosperous, and resilient economic region of the world. And the strength of our economic relationship among our nations not only supports good-paying jobs in all of our countries, but it generates tremendous growth. Now we're working to a future to strengthen our cooperation on supply chains and critical minerals so we can continue accelerating our efforts to build the technologies of tomorrow right here in North America.
This summitthis summitalso builds on the continual consultation and cooperation with one another to take on the challenges that impact all three of our nations.
Our entire hemisphere is experiencing unprecedented levels of migration, greater than any time in history. And North Americaat the North America Summit Leader inhosted in Washington in 2021, we launched the idea of a regional-wide approacha regional-wide approach to a regional-wide problem. The idea grew into the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection, which 21 countries ultimately adopted at the Summit of the Americas 6 months ago.
And we're working together, especially with our North American partners, to fulfill our commitments under that declaration. They include the policy I announced last week to expand safe and legal pathways for immigrants from Nicaragua, Cuba, and Haiti that were seeking a better life here in the United States of America.
We also want to thank you, Mr. President, for stepping up to receive into Mexico those not following the lawful pathways we've made available, instead ofattempting to unlawfully cross the border between our countries.
On my way here, I stopped in El Paso, Texas, to see the situation with my own eyes and to meet with U.S. border security officials. It's putting real strain on the communities in both Mexico and the United States. We're working together to address this challenge in a way that upholds our nations' laws and protects the human rights of migrants facing desperate circumstances.
We're also working together to take on the scourge of human smuggling and illegal drug trafficking. In just the last 6 months, our joint patrols in Mexico have resulted in the arrest of more than 7,0007,000human smugglers. And we've seized more than 20,000 pounds of deadly fentanyl at the border. And today we've discussed how all three of us can continue to deepen and strengthen our shared efforts to cut off the flow of illegal fentanyl, including by tackling the precursor chemicals used in synthetic drugs as we go after the laboratories where they're made and the stash houses where they're stored.
We also talked about meeting our commitments to make North America a clean energy powerhouseand I believe that's within our graspand a global leader in addressing the climate crisis.
That means working together to promote zero-emissions vehicles, to build charging stations for electric vehicles that are compatible across our international borders. It means exploring shared markets for clean hydrogen. And it means working together to meet our ambitious commitments under the Paris Agreement, including tackling methane and black carbon.
And finally, as three vibrant democracies, we recognize our greatest strength is our people. Let me say that again: Vital democracies we are, and our greatest strength are our people, the strength of our people.
And a key to our competitive edge in the world is our incredible diversity. So, together, we're working to address the inequities that for too long have plagued historically marginalized communities in each of our nations to make sure everyone gets a fair shot. It's one of the smartest investments we can make for our future, and we're going to make it together.
So, Mr. President and Mr. Prime Minister, I'm honored to stand with you today. And I am grateful to have both of you as partners and, I might add, friends as we work together to realize a shared vision for North America.
Thank you very much.
Moderator. Let's give the floor to His Excellency, the Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau.
Prime Minister Trudeau. Bonjour. Good afternoon. Buenas tardes, President Lpez Obrador, mi amigo. Thank you for having us here in Mexico City.
President Biden, my friend, thank you for all your hard work and your valuable insights in today's meetings.
As a continent, we are unique. We are three large democracies committed to freedom, human rights, equality, and creating real opportunity for everyone. We share deep ties as friends and trading partners.
[At this point, Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
During these 30 years, the economies of Mexico, U.S., and Canada have become closely tied because of NAFTA. This trade agreement helped our economies grow and created millions of good employments, and the trade amongst our borders drew investors from the world over.
[Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in English as follows.]
Free trade through NAFTA has helped make our economies among the most competitive in the world. It makes sense why. Combined, we are home to half a billion people. And we have an extraordinarily strong innovation ecosystem. Our combined GDP is larger than that of the European Union. And, as leaders, we are all dedicated to driving economic growth that supports the middle class and those working hard to join it. These are all foundations of a strong and resilient continental economy.
People remember what happened just a few years ago when the certainty of this partnership was in question. Investors, businesses, workers, and citizens all worried about what would happen. When free trade is at risk, that isn't good for competition in the global market.
Thankfully, the belief in free and fair trade won the day. We renegotiated, and we got an even better deal. To put it simply, we are and always will be stronger together.
The world today is facing a lot of uncertainty. With the rise in authoritarian leaders causing global instability and the high cost of living putting stress on families at home, it's important that we come together as leaders and as friends to look at ways to make our economies more resilient.
Today we discussed how we can build reliable value chains on this continent for everything from critical minerals to electric vehicles to semiconductors. This is good for workers, good for consumers, and good for communities across our countries.
[Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
COVID-19 showed us the importance of supply chains and economic resilience, the importance of being prepared, being ready to face a new pandemic, and try to prevent it. Today we spoke about a way to improve our cooperation in the realm of health services in order to be ready to intervene.
[Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in English as follows.]
We can boost our economic resilience even further through our work to build a clean economy. Things like clean energy, including hydrogen, manufacturing zero-emission vehicles, and encouraging more people to adopt them. This is an enormous opportunity for workers and for business.
[Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
We should all be part of climate action. Government and private sector should work together to attain the 2030 goals and objectives. These goals are not only about reducing pollution to get to the Paris objectives, they have to do to ourwith our engagements to preserve 30 percent of our lands and oceans in 2030.
In last COP15 in Montreal, Canada, convened the countries around the world, and we reached a historic agreement to preserve and protect nature. This is essential for the health of the economy.
[Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in English as follows.]
Canada is pleased to have our Mexican and American friends committed so strongly to protecting clean air, clean water, and a brighter future.
Canada is also pleased to see all three countries take steps to moreto build towards building a more diverse, equal, and inclusive society, a society where there is opportunity for everyone, where women and girls are politically and economically empowered, including Indigenous women and girls; where the benefits of growth are felt by workers and families across the economy. By doing this, we create a more stable, prosperous, and equal future, and we build economies that work for all North Americans.
We made progress on a lot of different things today. There's a lot going on in the world right now, and Northas North American leaders, we recognize the roles our countries play in being a source of stability and security, not just in the region, but around the world.
[Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
This summit was extremely fruitful. We were able to reiterate our vision and the force of our partnership.
[Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in English as follows.]
I know we'll make much progress in the coming year. And I look forward to hosting you both in Canada for the next North American Leaders' Summit.
Thank you. Merci. Gracias. 
Moderator. Let's give the floor to Mr. Andrs Manuel Lpez Obrador, President of the United Mexican States.
President Lpez Obrador. I want to thank, in a very sincere fashion, the participation of President Biden and the Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, and also the participation of their respective wives, JillDoctorSophie. And I also want to thank their delegations and teams.
The mere fact of being here together today as good neighbors in this environment of respect to look for the well-being of our peoples in a joint manner is in itself a very important historic event, a true happening.
Nonetheless, I wanted to highlight that we've agreed on strengthening our economic, trade, commercial relations. And for that, we're going to be creating a joint committee aimed at planning and substituting imports in North America so that we may try to be increasingly self-sufficient in this part of the world and to turn development cooperation into a reality, as well as the well-being of all the countries of our continent. We want that to be a reality.
The United States, Canada, and Mexico will proposeeach one of those countries will be proposingfour members for the formation, for the creation of this task force, of this committee of 12 specialists that not only know this issue we are going to be working on, but they will also have our absolute trust to motivate, to persuade, and invite the business community, workers, public servants of all three governments, and to convince them about the importance, the transcendence of being united in North America and for us to be able to seek from here on this unity in everything we do throughout the American continent.
On the part of Mexico in this group, we are going to be represented by Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard; Rogelio Ramrez de la O, Finance Minister of Mexico; Raquel Buenrostro Snchez, who is the Secretary of Economy; and Alfonso Romo Garza, who represents the business community. He's an independent businessman, Mr. Romo is.
And we also discussed as a priority issue economic commercial trade; integration, as I have already expressed, of the entire American continent; and the well-being of the peoples; and the new relations of cooperation, leaving behind interventionismhegemonic interventionism.
Let me do a set-aside here to express my acknowledgement, my recognition to Prime Minister Trudeau and President Biden for the way, which has been so solidary, in which they've acted, in which they are acting vis-a-vis the attempt of coup d'etat in Brazil. This shows that there's a commitmentauthentic commitment in favor of democracy. Our support for President Lula of Brazil.
We have totogether, we have to be able to accomplish all thiseverything that President Biden just said. We have to be able to accomplish this that is on equal footing for us to be treating each other as good neighbors, economic allies, and as friends.
We, of course, will be helping to turn this dream into a reality. And we are very enthused at the certainty that this is something we can accomplish. Peace is the result of justice. Social problems cannot be solved only with coercion measures. We should always attempt to discourage violence and the migration phenomenon with an approachhumanitarian approach of opportunities for the well-being of everyone.
People are good by nature. And it's circumstances that sometimes make it necessary for some ones to take the path of antisocial behaviors. We have seen this in Mexico and also in our sister countries, the countries of Honduras and El Salvador.
For instance, in our country, in Mexico, since corruption is not allowed and the budget is used for development and supporting the poorest sectors of our population, today we not only have jobs, employment, we have seen reductions in violence. We have less migration as well. And we've also tempered frustration. And what we can see is this flamethis flamewhich is alive. I'm talking about the flame of hope. Peace is the fruit, it is the result, of justice.
The Central American case is exceptional. With just a few resources, we are helping producers in communities in Honduras and SalvadorEl Salvador so that they can grow their land, so that they can grow their crops with technical assistance, support, and basic income.
And in those towns where we are applying those actionsparticularly the program we call Sembrando Vida, which means ""sowing life,"" and Youth Building the Future Programwe've not just seen a reduction of people wanting to migrate to the United States seeking opportunities of better living conditions and jobs, but for many young people of those countries, crime has stopped being the only possibility of survival and the only way to move forward in life.
The migration issue, as many other issues, was discussed in a very broad fashion. And we reached important agreements among the three countries for the benefit of our peoples, as you will be able to see, as you will also be able to know, through a communiquea joint communique that we have that will be provided to you immediately.
Finally, I want to thank Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for his extraordinary and fraternal program that consists of granting temporary working visas for laborers, workers. This program is already benefiting 25,000 men and women25,000 Mexicans. This is a path to follow that is orderly migration. Prime Minister Trudeau is a great ally of Mexico.
President Biden, I want to thank you sincerely for maintaining with Mexico a relationship of cooperation, of friendshipsincere friendship, sirof respect for our fellow man who live and work in a very honest fashion in the United States who are not harassed. They're not suffering raids as it unfortunately used to happen in the past.
We have said this and I repeat it todayI insist on this: You, President Biden, you are the first President of the United States in a very long time that has not built not even 1 meter of wall. And thatwe thank you for that, sir, although some might not like it, although the conservatives don't like it.
In a very special manner, I also want to say that I have requested in a very respectful manner, President BidenI have requested on insistingand I know that this is not a simple issue or matter, but it's a fair and very just matter. And that's why I'm proposing it. That's why I'm mentioning this. And also because I trulyI fully trust President Biden.
I've asked President Biden to insist before the U.S. Congress to regularize the migration situations of millions of Mexicans who have been in the States working, living in the United States, and contributing to the development of that great Nation, which is the United States of America.
I have reasserted, reaffirmed that President Biden is a man with convictions who maintains principles, ideals to guarantee, to ensure as many othersmen, women in the United States and throughout the worldand the Statue of Liberty never, never, ever should become a symbola void, an empty symbol.
Let me conclude by saying that my professor, great poet, Carlos Pellicermy master, my teacherin 1930, he said that the wish of freedom, of liberty is the biggest fruit that has materialized that is in the heart of humans. To be doing that, we have to be free. The sentiments of justice are the children of freedom, of liberty. Never, ever being slaves can wewill we be able to be just and fair.
Thank you very much.
Moderator. Now let's begin a Q&A session. Ladies and gentlemen and the U.S. press; Your Excellency, Joseph Biden, Jr., President of the United States of America, yes, will take a question from a journalist, a reporter from the United States.
Please.
President Biden. All right. I was having trouble hearing, but I'd like to call on Associated Press, Colleen Long, for the first question.
Classified Documents Found in President Biden's Former Office/Immigration 
Q. Thanks, Mr. President. Hola, Seor. And hi, Prime Minister Trudeau.
For Mr. President, you've been accused of being too soft on border security and now too hard, following the recent border policy changes. What's the right balance?
And on the news at home, can you explain how classified documents ended up in one of your offices? And should the public gethave been notified sooner?
For Prime Minister Trudeau, there's been a suggestion that Canada lead a multinational security force in Haiti. I wondered if that was a possibility and what you would need.
Y seor, usted Presidente, muchas gracias por la bienvenida esta semana. Quiero preguntar: You said that you would acceptyou would be willing to accept more migrants arriving to the U.S.-Mexico border. What do you want from the U.S. in return?
President Biden. I'll answer first?
Well, let me get rid of the easy one first. People know I take classified documents and classified information seriously.
When my lawyers were clearing out my office at the University of Pennsylvania, they set up an office for mea secure office in the Capital, when Ithe 4 years after being Vice President, I was a professor at Penn.
They found some documents in a boxyou know, a locked cabinet, or at least a closet. And as soon as they did, they realized there were several classified documents in that box. And they did what they should have done: They immediately called the Archivesimmediately called the Archivesturned them over to the Archives. And I was briefed about this discovery and surprised to learn that there were any Government records that were taken there to that office.
But I don't know what's in the documents. I'vemy lawyers have not suggested I ask what documents they were. I've turned over the boxesthey've turned over the boxes to the Archives. And we're cooperating fullycooperating fullywith the review, andwhich I hope will be finished soon, and will be more detail at that time.
The first question, now I forgot. [Laughter] No. Your first question related to
Q. Iyes, I asked if weI asked if the
President Biden. I'm only joking.
Q. Oh. [Laughter]
President Biden. The answer isthe answer is, you've got bothboth the extremes are wrong. It's a basic middle proposition.
Now, look, as was mentioned by all of us in one way or another, this has been the greatest migration in human history around the world, as well as in this hemisphere. And when I got elected, the first thing Ithe first major piece of legislation I introduced was to reform the immigration process, to make it more orderly, to make it moreto make sure people have access under the law.
And so what we found outand not just in my visit to El Paso, but before thatwe found out is that our Republican friends and somea few Democratsare very critical of what's going on at the border, but yet refuse to even look at the detail document I submitted for the Congress to consider to reform the process completely.
And so, number one, right now a majority of our migrants are coming from four countries: Venezuela, Cuba, Haiti, and Nicaragua. And we're expanding the very successful parole program we had, with regard to Venezuela, to Cuba and to Nicaragua and to Haiti to provide safe and orderly and humane processing for people fleeing those countries to come to the United States and claiming under theseeking asylum.
This is going to reduce the number of people legally trying to crossillegally trying to cross the border. Venezuelans were trying to enter the country. That they droppedthat has dropped off dramatically because we've allowed them to go directly to whatever countrythe first country they go to, directly contact the United States, make sure that they make their application showing that they havethey do a background check; they, in fact, have access to a sponsor; and that they have beenthey've been examined. And that way, they're able to come through ports of entry.
And it's dropped offwe haveI'm going to make sure I get the numbers rightdramatically from 1,100 persons trying to enter toper dayto 250 a day.
I've asked theand I want to thank the President of Mexico for agreeing to take up to 3,000 people back in asthat don't meet this criteria. Because, look, right now the cartels make a lot of money, which they use for drug trafficking as well. People go throughhave to make it through jungles and a long journey to the border. And many are victimized, not only in terms of what they have to pay, but victimized physically in other ways.
And so we're trying to make it easier for people to get here, opening up the capacity to get here, but not have them go through that God-awful process.
And we're going to continue our efforts to address the root causes of migration to help people stay in their home countries. I've asked the Congress for $4 billion to provide for that. We've also had our Vice President provide for private donations of over $3 billion to make sure that peoplelook, all of you know all of us in the United States are immigrants. Mine go all the way back to the Irish famine. But the point is, all of us have been immigrants.
And one of the things that comes across fairly clearly is, it's not like people sit in their home city, county, town and say: ""I've got a great idea. Let's sell everything we have, give it to a coyote, go through some jungles and a long path up to the United States, smuggle us across the border, drop us in a desert. And won't that be fun in a country we don't even speak the language?""
We havewe can do more than merely just make legal immigration more streamlined. But we can also do it by preventing people from wanting to have to leave in the first place, by helping their communities, in fact, better their circumstances.
And so I hopeyou know, and by the way, my proposals are supported by the Chamber of Commerce, by the American labor movement, notI mean, which is an unusual coalitionand a whole range of people. The point here is that my Republican friends in Congress should join us in the solutions.
And the one last point I'll makeand I'm sorry to go on so long, but we spent a lot of time talking about itis we have to increase the technological capabilities at the border, both to intercept illegal drugs and other contraband, as well as people being smuggled across the border.
We have now the ability to use, and usesome of you have seen them; I know you all, you have, I'm surethese trucks that ride alongside of a tractor trailer. It's like a giant X-ray machine, and it can determine what's inside that tractor-trailer. And thousands cross the border every day in illegal commerce. And so we're allowed to determine whether or not therefentanyl is in there, drugs in there, people being smuggled across the border.
We're going to provide significantly more of those vehicles for the people to be able to determine at the border what needwhatwhat is coming across legally and illegally.
A lot more to say, but I probably already said too much. Thank you.
Moderator. David Cochrane, CBC, from Canada, will be asking to Prime Minister Trudeau.
Prime Minister Trudeau. I'll take your question. And I'll fold the Haiti question in as well.
Q. Okay, thank you, Prime Minister. A question for you and for President Biden as well.
President Biden, you've talked a lot about economic cooperation and building continental supply chains and resilience here. But since you've been President, Canadians have seen what they consider to be protectionistU.S. protectionism from you in things such as the Buy American Act. So what assurances can you give to Canadians and Mexicans watching this at home that they will be equal partners in the economic opportunity you're talking about in this transition and not have to confront further attempts at American protectionism?
President Lpez Obrador, if you have anything to say on that, we'd love to hear it.
And, Prime Minister Trudeau, if you can answer the Haiti question, but also explain to us what steps your Government needs to take to take advantage of this opportunity on the continental supply chain resiliency to ensure that Canadian companies make things like semiconductors and don't just supply critical minerals to American companies.
Prime Minister Trudeau. Thank you very much. First, on Haiti, the situation in Haiti is heartbreaking. Canada has stood with the people of Haiti for decades, including over the past 3 years with multiple interventions with the U.N., with other partners on the ground; military interventions, police interventions, even prison guards.
We have continued to stand with the people of Haiti, and we will continue to. Obviously, this current situation is heart wrenching and we need to continue to be there for the people of Haiti. But we need to make sure that the solutions are driven by the people of Haiti themselves.
That's why Canada's focus, as we stepped up over the past months, has been, first of all, in putting significant sanctions on the elites who are responsible for so much of the violence and political instability in Haiti. A handful of small, extraordinarily wealthy families in Haiti have been causing much of the strife because of political and pecuniary interests. And that is why the sanctions that Canada has put forward are causing significant impacts on the ground.
We're also moving forward with significant supports for the Haitian National Police, including with armored vehiclesthe Americans have stepped up on as wellto ensure that the police is able to stabilize the situation on the ground.
Obviously, there's much more to do. We've sent down a group of interlocutors to work both on the political side, but also to liaise directly with the security officials on the ground so that we can be responsive in immediate ways to what is needed for the Haitian National Police to get a better control and ensure greater stability for the people of Haiti.
The U.N. called in September for the free flow of food, medicines, water, and fuel. Much of that has started again. It's still not where it needs to be, but we're going to continue to lean in on ensuring that that happens.
But at the same time, we are working with partners across the Caribbean and, indeed, with the United States and Mexico to ensure that if the situation starts to deteriorate once again, we will have options.
But like I said, we're going to make sure that what we do this time allows for the Haitian people to get the situation under control. And a big part of that is putting those sanctions on the Haitian leadership that are responsible for so much of the misery people are going through.
In regards to the continental supply chain, that was at the center of our conversations throughout this North American Leaders' Summit. The idea that we already work extraordinarily well together with NAFTA, but there's so much more we can be doing at a time where supply chains around the world are under increasing stress and significant economic actors around the world are becoming less reliable as partners and less desirable as partners in building the technologies and the energy futures that we want.
That's whyyou brought up a few examples of itour critical minerals approach, a strategy that we just released a few weeks ago, is focused not just on mining the critical minerals that Canada has, that North America and the world needs, in responsible environmental partnership with Indigenous Peoples doing it the right way, but also the development, the processing, the transforming into batteries, the transforming into technology that goes along the value chain as something that is important for Canada.
And yes, it's something that we're continuing to look at. That's the same thing with electric vehicles, where we're building electric vehicles with our partners in Mexico and in the United States.
But Canadaagain, from the critical minerals that go into the batteries and the batteries themselves that we're starting to build, to the steel and aluminum that is amongst the cleanest in the world being developed in Canada, to the technology, the innovation, from AI to engineering that is part of itCanada is very much a partner in what we're developing in terms of more resilient supply chain. So there's lots more to do.
Indeed, even on semiconductors, the largest semiconductor packaging plant in North America, I believe, is in Bromont, Quebec. And packaging of semiconductors is actually how you assemble them into a unit that can then do the high-value calculations and computations that need to happen.
These are the kinds of things that Canada is very much focused on in ensuring not just prosperity right now, but good jobs as we move towards a environmentally responsible, net-zero, socially inclusive future that the middle class in all three of our countries are relying on.
Q. [Inaudible]
[Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
Prime Minister Trudeau. Briefly, in French: In regard to Haiti, Canada has always been there to help the Haitian people, and we are working with our partners in the region to guarantee better solutions for the Haitian people. We have laid sanctions against the elites. We are helping the National Police in Haiti.
We have had good exchanges, good dialogues with our partners in the U.S. and Caribbean countries to guarantee that we will be able to preserve and to have the people of Haiti at the center of the solutions.
In regard to the economic integration and the competitiveness in North America, be it electric vehicles, be it Critical Minerals Strategy minerals, and the ones we're going to develop to produce the necessary technologies or in regard to any other technologies in order to work together, because we know that North America can offer many solutions, great competitiveness to the rest of the world, and we are a true force to reckon with in our continent.
Moderator. Sara Pablo of the Formula Group will pose a question to the constitutional President of the United Mexican States.
Q. Yes. Good afternoon, Presidents, Prime Minister. And we have a few questions for President Biden.
I know that recently you announced the United States will be receiving citizens from Venezuela, Haiti, Cuba, and Nicaragua. What is the timeframe? And are you thinking of expanding the number of people you will be receiving? And is thissome other nations could be included? And what is the amount in technological improvements in the United States?
And for President Lpez Obrador: How will Mexico be prepared to receive all the migrants the United States will be expelling from its territory? And the new migration center in the southern part of Mexico, what is it all about?
And then, after this 10th summit, are we going to be seeing changes in migration policies in the way migrants are being treated?
And finally, let methis is for President Biden: fentanyl. What concrete actions are you going to be implementing? What's the impact of the detention of Ovidio Guzmn? Because the Cartel of the Pacific is one of the main fentanyl producers.
And finally, another question on energy sector consultations. President Biden, Prime Minister Trudeau, did you discuss those discussions about the USMCA, the T-MEC?
President Lpez Obrador. Very well. We did speak about migration in a very broad manner. Of course, there is cooperation with the U.S. administration. And at the same time, we have a commitment to protect migrants.
What President Biden has proposed is absolutely true. If migrants cross our countryand, in some cases, they also go through other countries in Latin Americato arrive in the United States, migrants are facing so many risks when they do that, starting with the fact that they are victims of the trafficantsthe smugglersthe human traffickers known as the coyotes or polleros. And they charge migrants a high amount of money to take them northbound.
Now, those polleros or coyotes have networks. And at the same time, they hire trailers, truckstruck trailers. The box of the trailer, they can transport up to 300, 400 people. So theconstant accidents are taking place on the highways of Mexico, the roads of Mexico, unfortunately.
And the worst of it all is that many migrants are being kidnapped by criminal groups, by criminals. They're being murdered. And this is very sad, very painful.
That's why I'm speaking about protection. Wewhat we want is an in-depth solution. We've always said that peoplejust as President Biden said, people do not leave their towns, their countries, their families because they like to do it. This is not a pleasure for them. They do it because of the needs they have. This is a necessity.
We've always said we have to look at the root causes of all this. We have to try for people to be able to work and be happy where they were born, where their relatives, their customs, their traditions, their cultures are. And we need to invest for that. We need to invest in development of the countries with more inequality and poverty, because migration has to be an optional thing, not a forced situation.
However, in the meantimebecause we're, of course, doing everything we can to accomplish thisMexico, with just a few resources, is helping. I have already mentioned that we are workingwe are working with communities in El Salvador, in Honduras. We're going to be starting this in Guatemala and Belize as well.
However, we do need to promote development even moreand well-beingto ensure, guarantee opportunities for those that are forced to migrate and leave their communities.
We are not thinking of building any center in the southeastern part of Mexicoany migration center. We're not thinking of that. What we do is help with shelters, with health care services, with food services as well. That's the way we help migrants.
And we do celebrate the fact that the U.S. administration has takenmade the decision, rather, to have an orderly migration flow in the case, for instance, of our Venezuelan brothers and sisters. And I understand that this plan will also be extendedwill be expanded to benefit other migrants, other countries.
We know for sure that since the announcement was made saying that those permits, humanitarian visas were going to be granted in the case, for instance, of the Venezuelan population, we've seen a decrease in migration flows, or people crossing Mexico to migrate.
This has been a considerable reduction because this was announced in the United States, and this was made public everywhere, saying that 24,000 humanitarian visas or permits were going to be granted and that the formalities had to be covered, the paperwork. Although there are some requirements that have to be met, people decided to do it. So what happened was that a new path has been opened; it didn't exist before.
Everything was arriving in the United States, risking everythingrisking people's lives, of course, at the risk of their own lives. Now that this mechanism has been approved, people can file their own request. And this might take time. However, there's hope. A hope that this isa purpose is going to be accomplished: the purpose of going to the United States to work, to live.
We celebrate this, and we think thatI insist what Canada is doing is also the right thing to do.
And I was talking about our own experience as well. And you can look at data. It's there for you to look at. Because of circumstances in the past, migration corresponded to the sister countries of Central America that werethose were the main migration flows from Central Americabut, for a long time as well, Mexicans migrating who were going to look for a better living standard, who were going to look for a job in the United States.
And just imagine: There are 40 million Mexicans in the United States40 million who were born here in Mexico, or they're the children of people who were born in Mexico.
Now, what have we been able to accomplish with all the support for well-being? We've reduced the number of Mexican migrants, yes. There are less migrants abandoning Mexico now because there's public investment; because out of 35 million families, 30 million families of Mexican families are now receiving at least a programa well-being program. And this is a very direct manner of doing this here in Mexico.
All the senior citizens, 65 or over, receive a pension. This is a universal program in Mexico. Eleven million of senior citizens in Mexico are getting a pension. Eleven million students of low-income families, of poor families are getting grants. They're getting scholarships. All the boys and girls with disabilities also have their own pension.
We have a program for reforestation. It is the most important reforestation program in the world. And we are planting over 1 million hectares of fruit and timber trees. And we are giving jobs to over 400,000 peasants that are growing, planting those trees.
So, then, all these programs help so that people may be staying in their own communities, in their towns.
We built the Dos Bocas refinery35,000 jobs. We are now building the Mayan train, which is the biggest railroad works in the world because it's 1,554 kilometers1,554 kilometersin five States of Mexico.
All the Maya regionwhich is one of the most important archaeological zones of the worldwell, there, people are working, building this railroad system. About 300,000 people are building the train. So that's really the option. That's the path to follow: development, well-being.
And I insist, I repeat: I truly celebrate that the Canadian Government and the U.S. administration, as well, are now attending to the migration problem with this type of approach. It's quite lamentable that there are othersother politicians, other Presidents and public officials who are acting in a very inhuman manner.
Right now, in this winter season, for instance, with all due respectI'm not saying this in a very direct manner, but what I'm saying is that, I mean, one of the Governors of our neighboring country headed a movement to take migrants to New York, to Washington, and just drop them there. This is politicking. This is completely inhuman. This should not be done. Because there are those who forget that we are all migrants.
How is it that that great nation, the United States, was developed? With migrants. Thanks to that, so then we have to continue seeking, looking for alternatives. Just as, for instance, also in the case of violence, we have to look into the root causes of violence.
And also in the case of our country, youth were never cared for. No services for young people. And the only thing that was done was call them young people who didn't work, who didn't study. This is a discriminatory labeling for youth. ""They don't study; they don't work."" Ninis, they were called in Mexico. They don't do one thing. They don't do the other thing either.
So no one was ever caring for our youth in Mexico. All those young people only hadthe only option they had, I mean, was to migrate. And many migrated, acting in a respectful manner, a very responsible fashion. And others as well were trying to make a living because they didn't have any other opportunities. So they made a living in what we call the ""informal economy,"" which is, you know, making a living out in the street, no matter what. I mean, whichever way you can make a living without falling into illicit activities. However, unfortunately, many did go into the path of antisocial behaviors.
But we didn't really take care of young people in Mexico. However, we now have a program devoted to young people. This program never existed in the past. There are 2.4 million young people who are being hired. They are working, and they're apprentices.
What are we doing? We are taking away from them this culture, those seats, the reserves, the stock. We're taking that away from criminal groups. We're taking youthwe don't want our youth to be hooked. We don't want those criminal groups to be taking our youth away. We want to give them opportunities. That's exactly what we're doing in Mexico.
And let me conclude also highlighting another difference which is quite important: There is no corruption in the administration, the Government that I represent. There's no impunity either.
There'swe have painted this line that is very clear. Crime is one thing, and the authority is a different thing. There is no criminal association or partnership as before.
Yes, this iswe're even ashamed to mention this, thatto mention that those who were in charge of guaranteeing or ensuring public security were at the servicein the pastwere at the service of criminal organizations. This doesn't happen in Mexico anymore.
That's why in this meeting, this summit we just held today, all three governments of the three countries, we have reached agreements to continue working together to get peaceto have peace in all three countries so that we can ensure and guarantee security of our peoples.
That's all I wanted to answer to your question, Madam.
Q. On fentanyl? On fentanyl and energy consultations?
President Lpez Obrador. Yes, we are doing that. Just as I was telling you that in the case of migration, first there were brothers and sisters from Central America and also from Mexico, but now, in recent times, a lot of migrants from Venezuela, from Nicaragua, Colombia, Ecuador.
We do have a situation. This is athese are changes in places where we'replaces where people are being pushed to leave their towns, their place of origin for many reasons.
And with drugs, we have a case in point. It is not cannabis. It's not marijuana. It's not poppiespoppy. It's not only cocaine either. Now, we have fentanyl and chemicals, which are some of the most dangerous type of substance and very harmful for people because they are causing so many deaths.
So then, we're working on this in an organized manner. In the case of Mexico, this led us to make all the ports in the customs offices to be controlled by the armed forces in Mexico, all the sea customs office, because fentanyl and other chemicals come from Asia, and they are processed in labs. And we are avoiding the entrance of those chemical substances, and we are destroying labs.
The Navy Secretariat is in charge of managing ports and customssea customs offices. For instance, we had so much trafficking of chemicals in the port of Manzanillo and also in Lzaro Crdenas. Now, the Navy is in charge of controlling those customs.
And all the customs, the land customs offices along the border line are now under the responsibility of the Ministry of DefenseNational Defense Ministry.
So we are combating fentanyl and those chemicals, and we're doing this because we care. Nothing human is alien to us. We truly care being able to help and to be of helpthe situation in the United Statesdeaths because of overdose of fentanyl.
Andbut just as we discussed today, this is not only an issue of the United States. The thing is that if we do not face this problem, this scourge, we are going to suffer it ourselves as well. So we have to act in a coordinated fashion. And that is something we have been doing, and we discussed it in this summit. It is in the communique we are about to give you. And we are defending lifethe life.
As I was telling youI was telling Prime Minister Trudeau and President Bidentheir teams, I was telling them as well: We only have two campaignspublicity or propaganda campaignsin the Government, in my administration. One is dedicated or devoted to not consuming drugs: ""Say no to drugs."" Because we have to also think of that. It became quite a famous thingpublic fame. Everything related to gangs. They are even series of gangs and organized crimegangs of organized crimes.
And this is like an apology of that which is desirable, because there are residences, very rich homes in those series, very luxurious homes, and the cars. Men and womenall very good lookingvery handsome men and women well dressed with jewelry all over the place, with a lot of power. And they pick up the phone, and they call the head of the police force, head of the military, or even a President of a country. And that's what's being disseminated all over.
But we have seen a series on the damage caused by fentanyl, how, in 6 months, the life of a young person is destroyed. And what those doses contain, they have muriatic acid. Do people inform about the situation? Do people let other people know about this? No, of course not. So we are going to be launching an information campaign.
As I was telling the President and the Prime Minister, I said vapersyes, they say: ""Well, they're not bad. I mean, they just have five substances. That's it. But they're not bad.""
We did some research on this. Over 30 substances, harmful and cancer-causing substances in those devices people smoke with. However, because of the lobbying, corruption as well, the publicity or advertising management, thenthis is being allowed.
And there are many parents and mothers, fathers who don't even know the damage that theirour children are going through because of vapors. We have to look into this.
But, really, this is not only the responsibility of the Government, this is also the responsibility of the media. You can also help us so much on this to, you know, spread the word, to inform people. Radio stations, television networksthey should be devoting time for this to inform people, to guide people on this on how bad drugs can be for people's health and that people can be successful and they can be happy without having, without needing to fall into drug addiction, those mortal traps.
Well, all this, that's what we've been discussing. I think I'm taking more than the time that I should have taken. It's cold outside.
Thank you so much, everyone. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Thank you. Thank you so much.
President Biden. I want the record to show: I don't know what questions I didn't answer. I'm prepared later. Thank you very much. [Laughter]

2022-11-15 00:00:00,"Remarks at a Meeting of the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment in Bali, Indonesia","
Well, good afternoon, everyone. We haven't heard enough from everybody, so we're going to go another 5 hours. [Laughter]
I want to welcome you all. TheI'm going to make some brief opening comments and then yield to my friend, who's been doing not much today except doing this all day, and then toas much as I'd like to go to President von der Leyen, who I like better than anybody here. Butso we're going to begin now.
Folks, good afternoon. I want to thank everyone for being here.
[At this point, President Biden briefly addressed President Joko ""Jokowi"" Widodo of Indonesia, seated to his right, as follows.]
You've done a tremendous job, by the way, forreally. You've done a great job.
And focusing on our efforts of the G-20
[President Biden checked his microphone.]
Do I have this on? Yes.
the G-20 toward restoring and recovering together and recovering stronger. As we were saying outsidewe were having a photograph takenI'm convinced we're going to come out of this crisis we've been through, and the pandemic and other things, stronger than we went in. Every time we engage, we get better.
And Itoday we're focused on investing together and investing stronger than we have in the past. In June, I joined my fellow G-7 leaders to officially launch the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, with the collective goal of mobilizing $600 billion in 5 years for quality, sustainability, and innovative infrastructure, and investments in low- and middle-income countries.
As I've spoken with themy Canadian friends, this is something that we have an obligation to do, it seems to me, to deal with those nations that are not the primary cause of many of our problems, but are now left with a great deal of difficulty. I want to emphasize the word ""investments""investments that are driven by local needs, in development with our partners, and delivering real results to improve the lives of all of our people.
Through the partnership, we've already launched an array of new projects with countries across the G-20 and beyond, collaborating in new ways on climate, energy security, and digital connectivity, health infrastructure, and gender equity and gender equality.
And let me give you some examples of the work we've been doing. First, in climate and on energy security: As we accelerate our investment and speed transition to clean energy future to meet the climate crisis head on, we have to make sure that they benefit people everywhereeverywherenot just in the larger countries. And that's why we're proud to partner with Indonesia and Japan under both of our colleaguesan unflagging leadership from both of themtogether with a broad coalition of countries to create the Just Energy Transition Partnershipnot ""just"" like ""soon,"" but ""to be just"" energy partnership.
Also critical to this effort has been the work of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, cochaired by my friend and champion of global climate efforts, Mike Bloomberg. Together, we hope to mobilizewe're mobilizing $20 billion to support Indonesia's efforts to reduce emissions and expand renewable energy and support workers in the most affectedwho are most affected by the transition away from coal, and that can be difficult. That $20 billion from partner governments and some of the world's leading financial institutions will accelerate an ambitious energy transition that has a global impact.
We also plan to invest $798 million through the new Millennium Challenge Corporation, with Indonesia, which will build climate-resilient transportation and support Indonesia's development goals.
And around the world, we're also investing in critical minerals, supply chains, and technology needed for a clean energy transition. For example, in Honduras, the Export-Import Bank is financing one of the largest ever solar projects in the Americas. In Brazil, the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation has invested $30 million in equity in TechMet Limited's mining in nickelforto mine nickel and cobalt, two of the minerals most needed to power electric vehicles and other clean energy technologies. Together, these investments are going to create jobs in the communities where this mining takes place, and they support and help curb climate changeend global climate change.
Next, we're investing in digital connectivity. As a matter of fact, when I was elected President, we invested in an infrastructure project at home because we found outwe focused on this, and we found out a significant portion of the people in my country, as wealthy as we've been, aredid not have access to the internet. And so we'vewe'rewe came up with a billion, 200 million dollars in infrastructure to make sure every single communityrural communities and others. Well, that's the case all around the world.
And so we'rethis digital connectivity, we're teaming up with a range of partners to ensure people have access to the internetaffordable access to the internetand other technologies. Wethese technologies are required to participate in today's economies. Andfor example, we're working together with Japan and Australia to upgrade networks in Papua New Guinea and across the Pacific, improving security, performance, and access to digital services.
And through the United States Digital Investment [Invest; White House correction] blended finance program, we are working with Kenya partner CSquared to establish a nationwide fiber network in Liberia that's going to help connect 1 million Liberians to the web.
And the next is health infrastructure. We've seen over the last few years, strengthening health security must bemust bea priority for all of us. We just went through a long discussion on that. That's why we're continuing to support vaccine manufacturing in Africa and Asia and investing $15 million through the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation in India's health infrastructure, as just a few examples.
And finally, gender equity and gender equality. When we invest in equal opportunity for women, we can deliver greater prosperity for everyonefor everyone. And so we're working with the G-7 nations and the World Bank to launch the Invest in Childcare initiative to help families get children they needget the childcare they need, and help women get the opportunities they deserve to be able to be in the workforce.
We're already starting to see returns. For example, the initiative has funded a project in Somalia, and that will help nearly 300,000 women across the country to build literacy and leadership skills.
These are just some of the projects where our countries are stepping up to deliver impact investments. And we're at an inflection point. Investments we make today will have far-reaching impacts on the world for generations to come. If we don't make them, it will also have far-reaching impactsif we don't make these investments.
And so creating real opportunity, greater equality, and a more secure, healthy, and prosperous world is what we're all about. Moving forward, we have to continue to invest together and invest stronger. And we welcome all who share this vision to join this partnership.
And I want to thank you. And now I'd like to turn it over to a man we haven't heard from for the last few days[laughter]Widodo. It's all yours, Joko.

The President. Thanks for being here. Ias you saw, I just met with the leaders of NATO and the G-7 andto talk about the latest events in Europe, and I briefed them on my discussions with President Duda of Poland, as well as NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg. And we agreed to support Poland's investigation into the explosion in rural Poland, near the Ukrainian border. And I'm going to make sure we figure out exactly what happened.
Our empathysympathy goes out toapparently, two people were killed.
And then we're going to collectively determine our next step as we investigate and proceed. There was total unanimity among the folks at the table.
And we also discussed the latest series of Russian missile attacks, which are continuing the brutality and inhumanity that they've demonstrated throughout this war against Ukrainian cities and civilian infrastructures. And it'sthey've been totally unconscionable, what they're doing. Totally unconscionable.
And the moment when the world had come together at the G-20 to urge deescalation, Russia continues tohas chosen to escalate in Ukraine, while we're meeting. I mean, there were scores and scores of attacksmissile attacks into western Ukraine.
We support Ukraine fully in this moment, and we have since the start of this conflict. And we're going to continue to do whatever it takes to give them the capacity to defend themselves.
Explosion in Eastern Poland/Russia 
Q. Mr. President, is it too early to say whether this missile was fired from Russia?
The President. There is preliminary information that contests that. I don't want to say that until we completely investigate. But it isIit's unlikely, in the minds of the trajectory, that it was fired from Russia. But we'll see. We'll see.
Q. Unlikely, sir?
North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
Q. Mr. President, has Poland suggested invoking article 4 or 5 from NATO, sir?
The President. The consensus is, we're going to probably have a meeting of the Ambassadors. So that'sit looks like we're going to go do next.

2022-11-14 00:00:00,"The President's News Conference in Bali, Indonesia","
The President. Welcome to Bali. [Laughter] Please.
Good evening, everyone.
Let me start with a few words about the recent elections held in the United States. What we saw was the strength and resilience of the American democracy, and we saw it in action. And the American people proved once again that democracy is who we are.
And there was a strong rejection of election deniers at every level, from those seeking to lead our States and those seeking to serve in Congress and also those seeking to oversee the elections. And there was a strong rejection of political violence and voter intimidation. And there was an emphatic statement that in America, the will of the people prevails.
I haveI've traveled this week, and it's been clear just how closely the world and our allies and our competitors as well have been following our elections at home.
[At this point, the President cleared his throat.]
Excuse me, I have a little cold.
And what these elections showed is that there is a deep and unwavering commitment in America to preserving and protecting and defending democracy.
Now, let me speak briefly about our agenda over the past few days in Egypt and in Cambodia and here in Indonesia. In this moment of great global challengesfrom global inflation to the climate crisis, to Russia's brutal war against Ukrainewe're bringing together the broadest possible coalition of partners to deliver results.
At COP27 in Egypt, I made it clear that thanks to the bold agenda of our administration we pursued from day one to tackle the climate crisis and advance energy and security at home and around the world, the United States will meetthe United States will meetour emissions target under thetargets under the Paris Agreement.
And we're going to keep working with our partners to support the most vulnerable countries in building resilience to climate impacts and to align global ambition with the 1.5-degree Celsius goal, while supercharging our clean energy transition.
At the U.S.-ASEAN summit and the East Asia Summit, I laid out a commitment forto working with our partners in the Indo-Pacific to ensure a future that's vital to this region, that's free and open and prosperous, as well as secure.
And I met with our allies from Australia, Japan, and the Republic of Korea, underscoring our commitment and deepening our engagement with our closest partners, and strengthening cooperation among our allies to meet shared threats to our own security and to their security, including the D.P.R.K.
And let me meetI just met in person with Xi Jinping of the People's Republic of China. We had
[The President cleared his throat.]
Excuse me. We had an open and candid conversation about our intentions and our priorities. It was clearhe was clear, and I was clearthat we'll defend American interests and values, promote universal human rights, and stand up for the international order and work in lockstep with our allies and partners.
We're going to compete vigorously. But I'm not looking for conflict; I'm looking to manage this competition responsibly. And I want to make sure that every country abides by the international rules of the road. And we discussed that.
The ""one China"" policyour ""one China"" policy has not changedhas not changed. We oppose unilateral change in the status quo by either side, and we're committed to maintaining the peace and stability in the Taiwan Straits.
It was also clear that China and the United States should be able to work together where we can to solve global challenges that require every nation to do its part. We discussed Russia's aggression against Ukraine, reaffirmed our shared belief in the threat where the use of nuclear weapons is totally unacceptable. And I asked that Secretary Blinken travel to China to follow up on our discussions and continue keeping the lines of communication open between our two countries.
Looking ahead at the G-20 meetings tomorrow, we're going to be talkingtaking on the very issues that matter to the people's lives, not only here, but also our allies and our partners. That means tackling the suffering that Russian aggression has unleashed, not just on Ukrainian people, but the people around the world, particularly food insecurity, and strengthening the fundamentals of our global economy for everyone: support for debt relief, reforms for multilateral development banks, investments to bolster global health security and to make thesure the world is better prepared for the next pandemic.
The G-20 has been an important forum for the world's largest economies to work together for the good of people everywhere, and I'm looking forward to our meetings tomorrow.
Now, let me close with this: On my first trip overseas last year, I said that America was backback at home, back at the table, and back to leading the world.
In the year and a half that's followed, we've shown exactly what that means. America is keeping its commitments. America is investing in our strength at home. America is working alongside our allies and partners to deliver real, meaningful progress around the world. And at this critical moment, no nation is better positioned to help build the future we want than the United States of America.
Now I'm happy to take questions. And I'm told there are going to be 4 questioners, but I'm not going to do 10 questions from each questioner[laughter]all right? I'll make that clear at the outset here.
And[laughter]so, Ken Thomas, Wall Street Journal.
China-U.S. Relations/Taiwan 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You said at the outset of this meeting that you did not want competition to turn into conflict. Based on this meeting today, do you believe a new cold war with China can be avoided?
And specifically, on the issue of Taiwan, you spoke about intentions. Do you believe China is preparing, intending to invade Taiwan at some point? And what warnings did you issue to President Xi if he were to take such action?
The President. Well, to answer the first part of your question, I absolutely believe there'sneed not be a new cold war. WeI've met many times with Xi Jinping, and we were candid and clear with one another across the board. And I do not think there's any imminent attempt on the part of China to invade Taiwan.
And I made it clear that our policy in Taiwan has not changed at all. It's the same exact position we've had. I made it clear that we want to see cross-strait issues peacefully resolved. And so it never has to come to that. And I'm convinced that he understood exactly what I was saying. I understood what he was saying.
And look, I think the United States is better prepared than any country in the world, economically and politically, to deal with the changing circumstances around the world.
And I think thatI think Xi Jinping iswe agreed that we would set up a set of circumstances where on issues that werethat we had to further resolve details, we agreed that we would have our chief of staffourthe appropriate Cabinet members and others sit and meet with one another to discuss the details of anyevery issue that wethat was raised, and we raised a lot of issues.
Seung Kim, Associated Press.
China-U.S. Relations/Impact of the 2022 Midterm Elections on U.S. Foreign Policy 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You met with President Xi, and you met with him face to face after he had unquestionably consolidated his power at home. So now that you've met with him face to face, how do you assess his sort of posture towards the United States now? And did you find him personally to be more confrontational or more conciliatory and willing to compromise?
The President. Neither. And yes.
Q. Can you elaborate?
The President. Yes, I didn't find him more confrontational or more conciliatory. I found him the way he's always been: direct and straightforward.
And do I think he's willing to compromise on various issues? Yes. I think he understands thatlook, I thinkhow can I say this tactfully? I think the election held in the United States wasstill leaves a little bit uncertainhas sent a very strong message around the world that the United States is ready to play.
The United States isthe Republicans who survived, and along with the Democrats, are of the view that we're going to stay fully engaged in the world and that we, in fact, know what we're about. And so I don't get any sense that there's more or less confrontation.
We were very blunt with one another about places where we disagreed or where we were uncertain of each other's position. And we agreed we'd set upand we didmechanisms whereby we would meet in detail with ourthe key people in each of our administrations to discuss how we could resolve them, or how, if they weren't resolved, on what basis were they not resolved.
Sebastian Smith, the AFP.
Q. Thank you very much, Mr. President. That's truly close. [Laughter] Excuse me, I don't usually talk that loudly.
Ukraine/Russia 
Does the retaking of Kherson in Ukraine signal a turning point in the war, in your opinion, that the Ukrainianswhere the Ukrainians could realistically pursue their ultimate goal of expelling the Russians completely, including retaking Crimea? If so, does the U.S. intend to support and facilitate that goal as you've been doing so far with their other goals? Or would you perhaps see Kherson as a different kind of inflection point, basically a good time to start negotiating now that they've got some more strength than they had, you know, a few weeks ago? Thank you.
The President. First of all, it was a significant, significant victory for Ukraine. A significant victory. And I can do nothing but applaud the courage, determination, and capacity of the Ukrainian people and Ukrainian military. I mean, they have really been amazing.
And I think it's hard to tell at this point exactly what it means in terms ofbut I've been very clear that we're going to continue to provide the capability for the Ukrainian people to defend themselves. And we are not going to engage in any negotiation. There's nonothing about Ukraine without Ukraine. This is a decision Ukraine has to make.
I think you're going to see things slow down a bit because of the winter months and the inability to move as easily around the country. But I think it remains to be seen exactly what the outcome will be, except that I'm confident that Russia will not occupy or defend Ukraine as they intended from the beginning.
Ah, okay, I'm having trouble reading this. Reuters, Natandya [Nandita; White House correction] Bose.
Q. Thank you, Mr. President.
The President. Oh, there you are.
China-North Korea Relations/North Korea/China-U.S. Relations 
Q. A quick question on North Korea, which appears poised to conduct a new nuclear test. I'm wondering if you can talk about your specific discussions with President Xi on that.
To what extent do you think China has the ability to talk North Korea out of conducting such tests? And what are the repercussions for U.S.-Chinese relations if a test goes forward?
The President. Well, first of all, it's difficult to say that I am certain that China can control North Korea, number one.
Number two, I've made it clear to President Xi Jinping that I thought they had an obligation to attempt to make it clear to North Korea that they should not engage in long-range nuclear tests. And I made it clear as well that if they did""they"" meaning North Koreathat we would have to take certain actions that would be more defensive on our behalf, and it would not be directed against North KoreaI mean, excuse meit would not be directed against China, but it would be to send a clear message to North Korea. We are going to defend our allies, as well as American soil and American capacity.
And sobut I do not think thatit's difficult to determine whether or not China has the capacity. I'm confident China is not looking for North Korea to engage in further escalatory means. Because I made it clearand I made it clear from the very beginning, and last year as well, that we will do what it needs to defend our capacity, to defend ourselves and our alliesSouth Korea, as well as Japanand that it would bewe'd be more up in the face of China. But it wouldn't be because of China, it'd be because of what was going on in North Korea.
Soand again, on a number of these issues, we have put together teams where our National Security Adviser, Secretary of Defense, and others are going to be engaging with their counterparts in China to seeand we're not going to be able to work everything out. I'm not suggesting it's goingthis is kumbaya, you know, everybody is going go away with everything in agreement. But I do not believe that there's a need for concern of a, as one of you raised the legitimate question, a new cold war.
And I think thatI'll conclude by saying it this way: I want to be clearand be clear with all leaders, but particularly with Xi Jinpingthat I mean what I say and I say what I mean, so there's no misunderstanding. That's the biggest concern isI have is a misunderstanding about intentions or actions on each of our parts.
So we went in toI'll look at my teamhow long did that meeting last?
Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken. Three and a half hours.
The President. Three and a half hours. So we covered an awful lot of territory. And I must say that he was as straightforward as he has been with me in the past. And I think that we understand one another, which is the most important thing that can be done.
I guess all of you are going swimming from here. It's not far. [Laughter] But
Abortion Rights Legislation 
Q. Mr. President, what should Americans expect from Congress as it relates to abortion rights after the midterms?
The President. I don't think they can expect much of anything other than, we're going to maintain our positions.
I'm not going to get into more questions. I shouldn't even have answered your question.
Q. [Inaudible]codify? You had said you would tryyou would plan to codify.
Q. Mr. President, will you take
The President. No, no, I don't think that
Q. a question from an Indonesian?
The President. I don't think there's enough votes to codify, unless something happens unusual in the House. I think we're going to get very close in the House. But I don'tI think it's going to be very close, but I don't think we're going to make it.
Thank you.

2022-11-14 00:00:00,"Remarks Prior to a Meeting With President Xi Jinping of China in Bali, Indonesia","
President Biden. Well, President Xi, it'sI'm really glad to be able to see you again in person. We've spent a lot of time together andback in the days when we were both Vice Presidents, and it's just great to see you.
And you and I have had a number of candid and useful conversations over the years and since I became President as well. You were kind enough to call me to congratulate me, and I congratulate you as well. And I believe there's little substitute, though, forto face-to-face discussions.
And as you know, I'm committed to keeping the lines of communications open between you and me personally, but our governments across the board, because our two countries arehave so much that we have an opportunity to deal with.
As the leaders of our two nations, we share a responsibility, in my view, to show that China and the United States can manage our differences, prevent competition from becoming anything ever near conflict, and to find ways to work together on urgent global issues that require our mutual cooperation. And I believe this is critical for the sake of our two countries and the international community. This was a key to the theme of the COP27 meeting, where I spoke on Friday. And we'll be discussing a lot of these challenges together, I hope, in the next couple hours.
And the world expects, I believe, China and the United States to play key roles in addressing global challenges, from climate changes, to food insecurity, and tofor us to be able to work together. The United States stands ready to do just thatwork with youif that's what you desire.
So, President Xi, I look forward to our continuing and ongoing, open, and honest dialogue we've always had. And I thank you for the opportunity.
President Xi. Mr. President, it's good to see you. The last time we met was in 2017, during the World Economic Forum in Davos. That was already more than 5 years ago.
Since you assumed the Presidency, we have maintained communication via video conferences, phone calls, and letters. But none of them can really substitute for face-to-face exchanges. And today we finally have this face-to-face meeting.
From the initial contact and the establishment of diplomatic relations to today, China and the United States have gone through 50-plus eventful years. We have gained experience, and we've also learned lessons. History is the best textbook, so we should take history as a mirror and let it guide the future.
Currently, the China-U.S. relationship is in such a situation that we all care a lot about it, because this is not the fundamental interests of our two countries and peoples and it is not what the international community expects us.
As leaders of the two major countries, we need to chart the right course for the China-U.S. relationship. We need to find the right direction for the bilateral relationship going forward and elevate the relationship.
A statesman should think about and know where to lead his country. He should also think about and know how to get along with other countries and the wider world.
Well, in this time and age, great changes are unfolding in ways like never before. Humanity are confronted with unprecedented challenges. The world has come to a crossroads. Where to go from herethis is a question that is not only on our mind, but also on the mind of all countries.
The world expects that China and the United States will properly handle the relationship. And for our meeting, it has attracted the world's attention.

President Widodo. President Biden, welcome to Bali. Welcome to Indonesia.
President Biden. Thank you.
President Widodo. I really appreciate the presence of President Biden at this G-20 summit. And, once again, I really appreciate your presence here. And tomorrow we will discuss and start the G-20 summit. And I hope that the G-20 summit will be able to produce complete cooperation that will help global economic recovery.
President Biden. Well, as I told you, Mr. President, I don't think I'm going home. [Laughter] [Inaudible]you had me staying on the beach. I don't know. [Laughter]
It's great to see you again, Jokowi. This is ayou've been a good friend. And I was happy to welcome you, back in May, at the White House. And I want to thank you for your hospitality and your support at this G-20. You've done a wonderful job thus far.

2022-11-13 00:00:00,"Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Prime Minister Fumio Kishida of Japan and President Yoon Suk Yeol of South Korea in Phnom Penh, Cambodia","
President Biden. Prime Minister Kishida, President Yoon, it's great to see you both again. And, Mr. President, I first want to express our deepest condolences to you and the people of Korea for the tragedy in Seoul 2 weeks ago. We grieve and stand with you and the many families who lost loved ones.
Japan and the Republic of Korea are both critical allies of the United States. And for years, our countries have been engaged in a trilateral cooperation out of the shared concern for the nuclear and missile threats North Korea poses to our people. And North Korea continues provocationprovocative behavior. This partnership is even more important than it's ever been.
We're also deepening our cooperation and collaboration on a range of other challenges. Today we'll discuss how we can strengthen our supply chains and economic resilience, and how we can preserve peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits, and how we can expand our coordinated support for Ukraine, and how we can work toward the common goals of a free and open Indo-Pacific.
And we face real challenges, but our countries are more aligned than ever, more prepared to take on those challenges than ever. So I look forward to deepening the bonds of cooperation between our three countries and thank both of you for your friendship as well as your partnership.
And I yield the floor to Prime Minister Kishida.
Prime Minister Kishida. Again, from myself, President Yoon, I would also like to once again extend my deep condolences to the victims of the painful incident that occurred at Itaewon.
Now, North Korea's provocationsunprecedented both in their frequency and their mannercontinue. And we assume that there could be more coming.
So it is extremely, truly timely that the Japan-U.S.-R.O.K. trilateral summit is being held at such a juncture. And I truly hope that our trilateral cooperation will be cemented further as we counter such challenges resolutely.
Thank you.
President Biden. Thank you. President Yoon.
President Yoon. Following our encounters in New York last September, I am delighted to meet with President Biden and Prime Minister Kishida once again.
In a tragic incident that occurred recently, the lives of two Americans and two Japanese were lost, for which I am deeply saddened and heartbroken. For the victims of the Itaewon incident, you have given us warm words of condolences. And I thank you very much.
This Korea-U.S.-Japan summit is being held again in[inaudible]at a very timely moment indeed. The current developments on the Korean Peninsula and in the region and beyond require the strongest level of our trilateral coordination.
Notably, North Korea, emboldened by its nuclear and missile capabilities, is attempting even more hostile and aggressive provocations. Since I took office in May, North Korea has launched some 50 missiles to date. And from the end of October to early November, its missile-firing was intensive, one of which flew over the eastern part of the Northern Limit Line and landed in our territorial waters. First time this has ever happened since the division of the Peninsula, an extremely serious provocation indeed.
At a time when South Koreans are grieving in deep sorrow, North Korea pushed ahead with itswith such provocations, which lays bare the Kim Jong Un regime's true inclinations that completely go against humanitarianism and humanism.
In safeguarding universal values and attaining peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and in Northeast Asia, our trilateral coordination remains a strong bulwark. Through this meeting today, I hope we will step up cooperation among our three nations.
Thank you.
President Biden. Well, the trilateral cooperation is extreme, it's extensive, and it's real. And it's not going toit's going to be sustained.
[At this point, President Biden addressed reporters.]
And if you all can leave without hurting one another, it'd be a nice thing to see.

It's wonderful that we can gather with all of you again. This is my third U.S.-ASEAN summit of my Presidency. And I was honored to host the White Houseat the White House in May. And now that we are back together here in Cambodia, I look forward to building even stronger progress than we've already made.
And I want to thank the Prime Minister offor Colombia's [Cambodia's; White House correction] leadership in the ASEANas ASEAN chair and for hosting all of us.
And also, I want to recognize that we're going to be inall the work that Indonesia has done this year. Mr. President, thank you very much andas the country coordinatorcoordinator for the United States.
And in fact, this is, as I said, my third tripmy third summitsecond in person. And it's testament to the importance the United States places on our relationship with ASEAN and our commitment to ASEAN's centrality. ASEAN is the heart of my administration's Indo-Pacific strategy, and we continue to strengthen our commitment to work in lockstep with an empowered, unified ASEAN.
Today we take another critical step: beginning a new era in our cooperation with the launch of the U.S.-ASEAN Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. Together, we will tackle the biggest issues of our time, from climate to health security; defend against the significant threats of rule-based orderto rule-based order and to thethreats to the rule of law; and to build an Indo-Pacific that's free and open, stable and prosperous, resilient and secure.
And we're putting real resources behind our approach, not just rhetoric. Over the last year, my administration has announced more than $250 million in new initiatives with ASEAN. And for 2023, I've requested $850 million [$825 million; White House correction] in assistance for Southeast Asia. We're continuing to build on that progress, following through on our commitments and launching concrete new initiatives that further strengthen ASEAN and increaseincreaseconnectivity across Southeast Asia.
Thoughthrough our new U.S.-ASEAN Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Initiative, we're going to work together to develop an integrated, electric vehicle ecosystem in Southeast Asia, enabling the region to pursue clean energy, economic development, and ambitious emissions reductions targets. Similarly, we're launching a U.S.-ASEAN Platform for Infrastructure and Connectivity to bring the benefits of the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment to the ASEAN countries.
Through this platform, we'll develop projects together, based on the needs you identify, to create sustainable, high-standard infrastructure that supports the people of the region. We will build a better futurethe better future we all say we want to see and we're going to see for all, butall 1 billion people in our countries.
We'll also discuss Russia's brutal war against Ukraine and our efforts to address the war's global impacts, including in Southeast Asia.
So I look forwardI look forward to continuing our work together with the ASEAN and with each one of you to deepen peace and prosperity throughout the region, to resolve challenges from the South China Sea to Myanmar, and to find innovative new solutions to shared challenges.
Thank you again for the 45 years of partnership between ASEAN and the United States and for all that we can accomplish together. Thank you.

Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Friends, partners, Speaker Pelosi, Members of Congress who have traveled here to represent the United States, and fellow leaders: It's an honor to once again participate in this critical summit.
And I'd like to thank our host, President Sisi, for bringing us together at this pivotal moment. Thank you, Mr. President.
Let me start by acknowledging that this day is a day of commemoration at home, in the United States. It's Veterans Day. America's veterans and their families, survivors, and caregivers arethey're a spine and soul of the United States. And on this special day, on every day, I honor all of those who have sacrificed for our Nation, like my son.
I want to thank one proud American veteran, a life-long public servant and dear friend, and, literally, one of the most decorated men to fight, Special Envoy for Climate, John Kerry. John. John, your commitment, your passion, your diplomatic expertise have been absolutely criticalabsolutely criticalto delivering incredible progress on climate issues over the past 2 years. And I thank you, pal. I thank you for being my friend.
Here in Egypt, the Great Pyramids and the ancient artifacts stand as testament to millennia of human ingenuity. We see our mission to avert climate catastrophe and seize a new clean energy economy not only as an imperative for our present and future, but through the eyes of history.
According to the World Meteorological Organization, the past 8 years have been the warmest on record. The United Statesin the United States, we're seeing historic drought and wildfires in the West, devastating hurricanes and storms in the East.
Here in Africa, home to many nations considered most vulnerable to climate change, food insecurity [and; White House correction] hunger follows 4 years of intense drought in the Horn of Africa. Meanwhile, the Niger River in West Africa, swollen because of more intense rainfall, is wreaking havoc on fishing and farming communities. In Nigeria, flooding has recently killed 600 people; 1.3 million more are displaced. Seasonal livestock migration routes have been used for hundreds of years are being altered, increasing the risk of conflict between herders and local farming communities.
The climate crisis is about human security, economic security, environmental security, national security, and the very life of the planet. So today I'd like to share with you how the United States is meeting the climate crisis with urgency and with determination to ensure a cleaner, safer, and healthier planet for all of us.
From my first days in office, my administration has led with a bold agenda to address the climate crisis and increase energy security at home and around the world. We immediately rejoined the Paris Agreement. We convened major climate summits and reestablished[applause]I apologize, we ever pulled out of the agreementwe established Major EconomicsMajor Economies Forum to spur countries around the world to raiseraisetheir climate ambitions.
Last year, at COP26 in Glasgow, the United States helped deliver critical commitments that will get two-thirds of the world's GDP on track to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.
Over the past 2 years, the United States has delivered unprecedented progress at home. Through a generational investment in upgrading our Nation's infrastructure, we're making our power grid better able to transmit clean energy, expanding public traffictransit and rail, building a nationwide network of electric vehicle charging stationsover 50,000.
And this summer, the United States Congress passed and I signed into law my proposal for the biggest, most important climate bill in the history of our country, the Inflation Reduction Act.
It includes less than I asked for, but a significant amount$368 billionto support clean electricclean electricity, everything from onshoreoffshore wind to distributed solar, zero-emission vehicles, and sustainable aviation fuels; more efficient electrified buildings; cleaner industrial processes and manufacturing; climate-smart agriculture and forestry; and more.
Look, our Department of Energy estimates that the new law will reduce emissions in the United States by about 1 billion tons in 2030 while unleashing a new era of clean energy-powered economic growth. Our investments in technology, from electric batteries to hydrogen, are going to spark a cycle of innovation that will reduce the cost and improve the performance of clean energy technology that will be available to nations worldwide, not just the United States.
We're going to helpit will help make the transition to a low-carbon future more affordable for everyone, accelerate decarbonation beyond our borders. In fact, the International Energy Agency recently concluded that our significant climate investment will, quote, help turbo-charge theexcuse me, ""turbo-charge the emerging global clean energy economy."" I was reading their quote, sorry. [Laughter] It's going to shift the paradigm for the United States and the entire world.
Itwe also ratified the Kigali Amendment to rally the world in phasing down the production and consumption of HFCs, greenhouse gasesthat are thousands of times more damaging than carbon dioxide. And just yesterday the United States became the first Government to require that our Federalmajor Federal suppliers disclose their emissions and climate risks and set targets for themselves that are aligned with the Paris Agreement.
As the world's largest customer, with more than $650 billion [$630 billion; White House correction] in spending last year, the United States Government is putting our money where our mouth is to strengthen accountability for climate risk and resilience.
These critical steps are already locking in vital investments in our infrastructure, delivering lower cost for clean energy, spurring good-paying union jobs for American workers, and advancing environmental justice in our communities.
Folks, we are proving that good climate policy is good economic policy. It's a strong foundation for durable, resilient, inclusive economic growth. It's driving progress in the private sector. It's driving progress around the world.
And the sum total of the actions my administration is taking puts the United States on track to achieve our Paris Agreement goal of reducing emissions 50 to 52 percent below '25 levels by2005 levels by 2030.
Let me just take a moment to emphasize how meaningful it is that I can say that. I introduced the first piece of climate legislation in the United States Senate way back in 1986, 36 years ago. My commitment to this issue has been unwavering.
Today, finally, thanks to the actions we've taken, I can stand here as President of the United States of America and say with confidence: The United States of America will meet our emissions targets by 2030.
We are racing forward to do our part to avert the ""climate hell"" that the U.N. Secretary-General so passionately warned about earlier this week. We're not ignoring harbingers that are already here.
It's true: so many disastersthe climate crisis is hitting hardest those countries and communities that have the fewest resources to respond and to recover. That's why, last year, I committed to work with our Congress to quadruple U.S. support to climate finance and provide $11 billion annually by 2024, including $3 billion for adaption [adaptation; White House correction].
And that's why the fundthe Emergency Plan for Adaptation and ResiliencePREPARE, we call itto help more than half a billion people in developing countries respond to climate change. We'realready requested more than $2 billion for the PREPARE this year. I am going to fight to see that this and our other climate objectives are fully funded.
Today, as a downpayment, we're announcing more than $150 million in initiatives that specifically support PREPARE's adaptation efforts throughout Africa, including Adaptation in Africa effort that Egypt and the United States launched together in June.
This includes support for expanding early warning systems to help cover Africa, broadening access to climate finance, providing disaster-risk protection, strengthening food security, mobilizing the private sector, and supporting a new training center in Egypt to accelerate adaptation across the efforts all across the continent.
My administration has also made the United States the first-ever contributor to the Adaptation Fund last year, and this year we're doubling our pledge to bringing our total commitment to a hundred million dollars. We're making sure that every dollar we deliver goes as far as possible, unlikingunlocking larger pools of finance and the trillions in private investment we know that will be needed.
Folks, we're also supporting the Global Shield, a G-7 initiative to better protect vulnerable countries everywhere from climate-related losses and quickly respond to climate-related damages. And the G-7-led Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment is working to meet the critical infrastructure needs in low- and middle-income countries with specific focus on climate.
The project we're facilitating is built on transparency, partnership, the protections for workers and the environment. One of the many projects already underway is a partnership between American firms and the Government of Angola to invest $2 billion building new solar projects in Angola.
And everywhereand like everywhere in the world, climate adaptation in Africa is working toward an energy transition that is just. It means creating good jobs, spurring inclusive economic growth, and leaving no one behind as we implement the sustainable development goals.
Folks, now I know this has been a difficult few years. The interconnected challenges we face can feel all-consuming. And the upheaval we're seeing around the world, especially Russia's brutal attack against Ukraine, is exacerbating food shortages and energy spikes in cost, increasing volatility in those energy markets, driving up global inflation.
Against this backdrop, it's more urgent than ever that we double down on our climate commitments. Russia's war only enhances the urgency of the need to transition the world off its dependence on fossil fuels.
True energy security means every nationit means that every nation is benefiting from clean, diversified energy future. No actionno actioncan be taken without a nation understanding that it can use energy as a weapon and hold the global economy hostage. It must stop.
And so this gathering must be the moment to recommit our future and to our shared capacity to write a better story for the world. Let's build on our global climate progress, raising above our ambitions and the speed of our efforts. The science is devastatingly clear. We have to make vital progress by the end of this decade. And that's why the United States is rallying the world around climate game changers.
I launched one such game changer last year with the European Commission President von der Leyen: the Global Methane Pledge. We started it with the EU and eight other countries. In Glasgow, it grew to more than 100 countries. Now more than 130 countries have signed on to covering more than half of the global methane emissions.
Methane is 80 times more potent than carbon, and it accounts for nearly halfhalfof the net warming we're experiencing now. So cutting methane by at least 30 percent by 2030 can be our best chance to keep within the reach of 1.5 degrees Celsius target.
And today we're releasing an updated Methane Emissions Reduction Act Plan, which lays out how the United States is meeting the pledge. We're investing more than $20 billion in domestic methane mitigation to do things like cap orphan wells leaking methane, improving industrial equipment in the oil and gas sectors to reduce emissions.
It also lays out strong regulatory actions, includingincludinga new proposal from our Environmental Protection Agency to strengthen standards on methane across sectors, especially from superemitters, to makejust to make sure it's not released into communities, impacting on public health.
All told, these steps[applause]. All told, these steps will reduce U.S. methane emissions from covered sources by 87 percent below the levels of 2005 by 2030.
Folks, another game changer is conserving our natural environment. Whether it's the Congo Basin forests and peatlands here in Africa or the Amazon Basin in South America, or forests, wetlands, and grasslands in the United States, preserving nature is one of the most impactful climate solutions we havesome that Indigenous people, who havecommunities have known and been the stewards of these efforts for a long time and generations. They've known it.
Here at COP27, we are cochairing Forests and Climate Partnership to deliver real, rapid strides to halt deforestation. The best part is, we don't have to develop any new technologies. We just have to make clear: Forests are more valuable when they're preserved than when they're destroyed. It's that basic. And those who are able should be chipping in to help those countries that, in fact, preserve those great forests.
We're bringing together partners across the public and private sector and philanthropic sectors to put healthhealthy ecosystem at the heart of healthy economies.
This isit's going to take all of us. It's going to take all of us.
We need to harness our capacity to tackle emissions in economic sectors like international shipping. If the shipping sector were a standalone economyif it were a standalone economyit would rank as the tenth largest [among the ten largest; White House correction] emitter in the world.
So, together with Norway, the United States has launched the Green Shipping Challenge. During this COP, we've seen dozens of commitments from governments, as well as ports and private companies, to facilitate green shipping corridors and align the sector with the 1.5-degree goal.
If we can accelerate action on these game changers, we can reach our goal; we can keep it within reach as well. But to permanently bend the emissions curve, every nation hasneeds to step up. At this gathering, we must renew and raise our climate ambitions. The United States is acting. Everyone has to act. It's the duty and responsibility of global leadership.
Countries that are in a position to help should be supporting developing countries so they can make decisive climate decisions, facilitating their energy transitions, building a path to prosperity and compatible with our climate imperative. If countries can finance coal in developing countries, there is no reason why we can't finance clean energy in developing companies [countries; White House correction].
And I'm pleased to announce today, alongside the European Union and Germany, a $500 million package to finance and facilitate Egypt's transition to clean energy. This package will enable Egypt to deploy 10 gigawatts of renewable energy by 2030, while bringing off line 5 gigawatts of inefficient, gas-powered facilities, reducing emissions in Egypt and power sector by 10 percent.
We alsowe'll also work with Egypt to capture nearly 14 billion [4 billion; White House correction] cubic meters of natural gas, which Egypt currently flares, vents, or leaks from its oil and gas operations. And because of this cooperation, Egypt is elevating its climate ambition and submitting an enhanced national determination contribution.
If we're going to win this fight, every major emitter nation needs to align with the 1.5 degrees. We can no longer plead ignorance to the consequences of our actions or continue to repeat our mistakes. Everyone has to keep accelerating our efforts throughout this decisive decade.
My friends, I came to the Presidency determined to bemake thetransformational changes that are neededthat America needs to make and we have to do for the rest of the world to overcome decades of opposition and obstacles of progress on this issue alone; to reestablish the United States as a trustworthy, committed, global leader on climate.
As I stand here before you, we've taken enormous strides to achieve that.
[At this point, there was a disruption in the audience.]
But I don't stand here alone. This progress is being driven by young people all across America. Like young people around the world, they feel the urgency of climate, and they feel it deeply. They're committed to these issues. They know the stakes, and that's their world we're creating.
This is not to stand by and allow us to fail in theirin this responsibility. We can't. That's why, as I look out, of all the things that I'vewe've accomplished, with so much more to do, I'm optimistic.
For all the work that remains to be done, we have to put down significant markers of progress. The United States has taken enduring steps to meet our goals. We're delivering on our promise of leadership, and more and more of the world is standing with us.
Though determined diplomacy is necessary, we're finding consensus, building and understanding and launching new approaches. And the inspiring passion of young people, civil society, climate activists, Indigenous communities is literally galvanizing the world.
Yes, the challenges we face are great, but our capacity is greater than the challenges. We must never doubt that. So let's reach out and take the future in our hands and make the world we wish to see and that we know we need: a planet preserved for generations to come; an economy powered by clean, diversified, secure energy sources; opportunities unlocked through innovation and cooperation that deliver equitable, more prosperous, and more stable, and more just world for our children.
That's why we're here. That is what we're working toward. And we can do it together. I am confident.
Thank you, thank you, thank you. And may God bless you all.

2022-10-14 00:00:00,"Remarks at an Oregon State Democratic Party Grassroots Organizers Event in Portland, Oregon","
[The President entered the room carrying a box of doughnuts.]
The President. Hello, Oregon! I assume you're clapping for the doughnuts. Which table?
Thank you for what you're doing. No, I really mean it. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
I've been aroundI know I don't look it, but I've been around a long time. [Laughter] And this is, I think, the most important off-year election that we've had insince Roosevelt's timeI mean that sincerelybecause so much is at stake. If we are able to keep the House and keep the Senate, we can continue to do the things we've been doing, which are really going to makechange the country.
We're at a real inflection point in this country. What happens in the next 4 to 6 years is going to determine what happens for the next three or four generations. Not a joke. It's not just America, but it's across the world that's happening the same way.
And sobut I'm here because Ron Wyden has been such an incredible chairman. [Applause] No, I'm not joking.
You know, when I was running for officeand thank you; some of you who helped me here. Gosh, it was nice winning by 16 points. God Almighty. [Laughter] This is the only State he didn't contest.
But all kidding aside, whatwe ran on the notion that, you know, Big Pharma continued to abuse the Americanwe pay more for drugs than any country in the world. I mean, the same exact drug, the same exact prescription sold here, sold Canada, sold in Germany, sold in South Africa is significantly cheaper than here.
And so we've triedtrying to take on Big Pharma for a long time. And we got two things going for us this time. One, American labor, which was 100 percent bySEIU, I love you. But the other one was Ron. You know, you may remindmy talking about how, you know, 5553 American corporations made 400$40 billion, didn't pay a single penny in taxes, and we couldn't get anything moving. Ron got it done. [Applause] No, Ron got it.
And one of the things thatthe reason why it's so important we win this off-year electionbecause a lot of what we've done doesn't kick in until January, so people don't even know it yet. For example, no seniorbecause of these two guys right hereno senior in America on Medicaid will have to pay more than $2,000 a year for their prescriptions, no matter how much they cost. [Applause] No, really.
That isby the way, that's a staggering note. Because some of these cancer drugs are 13-, 14,000 bucks a year. I'm telling you, I had a sonanyway. Ibut you know, it's expensive. And imagine all those folks who don't have the capacity beyond Medicare to pay for what they have, what they need.
Thirdly, you know, it costyou knowyou don't have to say whether you do. Do you know anybody who needs insulin for diabetes?
Audience member. Yes.
Audience member. Yes.
The President. Okay, well, guess what? Because of these guys and the Congresspeople thatwhere are all my Congress friends? They're[applause].
But this is really important. You know how much it makesit costs to make one vial of insulin? Ten dollars. T-E-N.
By the way, it's her birthday today.
[At this point, the President put his arm around Rep. Suzanne M. Bonamici.]
Rep. Bonamici. It's a birthday I'll never forget.
The President. And by the way, she isjust turned 30. So it's[laughter]it's abut all kidding aside, it costs 10 bucks$10$10 to make that vial and package it. And people are chargingthey're charging 30, 40 times that amount, monthly cost.
So guess what? Because of your congressional delegation, no one has to pay more than $35 for a prescription. Nobody.
That's aby the way, just imagineI was telling my colleagues in the SenateI still think of myself as a Senator; I was there for 36 years. [Laughter] But I was telling them that I was down in Virginia at a town hall. This woman stood up and was very emotional. She had her two daughters. She said: ""Both of my daughters have diabetes, and I can't afford the insulin. I can't afford it. I can't afford it.""
Imagine being a parent and have your dignity stripped of you when your child you know needs it to stay healthy and maybe alive, and you can't do a damn thing about. But your guys here changed that for people. You changed that.
And there's a little thing called the environment. When I introduced that bill called Build Back Better, everybody went ""Oh, no one's going to do that.""
[The President intentionally grumbled into the microphone.]
[Laughter] Well, Oregon saved me. Because what did you do? You stepped up and you made surewe have little things called ""tax credits"" that will fundamentally change people's lives. Ordinary middle class folks are going to be in a position because of folks like this one here.
[The President clasped hands and stood with Oregon Democratic gubernatorial candidate Tina Kotek, who waved to the audience.]
No, I'm[applause]because guess what? What a Governor does matters. It matters. It matters, it matters, it matters.
And it does.
Ms. Kotek. [Inaudible]
The President. And look, folksanyway, I'm taking too much of your time; you should be on the telephones. [Laughter] But all kidding aside, there's so much that, if we get by this election, we can changewe can begin to change the world.
I know, you know, I'm a little bit of a cockeyed optimist. I realize that. But the truth of the matter is, I've never been more optimistic about America's prospects. I really mean it, from the bottom my heart. Never, never, never, never. And there's two reasons for it.
Because of thesewe're the only country in the world that hasonly countrythat has come out of crises stronger than we went in. Not just returned to where we werestronger than we went in.
There's so much. We've done an infrastructure bill. So much we've done infor example, dealing with burn pits, the veterans. All these poor sons of guns who lived next to these burn pits, which are football-sized, 8 to 10, 12 feet deep, burning everything from fuel to human waste toI mean, it justand a lot of them died.
More people came back with cancer than any war in American history. More people exposed to these toxicbut guess what? We'vebecause of what these guys did, we were able to pass that burn pits legislation. And nowand nowthose who lost someonelost someonetheir families are being compensated by helping theirthe kids' educations, by helping with monthly payments, and so on. It's a big deal. It's a big deal.
And those who are still alive are getting treatment that they don't have to prove their illness was because of the burn pits.
And so, anywayand the reason I'm excitedand I'm going to stopI know, I can see the looks on your faces here[laughter]because we've got to get back to work.
But here's the dealI know, don't worry.
Audience member. They're on me.
The President. I know they are.
Audience member. And it's your fault. [Laughter]
The President. I know. But here's the deal: The reason I'm basically optimistic about America is because of those folks between 18 and 35 years old. It's the most educated generation in American history, the most open generation, the least prejudiced generation, the mostI'm being literalmost volunteering generation in all of American history.
There's nothingnothing, nothing, nothingthat America can't do if we set our mind to it. I've spent more time with Xi Jinping of China than any world leader has, when I was Vice President all the way through to now. Over 78 hours with him alone, 8, 9 of those hours on the phone and the others in person, traveling 17,000 miles with him around the world, in China and the United States.
And here's the deal: He asked me, when I was inwhenin the Tibetan Plateau. We each had an interpretersimultaneous interpreter. He said, ""Can you define America for me?"" I said: ""Yes, one word. One word: possibilities."" There's nothing beyond our capacity. Nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing. So let's get this election underway, and let's finish the job.
God love you all. Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. And let's have some doughnuts!

2022-10-14 00:00:00,"Remarks on Efforts To Reduce Prescription Drug Costs in Irvine, California","
The President. Well, thank you. Well, I'mgreat to be here in Orange County, at Irvine Valley College. And, Susan, thank you for that introduction. Please sit downpleasethank youif you have a seat. [Laughter]
Audience member. Love you, Joe!
The President. And Iwell, thank you so much.
Look, unfortunately, the story Susan told is not unique. And it'syou know many, many families that are going through this.
Situation in Iran 
But before I beginthe point of my discussion today, I knowI look over there, and I see ""Free Iran."" And I want you to know we stand with the citizens and brave women of Iran, for realfor real and who right now are demonstrating to secure their very basic, fundamental rights.
Women and men should have the rightthe rightto freedom of expression and assembly. And womenwomen all over the worldare being persecuted in various ways. But they should be able to wear, in God's name, what they want to wear. No one should be telling them what to wear.
And Iran has to end the violence against its own citizens simply exercising their fundamental rights. And you know, Masha [Mahsa]* Amini's death wasI've been indoing foreign policy a long, long time. It stunned me what it awakened in Iran. And it's awakened something that I don't think will be quieted in a long, long time.
And so I want to thank you all for speaking out. I want to thank the Persian community here for being so vocal. And continue. It matters.
Audience member. Protect my freedom!
The President. That's one thing you don't have to tell me. [Laughter] You met my wife? [Laughter] I married up.
I was one of those guys that, my whole life, I've been surrounded by women who've taken care of me, maybe they're smarter than I am. My younger sister used to be 3 years younger than me. Now she's 23 years younger. [Laughter] There was not a single, solitary Biden man that is as oldyounger than any Biden woman.
And my wife, by the waywe're at a community collegemy wife is teaching today. My wife is a fulltime college professor at a community college.
Prescription Drug Costs 
And look, I'm here today because I want to share the progress we're making to bring down the costhealth care costs for everybody. And thanks to the Democrats in Congress, like Lou and also Katieand Katie isyou know, Katie has just been a star. You can tell she's not passionate about much. [Laughter] And you can tell she's a retiring soul.
But all kidding aside, you know, a policy whiz who knows how to talk to folks, a fighter who's taken on the powerful special interests. And we've seen it all. No drug company executive wants to testify in Congress before Katie. Nobody wants to do that becauseto answer her questionsbecause they're to the point and they're revealing.
Katie's bigis a big reason why I've been able to make such progress dealing with health care. And that's what I want to talk to you a little bit about today.
You know, I know it's been a tough 4 or 5 years for the country. We've made a lot of progress, but, folks, we stilla lot of folks are still struggling, folks that came from the families I came from, where they sit around the kitchen table at the end of the month and wonder: ""How in God's name are we going to pay for everything? Do we have enough?""
Well, you know, I think about it the way my dad did. He used to talk about it in a way that so many of you at home still talk about it around that kitchen table or that dinner table: ""How much are the monthly bills? And how are we going to have to pay for all the necessities that extend beyond that? Is there enough left over?"" My dad used to use the phrase ""for just a little bit of breathing room.""
My dad was a well-read, high school-educated guy whose great regret whatwas he never got to go to school. And he used to talk about: Everyoneeveryoneis entitled to be treated with dignity. And when you don't have the capacity to meet the basic needs of your children and your family, you're deprived of your dignity. You're deprived of your dignity.
It's especially the case when it comes to health care and prescription drug costs. That's why Katie's leadership and the work of the Democrats in Congress is so consequential. And, Katie, I'm not just being nice because I'm in your district; it happens to be true. [Laughter] No, no, I mean it.
You are a fighter, you're decent, you're honorable, and everybody respects you. Everybody respects you. And it's a big deal, because you get a lot done. You get a lot done.
You know, I wrote and then signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act. They used to call itand the press has topoor people have to follow me all over the countryand they've heard me say it before. It used to be called ""Build Back Better."" Andbut we got almost all of it.
That Inflation Reduction Act did a lot of things. It had, like, just a short amount of money$368 billionfor the climate, which isit did a whole range of things. But what it did was, it took on special interests in a way that we haven't in a long time. I know I don't look it, but I've been around for a while. [Laughter] And it's one of the most significant laws in our history when it comes to helping families pay their bills at the end of the month.
Look, take the prescription drug cost. We pay more for prescription drugs than any [advanced]* nation in the world for the samenot drugs genericallythe same exact drug. The cost of that drug by the same company sold in France and the United States is sometimes 25-percent cheaperor Canada or any other place I can name for you.
And there's no reason for it, because Big Pharma has been just a dominant force. Katie laid out the numbers that they expended.
For years, many of us have been trying to fix that problem. Why is that, for example, they canthe VA can negotiate drug prices forwith Pharma? ""We're not going to pay you more than a, b, c, or d, or x amount for the""the only exemption written into the law was that MedicareMedicarecould not negotiate the price of a drug with the drug companies, where they make billions of dollars through Medicare.
For years, Big Pharma stood in the way. And for years, there's been no check on how high or fast Pharma could raise drug prices.
When I ran for this office, I ran on this platform. It's just not right.
This year, drug companies alone raised the price of more than 1,200 drugsthis year, this calendar yearraised the price on 1,200 drugs above the rate of inflation. Not a single additional bit of information was injected into that drug. Not any more experimentation. Nothing new. Same exact drug. Same drug. And it gets increased1,200 of them1,200. The average price increase for those drugs was over 30 percent30 percent.
In 2022, the price for one blood pressure drug that millions of Medicare beneficiaries rely on increased by over 500 percent. Who, in God's name, do they think they are? They thought they were impervious. They had so much power.
You think I'm joking. I've beenwe've been tryinga guy like me who has been around the Senate a long time been trying to take them on forever. And they're powerful, and people were afraid to take them on.
Another drug used to treat autoimmune conditions increased just this year by $1,000by $1,000. This is outrageous.
But this year, the American people won. We took on Big Pharma, and we beat them finally. We beat them finally.
Now, if Big Pharma tries to raise drug prices faster than inflation, they're going to have to write a check to Medicare forto cover the difference. Now, instead of that money going into the pockets of drug companies, it's going to go into the pockets in the form of lower drug prices in America.
There's more money at the end of the month to pay for groceries, to get your car repaired, to buy your grandson a birthday presentwhatever it is. The Inflation Reduction Act gives Medicare the power to negotiate lower prescription drug prices. And seniorsseniors will see their out-of-pocket costs for drugs capped at $2,000 a year. If you're on Medicare, you cannot be charged more than $2,000 a year no matter what drugs you get. I'm serious. It's a gigantic changea gigantic change.
My mother had the fortune of having successfulmy two successful brothers and a sister. I was kind of the guy out, but anyway. [Laughter] But my mom lived with me after my dad died. And she used to sneak up to the drugstore to get her prescriptions because she didn't want us to know she didn't have enough money to pay for it. She wouldn't tell us.
NotI'm not joking. I'm not joking. She didn't want anybody to know she did not have the money to pay for it. So finally, I went up, and I made sure that whatever she had in her wallet, that's what the drugstore charged her, because I gave them whatever they need. They had a card.
My generic point is: Think of all the mothers and fathers out therelike your mom wasall of them. Their pride is in thestake at well. These are the same people who taught us to ""stand up, don't complain, never explain"" in my house.
Well, folks, whether it's expensive drugs, another drug they need to survive, we're talking about drugs that cost $9-, $10-, and $14,000 a year, particularly cancer drugs.
The Inflation Reduction Act caps that costit caps the cost of insulin.
How many of you know of someone and maybemany of you that need that insulin for diabetes? Well, go aheadyou know how much it costs for them to make that insulin and package it? TenT-E-Ndollars. Ten dollars total. They're chargingthey're charging up to $400 to $1,000, depending on where you live, for that drug.
I was in Virginia about 4 or 5 months ago and doing a town hall, and a woman stood up, and she started to cry. She said: ""My two kids have diabetes, and we have to cut the pills in half. We have to share the insulin."" I shouldexcuse me. ""We have to share it."" Saidimagine being a parent not having enough insurance, not being able to afford it, and looking at your son or daughter and knowing if they don't get that insulin, they could literally permanently be scarred and/or die. What the hell does that do to people? What's it do?
Folks, the Inflation Reduction Act caps the cost of insulin at 35 bucks a month, instead of $400 a month. Now, what Katie didn't tell you, she got, in the House, passedit applied to everyone, not just to Medicare patients. Well, the Senate, they kicked outthey kicked outcoverage for non-Medicare patients. So there's 200,000 kids out there that you have to pay a hell of a lot for their diabetes insulin.
Folks, look, as I said, it costs $10 to make. The drug companies charge more than 30 times that. And as I said, imagine being that parent and not having the money. What do you do? What do you do? Just imagine.
Well, you're going to keep fighting for lower drug costs, saving insulin for children and families as well. Because if we keep the House and Senate this time, we are going to make sure it applies to everybody in the country. Guaranteed.
Because of the Inflation Reduction Act, seniors on Part D Medicare will also be able to get their recommended vaccines, like shingles vaccines, for free, no copay.
And tomorrow will mark the beginning of Medicaid's open enrollment period. So, when seniors pick plans for next year, they'll be able to take advantage of the progress we've made.
But that's not all. For years, the fee you pay for Medicare to cover your visits to your doctor's office have gone up. Now, for the first time in more than a decade, the fees are going to go down.
And yesterday we announced that Social Security benefits are going to be going up an average of $140 a month starting next month. And, folks, look, seniors are going to get ahead of inflation next year. For the first time in 10 years, their Social Security checks are going to go up while Medicare premiums go down. And this is a big deal for seniors.
And this morning I issued an Executive order directing the Department of Health and Human Services, within 90 days, to put a plan on my desk finding an additional way to lower prescription drug costs for seniors, because there's other ways we can do this in addition.
But we're not just focused on seniors. Earlier this week, the Treasury Department took action to fix the problem that was making it harder for families to afford health care coverage for their spouse or a child, a so-called ""family glitch"" rule. It's a glitch all right.
Under the old rules, a working mom was told as long as she could afford employer-based coverage for herself, she couldn't qualify for premium subsidies to afford coverage for her family. Well, now, 1 million people will gain coverage and [or]* pay lower premiums.
Last year, a family of four with a health coverage through the Affordable Care Act saved $2,400 from the American Rescue Plan that I signed into law. Now, Inflation Production [Reduction]* Act is going to lock that in place for lower health care premiums for millions of families.
Folksand by the way, the drug companies are going to continue to do very well in terms of profit. We're not costing them anything other than they should get cost.
But, folks, let me tell you something: Every single Democratas, in fact, Katie spoke aboutevery single one voted for Inflation Reduction Act. Not a single, solitary Republican in both the House of Representatives and the United States Senate voted for it. Every single one voted against it. Every single one.
Not only that, now congressional Republicans are telling us their number-one priority is to repealif they win back the House and Senaterepeal the Inflation Reduction Act. That includes things that I'm not even talking about today, including the environment.
But let's be crystal clear of what that means. If Republicans in Congress have their way, it's going to mean the power we just gave Medicare to negotiate lower prescription drug prices and other costs over time goes awaygone. The $2,000 cap on prescription drugs goes awaygone. The $35-a-month cap on insulin for Medicare is gone. Savings from health care premiums got just forwe just got for millions of Americansgone.
And of course, it's not the Inflation Reduction Act they want to get rid of. They're still determined to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. Youwhat people don't realizethey didn't realize the Affordable Care Act is the only basis upon which people with a preexisting condition can get health care, unless you can afford an expensive policy. If Republicans have their way, that's gone as well.
And here's the bottom line, so please hear this: When it actually comes time to do something about inflation around the kitchen table, Republicans in Congress are saying, ""No."" If Republicans take control, the prices are going to go up, as will inflation. It's this simple.
Sadly, they go even further. Already, a vast majority of the House Republicans have signed on to a Republican budget that's going to cutand hear me nowcut Medicare and Social Security. Cut it.
Rick Scott, the Senator from Florida, he's the head of the program to elect Republican Senators. He has proposed a plan to put Social Security and Medicare on the chopping block every 5 years. If you don't vote for it again, it goes away. That means every 5 years, Congress will vote to cut, reduce, or completely eliminate Social Security and Medicare.
And then there's Ron Johnson, the Senator from Wisconsin. He thinks every 4 yearsthis is the God's truthI don'tdo we have the pamphlets out here? Thatthey'rethere are pamphlets. Take a look at it. Their words, not mine.
He thinks every 5 years is too long to wait, so he wants Social Security and Medicare to be on the chopping block every single, solitary year. If Congress doesn't vote to keep it, it goes away. It goes away. Not just Social Security and Medicare, he wants to put veterans benefits and everything else in the Federal budget at risk.
Folks, let me close with this. Over the last few years, we've faced some of the most difficult challenges in our history, but we're making real progress. We've got a long way to go, but we're making real progress helping folks get a little more breathing room.
Despite the opposition from some of the most powerful special interests in the Nation, we're lowering health care costs and strengthening Medicare. And we're fighting for folks who need our help. It's one of the reasons why I'm so optimistic about America's future.
We just have to remember who in God's name we are. This is the United States of America. No, not a joke. Look, there's not ever been a damn thing we can't do when we've set our mind to it. Name me something we've ever tried toyou're smiling, but name me one. [Laughter] Name me one thing we've ever tried to accomplish that when we did it together, we haven't been able to do it. There's nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing beyond our capacity. And that's the God's truth. Think about it.
And the American public, over the last 5 years, has begun to lose hope that it's within our power to do almost anything, but we really can. But we've got to stick together.
And I don't care whether you're a Democrat or Republican or an Independent. The idea that people can charge 30, 40, 50, 60 times what it costs to make a drug, it just makes no sense when there's no alternative. It's not like you raise the price on a Chevy 10 times, and you still can't go buy a Ford. I'm not joking. Where there's no options.
So, folks, I want to thank Katie for her incredible work. And I mean it. She is incredible at what she does. I mean it, Katie.
And I want to say to all of you, God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you.

2022-10-13 00:00:00,"Remarks at a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Reception in Los Angeles, California","
The President. Nancy, thank you. Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Please. Please. Thank you very, very much. I'm going home. [Laughter]
Well, Nancy, thank you so much. I don't want this to turn into a mutual admiration society, but the truth of the matter is: Not a single thing we got done in the administration, not a single thing of all the things that Nancy mentioned would have gotten done without her leadership in the House and the Senateand the Senate.
And as my colleagues in the House and Senate who are here can tell you, I have ano one ever doubts I mean what I say. The problem is, I sometimes say all that I mean. [Laughter]
But I really mean this. I've only been around 50 years. [Laughter] I got elected to the Senate when I was 29 years old. And I can tell you, I've been with a lot of Speakers, a lot of leaders in the House and Senate. And it's not hyperbole: Nancy is the single best Speaker, I think, in American history.
And my inclination is, when she asks you for something, just say yes. It's a hell of a lot easier. [Laughter] Oh, you think I'm kidding. Paul can tell you. [Laughter] Paul can tell you.
But look, folks, you know, the truth of the matter isand many of you heard me say this before, especially my colleagues in the House and Senatethat I think America is really at one of those moments. We're at a real inflection point in historynot just American history, but in history.
The world is changing. It's changing rapidly. And it's beyond the control, and it's not because of any one single individual or one nation at all. You know, the Organization of American Stateslook what's happening there. Look what's happening around the world in terms of NATO and all the countries, in terms of them rethinking their place in the world, and what, in fact, and who their alliances are.
There's a lot up for grabs internationally. A lot ofa lot going on.
The whole ideaI apologize for repeating this to some of you, but the whole idea that we're in a situation where technology has made things change so drastically.
You know, when there was a lot written, when Gutenberg invented the printing pressfor realhow it fundamentally changed international relations at the time, how it fundamentally changed the ability of people to communicate with one another. And it changed the politics of the world.
And it goes all the way straight through to everything from the electronic changeseverything from the telegraph to the telephone to television. You know, think of thisI know it sounds silly to bring it up; it's minorbut Nixon may very well have won had he been more accustomed to television. Not a joke. Not a joke. Not a joke.
And look what's happened now. Everything is changing because technology has changed. There are no editors anymore. There are no editors anymore. The ability of newspapers to have much impact is de minimis. They've been overtaken by the internet. And more happens, in terms of the internet, without a single editor at all.
How do people know the truth? What do theyhow do they makemake a distinction between fact and fiction? There's so muchso much going on. And we're in the middle of this.
And the truth of the matter isI genuinely believe thisthat the world is looking to us. Not a joke. Even our enemies are looking to us to figure out how we figure this out, what we do.
You know, folks, I have spent probablynot probably; the staff actually calculatedwell over 200I think it was 220, 225 hours directly in contact with the heads of state at NATO and the European Union, just holding it together. Not a joke. Not a joke.
One thing that Putin decidedcounted on was us splitting NATO. Not a joke. Splitting NATO. And look what's happening. Look what's happening in the eastern front of NATO. Look what Poland is doing now. Look what's happening. And Poland is sticking there. But how about Hungary? What's happening? Look what's happened recently in Spain and Italy.
Folks, you know, there's a lot at stake. But I'm absolutely convinced we have the capacitywe have the capacity to lead the world to a place that it's never been.
I saw a big article todayI didn't even realize it; it was in the front page of the New York Timesabout ""Biden Has Declared the End of a Cold War Period After World War II."" Well, it heldit heldkept the peace, essentially, since 1946. It's a different world. A totally different world right now.
Did any of you ever think you'd have a Russian leader, since the Cuban Missile Crisis, threatening the use of tactical nuclear weapons that wouldcould only kill three, four thousand people and be limited to make a point?
Did anybody think we'd be in a situation where China is trying to figure out its role relative to Russia and relative to India and relative to Pakistan?
I've spent more time with Xi Jinping than any person inany head of state in Americain the world. I spent overthey keep count of it78 hours' worth. Of that, 68 were in person, over the last 10 years, because Barack knew that he couldn't be dealing with a Vice President. And so, he assigned me. I've traveled 17,000 miles with him.
This is a guy who understands what he wants but has an enormous, enormous array of problems. How do we handle that? How do we handle that relative to what's going on in Russia? And what I think is maybe one of the most dangerous nations in the world: Pakistan. Nuclear weapons without any cohesion.
So, folks, there's a lot going on. A lot going on. But there's also enormous opportunities for the United States to change the dynamic in the second quarter of the 21st century.
And one of the ways that occurs is how we handle ourselves. You've heard me say this before, some of you: When I went to the first G-7 meeting of the major democraciesmost powerful democracies in the worldI showed up in February after we had just been elected. And I sat down and I said, ""America is back."" I know all these folks; I knew them from before. I said, ""America is back."" You know what the comment was? ""For how long?"" ""For how long?""
""Put yourself""as one of them said to me""Put yourself in the position of""they said, ""Mr. President, what would you think if you went to bed tonight and got up in the morning and learned that the British Parliament had been raided by over a thousand people, broken down the doors to the House of Parliament, killed several leaders, et cetera, et cetera? What would you think about the state of events?""
And what would you think? You'd think England was gone. You'd think democracy had collapsed in England. Well, guess what? What do you think people think about what happened here? What do you think people thought about what happened here?
So NancyNancy hasyou know, she's given me credit for an awful lot of things a little bit earlier. But not a single one of them would have happenedno hyperbolenot a single one of them would have happened without Nancy's leadership in the House and the Senate. And the Senate.
And I'm not joking. Think about this: You know, I'veit's fair to say we've got more done in the first 2 years thanthan any President in the past has.
Ino, notbutif you recall, even though Nancy did say, when Ishe was telling me her point of view, which is always straightforward[laughter]thatshe was telling me her point of view, and I said: ""Nancy, I understand. I wrote the damn bill."" [Laughter]
But think about this: In the beginning, all the things that we got passed, I had campaigned on before even they were introduced. They're what I ran on. But none of them went anywhere at first. None of them went anywhere at first until Nancy stepped up.
And by the way, the DCCC has a hell of a chair in a guy named Sean Patrick Maloney. And I want to recognize the people we're working for here: Julia Brownley, who's California 26. Ted Lieu, California 30 [33]*. Brad Sherman. Maxine Waters. And Dina Titus of Nevada, and Steve Horsford of Nevada.
And look, I'm not going to repeat what Nancy said, but the fact is that the American Rescue Plan, it not only created jobs, ityou know, before that was passed, there had been 2 million people who a been vaccinated. Because of that, we vaccinated 220 million people.
In the meantime, we can't underestimate a million people died. A million people died. And the psychological impact on the Nation is profound. We don't even talk about it. I speak with our Surgeon General about the mental needs of American people to deal with all that's happened.
Think about your kids and your grandkids when they've graduated from high school and college in this period. What did they get to celebrate? They didn't have their proms. They didn't have graduation ceremonies. They didn't have all the things that we took for granted, but are part of what gives people confidence and gives themlet's them grow up in a way thatwhere there's some sense of thatof a future.
But look what they keep doing. They keep moving. They keep moving.
So there's a whole lota whole lot that's out there that we've overcome. But because of the willingness of people to say, okay, not one Republican voted for the Recovery Actnot onebut guess what? It's the reason why everything from the State of California to the little State of Delaware stayed afloat, because tax base was lost. And guess what? All those first responders, all those teachers, all those firefighters, all those cops, all those essential workers were able to be kept on[inaudible]because weNancyled the fight to make sure that they had the money to keep the States going. That's what it was about.
And you talk about the infrastructure law. You know, weI mean, we used to be ratedhaving an infrastructure that put us in a position where we werehad probably the second, if not the first, best infrastructure in the world. Well, guess what? We got down to number 22, in terms of the competence of our infrastructure: from our ports, to our roads, to our bridges, to the whole notion of lead pipes and the purity of our water, and all of it. But we passed the infrastructure bill. We did get a few Republicans for that. A few Republicans voted for that.
And then we talk about guns. Well, Nancy was able to get passed, along with Chuck Schumer, the first major gun legislation in 30 years.
But Nancy got passed the assault weapons ban. And the Senate didn't pass it. And look at whatthe news today. I'm not going to go through the news today, but look what happened today in two different places with AK-47s. They're weapons of war. They have no place in society. None. Zero.
And by the wayand so, you knowand the burn pits. If you'll excuse a point of personal privilege, my son Beau was one of those guys. My son Beau was the attorney general. He wasshould be the one standing here talking to you, not me; he was a better man than I am. Not a joke. That's a flat truth. He was attorney general. He soughthe had to get a dispensation, in effect, from theto join the National Guardto go from the National Guard to Iraq for a year after having volunteered as assistant U.S. attorney in Philadelphia to be in Ukraineexcuse me, in Kosovo for 9 months.
The only war memorial built to a foreigner in the state of Kosovo was to my son Beau. Only one. And here's the deal: He spent a year in Iraq, and he lived within about 300 yards of one of those burn pits. And he died of brain cancer. I'm notand a lot of people have suffered worse than I have. And he did.
But the point is this: I made a commitment when I did the State of the Union last year that we were going to take care of our veterans. And guess what? All those veterans nowthose who are still alive who weren't getting any care, and those who died and their families, in fact, were able to get compensation for what happened. They lost a head of household, in most cases. And guess what?
We're in a situation now where they're able to begin to move those families. We have a lot of obligations as a public. We only have one truly sacred obligationsacred: It's to equip and prepare those we send to war and care for them and their families when they come home. That's a sacred obligation.
And only 1 percent1 percent of this Nation1 percent of the Nation is the backbone and sinew of this country and defending us. One percent.
And so, look, the whole point of this is that there's so muchand again, we were having trouble getting that passed, believe it or not. Nancy stood up. She moved the House. And finally, the Senate and everybody else moved.
But so I guess what I'm saying is, when you get to the Inflation Reduction Act, what was that all about? It was all aboutthe biggest part of that was twofold. One, taking on Pharma. You know, we pay the highest drug prices of any nation in the world for the same exact drugs, I might add. Same exact prescription.
Well, guess what? We got it changed so that, now, no senior on Medicare will have to pay more than $2,000 a year for their drug prices, no matter what the cost of their cancer drugs are, no matter what it is.
And some of you have type 2 diabetes. Some of you have children who have type 2 diabetes. You know, it costs 10 bucks to make that insulin. Ten dollars to make it and package it. And it's charging somewhere between 300 and 700 times the cost.
Well, we had a bill that said that everybody, including the 200,000or excuse me, 2 million children who have that samesame type of that diabetes would not have to pay more than $35. Well, guess what? Nancy got it all passed; the Senate couldn't get the second part passed. And so it's only seniors now.
But the point is, we're changing people's lives. And I think one of the things that occurred as a consequence ofexcuse me for going on on this, but theone of the things that occurred as a consequence of the pandemic was a sense of what can we do as a country.
The idea that we thoughtyou know, the reason we were thoughtand many of you are very sophisticated and travel the worldthe ""ugly Americans"" isI was with Xi Jinping in the Tibetan Plateau. And he turned to me and he said, ""Can you define America for me?"" This is the God's truth. He's repeated it. I said, ""Yes, one word: possibilities."" We believe as Americans that anything is possible, anything at all. But the American people began to doubt whether we really can do anything.
Look, if I could wave a wand and do one thing, I'd cure cancer. Why not? That's the biggest problem in the world. But to demonstrate to people we could take on a subject that no one thought could be defeated and do it.
Well, that's what we're trying to dodemonstrate to the American people there's reason for optimism. There's overwhelming reason for optimism. We are better equipped than any other nation in the world to lead the 21st century by farby far.
And in addition to the legislation we passed, the Inflation Reduction Actthe reason we called it ""inflation reduction,"" there's more than one way to reduce the price of anfor an average family. My dad used to say, ""The way it works is, at the end""and my dad was a well-read high-school-educated guy whose greatest regretgreatest regrethe never went to college. But he was a decent, honorable, well-read man.
And he used to say, ""What is needed is, after all the bills are paid by an ordinary, hard-working or middle class folks, is there anything left over to have just a little breathing room?""
There's one moremore than one way to provide the breathing room. You deal with the necessities. What's a necessity for the vast majority of families? Prescription drugs. What's a necessity for the vast majority of American families? We go down the list of things. We are affecting the ability for them towhen they buy a new appliance, to haveget a tax credit for buying an energy-efficient appliance; be able to reduce, by weatherizing their home, and be able to save on average 5,000 bucks a year. For an ordinary family that's a big damn deal. A big deal. And it affects their bottom line.
I could go on, but I won't.
So we're going towe stillit stillinflation is out there. It's real. And a lot of people are getting hurt badly by it. But we can takewe can overcome this.
The other thing I like to say to youand I'm going on too long, and I apologizeis thatyou know, let's take a look atcan anybodyif anybody in here can tell me what the Republican platform is. [Laughter]
No, I know we laugh about it, but think about it. What is the Republican platform?
Audience member. Disenfranchisement!
The President. Well, more than that.
Audience member. Staying in power!
The President. Well, they've been very specific, and we've not paid much attention to it.
First of all, they want tothey want to make sure that they codifynot Roebut codify the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs. They want to make sure that they make sure we do not take on the gun industry. They want toI could go on.
But if we're going to keep the Houseif you keep the House for us, and give us two more Democrats, we're going to pass a lot of things that are going to make a big difference, and support the work of thelooklook at the work Nancy did with the January 6th Committee. Think about what's happening.
And she had the courage to doI didn't recommend it to her, but she had the courage to do what I firmly believed. Bennie Thompson, a Black man from Mississippi, who was one of the first guys to endorse me way early onno, I'm seriouslook how he stepped up. Look how he stepped up.
And by the way, Liz CheneyLiz Cheney and I agree on virtually nothing in terms of substance. No, I mean it sincerely. But it used to be like that all the time. We got along. I used to fight like hell in the United States Senate with very conservative Republicans who were honorable people, had a very different view. Look what's happened.
And the message to the American people is coming across really clearlyreally clearly. And I think we're going to see some real change as a consequence of the work of the committee.
And look, if you take a look at it, and you look at Nancy and the Congress for support for UkraineI spent a lot of time in Ukraine. I spent a lot of timeI've spent probably 3 weeks in Ukraine before the war started, making the case that they had to clear up their circumstances in terms of corruption.
But here we go. Ukrainians have shown enormous courage. I think it surprised everybody. And some of you are military women and men, and you know the courage that they suppliedand it's because, with Nancy's leadership, we've provided over $16 billion in weapons to them, and another 15or there or so aboutin terms of the daily needs for them to maintain their government.
And so, look, everythingeverything here we deal with in less than 30 days is at stake. What's on the ballot? The right to choose. The right to privacy. Social Security and Medicare. Climate. Our very democracy. We have more than half the American people worried about the sustaining of American democracy. Did you ever think you'd see that in the polling data? And they're not political polls. They're done by networks.
And folks, look, if Republicans get control, their number-one prioritythey've stated it very straightforwardis repeal the Inflation Reduction Act. Medicare's power to negotiategone. Two-thousand-dollar capgone. Thirty-five-dollar cap on insulingone. The biggest climate investment in all of historygone. The 15-percent corporate taxgone. Which is paying for a great deal of this, by the way.
And by the way, the reason I did that: I come from the corporate State of the world, Delaware. More corporations incorporated in Delaware than every other State in the Nation combined. And I'm not anticorporation. I got elected six times in Delaware, but they know that I think they've got to pay their fair share.
Fifty-five corporations in 2020 made $40 billion, did not pay a single penny in taxes. Not a single, solitary penny. That changed. It's only 15 percent, but it's enough to pay for most of this.
And, folks, look, in the meantime, you've got Rick Scott, the guy heading up the Republican Senate campaign committee, from Florida. And you gothe says Social Security and Medicare, as well as veterans benefits, should be in the chopping block every 5 years. Every 5 years you'd have to affirmatively revote for the existence of the programs or cut the programs. You did nothing, they go out of existence.
Then along comes a guy named Johnson, from the State of Wisconsin, who is not what you call a particularlyanyway, I won't characterize it. [Laughter] Johnsonthis is true. Theand you have Republicans supporting this. He suggests 5 years is too long; every year we have to vote on the existence of those programs.
What do you think happens? You've been paying Social Security tax since you weregot your first job when you were 16 years old. This is how these guys look at things.
Republicans are going to ban abortion nationwide. By the way, if they do that, as long as I'm President, I'll veto it so it won't happen. But no exceptions for rape or incestnoneor the life of the mother.
And look, you know, literally, the right to vote is at stake. Who gets to count the vote? No, that's not a joke. Who gets to count it? And how do you count? And who gets to make the decision? State legislatures or Statewhy do you think they have 253, I think it isor 255 election deniers running for office in the Republican PartyHouse, Senate?
But guess what? Secretaries of Statesecretaries of State, they can change the nature of whether or not we have a democracyhow votes are counted. The Republicans love to attack what we've done, but it doesn't stop from taking credit for when it works.
You know, you saw thein the infrastructure law, they attack it and attack me as a ""Socialist,"" anybody who voted for it. ""This is socialism."" And theybut then they, interesting enough, sendprivately send letters to my administration asking for help. And they list the names. I'm not going to take the time to tell you who they are, but they listI didn't know there were so many Socialists in the Republican caucus. [Laughter]
But here's the point: I'm going to still support those programs if they're needed because I promised I'd be a President for all the people. Notif they have a bad leader, I wasn't going to deny them the right to have the work done on thethat needs to be done.
But look, it's been a hard few years. And the bright side is, 10 million jobs have been created, 3.5-percent unemployment, nearly 700,000 manufacturing jobs. ""Made in America"" is not just a slogan, it's real.
And look, I was just up in Poughkeepsie with Sean Patrick Maloney. Sean, are you still here? Okay.
Representative Sean P. Maloney. I'm here.
The President. Okay. Well, Seanwith IBM. Because of theof the CHIPS Act that we passed and Nancy got throughbecause of that act, in Poughkeepsie, New York, IBM is investing $20 billion in quantum computing. We used to bewe used to investwe used to invest 2 percent of our GDP in research and development. It's down to 0.7 percent0.7 percent.
The rest of the world is investing much more in the future than we are, but we're changing that.
In Syracuse, Micron is investing $100 billion over the next 10 years. And then you have in Intel, out in Ohio, outside of Columbus, it's become a field of dreams. Twenty billion dollars as a commitment. They'll probably go to 100 over the next 10 years. That creating tens of thousandsof thousands of jobs.
And guess what? You have something on60 percent of those jobs don't require a college degree. They have apprentice programs. And guess what the average salary inout in Intel is going to be, out in Ohio? $128,000.
So this is about expanding opportunity. And look, folks, my point is, we've never beenI've never been more optimistic about America. I really haven't. We have a chance to do so much at this inflection point. I really mean it. I'm absolutely confident. There's not a damn thing we can't do. Not a damn thing we can't do if we remember who in the hell we are.
This is the United States of America. Whatever we've set our mind to in our history, we have gotten it done when we've done it together. So please, please, please keep a Democratic House of Representatives. We'll get it done.
Thank you.

The President. Before you leavebefore she walks off the stage, I want her to understand why, for certain, she has this job. First of all, I know I get criticized by the other team for being the most pro-union President in history. There's a simple reason for that. People don't understand how many yearhow many months and years of apprenticeship?
Yurvina Hernandez, Level 4 apprentice, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority Purple Line Extension Transit Project Section 3. Four.
The President. Four. Four years. So they think anybody just shows up for a union job and gets a job. It's like going back to school. It is going to school. And they're the best in the world. They're the best in the world, all of you. I'm not just saying that.
The middle class built this country, and unions built the middle class. And you're on this job because that woman said, ""Hire local.""
Anyway, thank you.
Ms. Hernandez. Thank you.
The President. Well, Mr. Mayor and soon-to-be Ms. Mayor[laughter]IMayor Garcetti has been a good friend for a long, long time. To be really honest about it, I probably wouldn't be standing here addressing you had he not helped me a lot. And thank you for welcoming me into your city.
And I want to thank Hilda Solis. I resent the fact she left Washington, because I miss her personally, but hershelove of her job and what she's doing for Los Angeles is so consequential.
And a special thank you to California Democrats in Congress, many of whom are here today. Senator Padilla, Iyou areyou're the same way. You jumped in to help me out. You're doing one hell of a job as a freshman Senator. I mean that sincerely. And it's noticed by everyone. It's great to see you.

The President. Karen, you're the best. You're the best.
Look, folks, you know, one of the things about a real leader is: The place they're trying to lead matters a lot of how much they love the place they live. She loves this city, and she's always working with the people of her district.
And I know this isyou and Ted are about a blockyou know, separated by a street. But you're always working to expand opportunity and a better future for all our children and our families for this city and all around the country. And you never leave anybody behind. You never leave anybody behind.
And that's exactly what this project will do that you all are building. It's going to be a better life for everybody. And I'm notthat's not hyperbole.
Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index Report for September 
Before I begin, let me say a few words quickly about today's report on inflation. Americans are squeezed by the cost of living. It's been true for years, and folks don't need to bea report to tell them they're being squeezed.
Fighting this battle every day is a key reason why I ran for President of the United States. The way I think about it is the way my dad used to talk about it. And he'd say, ""You know, after the end of the month, when you get your paycheckat the end of the month, do you have enough to pay for everything you owe, all your bills, and would you have a little left for some breathing room, just a little bit of breathing room.""
And that's my view of what is important and critical. And a lot of people are hurting these days. And today's report shows, though, some progress. Overall, inflation was 2 percent over the last 3 months. That's down from 11 percent over the prior 3 months. And that's progress.
But a lot of it is the result of getting the cost of living at the gas pump down by morenow even in California nowby more than a dollar nationally andsince the start of this summer. And there's a big difference for working folks. But the price of gas is still too high, and we need to keep working to bring it down. And I'll have more to say about that next week.
We also need to make more progress bringing down the prices across the board. That's why I just couldn't disagree more with my Republican friends who say the biggest problem in our economy right now is that working folks are making too much money. No, that's the argument: Workers are making too much money, and too many people are working, too many jobs are being filled. I think that's a bunchas we Irish say, a bunch of malarkey. [Laughter]
The biggest problemthe biggest problemis the world's challenge: global inflation and the pandemic and Putin's unconscionable invasion of Ukraine.
Here's the deal: Because of my economic plan, we are better positioned than any other major economy in the world to weather the challenges and come through this as a stronger country. We've created nearly 700,000 manufacturing jobs just in the last 19 months. Businesses are investing here in America at record rates. They see what I see: the resilience of the American people and the potential of building an economy from the bottom up and the middle out.
Look, when the middle does well and the bottom has a chance, the wealthy do very well. They never get hurt. I'm so tired of trickle-down; I'm finished with it.
So we're going to keep at it by taking on Big Pharma and the insurance companies, especially the health insurance companies. With the help of Democrats in Congress here today, I signed the Inflation Reduction Act, which gave Medicare the power that we've been trying to get for the last 30 years: the power to negotiate lower prescription drug prices. We pay the highest drug prices of any nation in the world.
For seniors on Medicare, we're capping the cost of prescription drugs at $2,000 a year even if they're doingusing the most expensive cancer drug in the world. We're capping the cost of insulin, which is 30, 40 times higher than the number I'm going to give you, at $35$35 a month. You can't go higher than that.
Folks, we're locking in savings on health care premiums for millions of people on the Affordable Care Act.
And today I'm announcing that Social Security benefits are going to go up by an average of $140 a month, even as Medicare premiums go down. So, folks, seniors are going to get ahead of inflation next year. For the first time in 10 years, their Social Security checks will go up while their Medicare premiums go down.
Here's my final point. We've got an election in a month. Voters have to decide.
Democrats are working to bring down the cost of things andthat are talked about around the kitchen table, from prescription drugs to health insurance to energy bills and so much more. We're standing up for working people and their right to get a raise and get a better job.
Republicans are campaigning every day on an agenda to raise your costs. You know, I should point out before I go on a little: The Republican platform so far for this off-year election is led by a Senator fromSenator Scott from down in Florida, as well as theSenator Johnson from up in Wisconsin. And you know what they argue? Ithis is on paper. That, in fact, we should be in a situation where Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid should have to be voted on every single year. Every year. The guy from Florida says, ""Every five."" But the guy from Wisconsin says, ""No, every year, including veterans benefits.""
So the idea is, you either vote for them or they go out of existence or you cut them, but you've got to affirmatively vote every year. You've been paying into a Social Security account from the time you were 16 years old at your first summer job. It's not fair.
And the biggest thing they say they want to do, they want to get rid ofget rid ofthe number-one priority, and they've spoken to it: They want to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act. That means they're going to repeal the $2,000 cap on prescription drugs. Gone. Cap on insulingoneat 35 bucks. Savings on health care premiums, average of $400 a persongone. Savings on your utility billsgone.
Corporate minimum tax of 15 percentby the way, they got very upset with me. They got very upset with me. You know what I did? Well, there were 55 American corporations made $40 billion in 2020, did not pay a single pennynot a pennyin Federal tax. So I was so harsh. I suggested they pay 15 percent. Less than you pay. Fifteen percent to pay for all this, and it's paying for it.
But guess what? My Republican colleagues think that's unfair. They want to repeal that tax.
Folks, you know, Republicans are going to make youworking, middle class folkspay higher taxes. And the biggest corporationsand by the way, in every single piece of legislation I've gotten passed with the help of the people here, we have not raised the tax on anybody making less than 400,000 bucks a year one penny. I wish I was making 400you were making 400 grand. But not a single penny. No, I mean it: not a single penny.
If Republican wins, inflation is going to get worse. It's that simple.
Infrastructure Improvement Efforts 
Now, to today's event. For too long, we've talked about building the best economy in the world. We've talked about asserting America's leadership, with the best and safest roads, railroads, ports, airports, et cetera. Now we're finally getting it done.
We're finally deciding that instead of being rankedcatch this: The last 8 years or so, America infrastructureyour bridges, the rails, everythingyou know what we were rated in the world, the most powerful nation in the world? Number 13. Thirteen in the world, the United States of America.
Where do businesses come to invest? Where they get their products out of the port and they get their products out of the yard and they can have access: bridges, roads, highways.
Look, we should be ranked number one. Instead of Infrastructure Week being a punchline under my predecessor, Infrastructure Decade is a headline on my watch for the next 10 years.
And last year, with the leadership of your Members here in Congress, the ones that are here today, I signed into law once-in-a-generation investments on our Nation's roads, highways, bridges, railroads, ports, airports. A law that's going to deliver clean air; safer water systems, eliminating lead pipes; electric grid to deliver clean energy; high-speed internet; electric charging stations all across America, the power to fleetto take care of the fleets of new electric vehicles. It's called the bipartisan infrastructure law.
And by the way, we got awe got some Republicans to vote for it. About a third of them voted for it and got it passed. And I thank them for that.
And it's the most significant investment America has made in our infrastructureliterally, not figurativelysince the Interstate Highway System built by Dwight D. Eisenhower.
And, folks, it includes the largest investment in public transit in the history of America. There's no better example of what's happening than right here in Los Angeles. Nearly 10 million people live in L.A. CountyI don't have to tell you thatmore than any county in the United States. And every year, people take more than 22 million rides on your subways, your light rail, and your buses. It's how so many folks get to work, school, and how tourists and locals explore this world-class city.
But the transit system needs an upgrade, badly. You know that. You need to connect more neighborhoods, ease traffic congestion, air pollution, and make it easier for people to get around and where they need to go. That's exactly what you're doing. That's exactly what you're doing. But it's being funded in part through this infrastructure lawyour local taxes and infrastructure law.
This project, the extension of Metro's Purple Line, it's going to cover one of L.A.'s busiest areas and job centers from UCLA, the future home ofto many sites of the 2028 Olympics. And theby the way, congratulations. I did not use any undue influence. [Laughter] I just said I like L.A. Anyway. [Laughter] You'll get in trouble.
The first Metro rail line opened in 1990 with 7017 stations. Since then, more lines have been built to meet the needs of this vast city. Under Mayor Garcetti's leadership, you finally got going on extending the Purple Line. You got a big boost in funding from the infrastructure law to finish the job. The extension of the Purple Line is going to add seven new stations, build a reliable high-speed connection between downtown and the Westside. A trip from Koreatown to the VA campus, which now takes over an hour on a bussometimes longer than thatit's going to shrink to 25 minutes on rail.
We expect to see nearly 80,000 more riders on Metro every day, thanks to the Purple Line extension; roughly 27,000 fewer car rides every day. It's going to affect pollution in a significant, positive way: 124,000 fewer tons of carbon dioxide pumped into the air by Los Angeles every year124,000. That's what it takes out of the air. Nearly 14 million gallons of gasoline saved.
And it's an easier commute for half a million people who come to work every day in Centerin Century City or elsewhere on the Westside.
Plus, this project is a job creator: more than 100,000 workersunion workersmore than 100,000 workers, hard at work on the entire Purple Line extension, all three sections.
And here's something else: Typically, companies that bid for projects like this one aren't required to hire locals. I mentioned this before, but it's important to mention. When Karen pushed for a provision in the infrastructure billI hadn't even thought about it, to be honest with youto give agencies like the L.A. Metroand thank you, by the way, for what you're doing, manthe L.A. Metro the power to require contractors to hire local and make sure the projects that transform communities like yours also create jobs for local people from the communities. Local workers can be first in line for these jobs thanks to Karen. And I really mean it, Karen. Thank you very much.
Look, this is just one projectone projectthe infrastructure law is making possible in California. For example, we're moving forward with the East San Bernardino [Fernando]* Valley Light Rail Project, a project that is close to Senator Padilla's heart. And he has not let me forget about it ever. [Laughter] And I haven't. Haven't, haven't. And you're going to bring fast and convenient public transportation options to one of the busiest travel corridors in America.
We're going to help electrify L.A.'s entire bus fleet by 2030. Entire buselectrify. That means every single bus in L.A. across nearly 200 bus lines will be electric, which will significantly reduce pollution, especially for folks getting on and off diesel buses who have asthma. Folks, diesel exhaust can really affect people's health. That's why we've been helping school districts all across the country, I might add, electrify their schoolbuses to keep kids andavoid childhood asthma.
Los Angeles set a goal of zero emissions for their bus fleets by the end of this decade. We're going to help make sure you get that done.
And there's more. America invented modern aviation. We've allowed our airports, though, to lag behind our competitors. Not anyone. Not anyone. We're investing at LAX, including renovations to the central terminal to make it easier to park, to pick up and drop off, to make it to your gate as quickly as possible, and I hope, eventually, to get light rail there too.
Then that's what we're doing with our ports. Earlier this year, I visited the Port of Los Angeles, thedealing with the whole issue of on-time access to products that we need to make products here in America. We've done a lot of work there to ease backups and delays, bringing together port operators, shipping companies, labor to move more goods more rapidly.
Last Christmas, we were against theeveryone's expectation. We managed to get nearly 97 percent of all gifts delivered on time because of those changes, despite the delays caused by the pandemic.
And now we're going further. We're building a new four-lane road to the Port of L.A. to make it easier for trucks to drive up to the container terminal, load up their goods for transport. And the Port of Long Beach, one of the busiest container ports in the Nation, we're going to deepen the channels so ships can move in and out of that harbor faster. Folks, this is going to make our supply chains more efficient, make trade quicker and easier, and reduce air pollution.
Then we're going to rebuild bridges and highways all across this State like we're doing across the country.
We're working every single day to make sure California has access to high-speed, affordable internet. Aren't youI don't ever want to see again where a family has to park in front of a McDonald's to do online schooling because they don't have access. Already, nearly 2 million homes across California are getting low-cost or free internet because of the infrastructure law.
And we're going to provide clean water across California, replacing lead pipes, worn-out service lines, replenishing Big Bear and other critical water sources, and expanding water recycling as we deal with this historic drought. And it's real. They're just a few of the examples of the more than 350 projects across California, with more to come.
And when you see these projects in your neighborhoodcranes going up, shovels in the ground, lives being changedI want you to feel the way I do: pride. Pride in what we can do when we do it together. This is what I mean when I say we're building a better America.
For most of the last century, we led the world by a significant margin because we invested in our people, and we invested in ourselves. We used to invest 2 percent of our entire gross domestic product in research and development. It's down to .7 percent. This is the United States of America. But along the way, we stopped. Not everyone though. But I have to say one thing: Even Republicans can get behind this law, although some of them have a funny way of showing it. [Laughter]
Last week, I sawyou saw it tooan interesting report on CNN. You all may have seen. I don't know if CNN is here, but they put out a report. The headline was, quote, ""Republicans Called Biden's Infrastructure Program 'Socialism.' And Then They Asked for [More] Money."" End of quote. [Laughter] In my church, they say, ""Bless me Father for I have sinned."" [Laughter]
But look, the report describes Republicans in detailI'm not going to mention their nameswho voted against the infrastructure bill, called me and it ""socialist,"" and then attacked theall Democrats who were passing it""socialism,"" ""radical spending,"" ""rushed,"" and ""irresponsible.""
Well, now they're quietly and privately sending letters to my administration asking for money. They're talking about how important projects are in their districts and for all Americans. Well, guess what? I'm going to give them the money because it's not about them, it's about the people they represent.
And Speaker Pelosi says, ""They vote no, and then they take the dough."" [Laughter] Can't make this stuff up. I've got to say, I'm surprised to see there are so many Socialists in the Republican caucus. [Laughter] Well, even if they voted against it, I said, I promised during my campaign I'd be President for all of America, every American. Whether you voted for me or not, I'm not leaving anyone behind.
And we're building a better America together for everyone, even in the districts of the Congressmen who voted against it.
Let me close with this: It's been a rough 4 or 5 years for the country. For a lotfor a lotof your families, things are still pretty tough. Even though you got good-paying jobs and health insurance, it's still pretty tough. But there'sthere are bright spots where America is reasserting itself, like here, where the best workers in the world are hard at work building a better future for all of us. They're providing our best days to be available to us. And they're ahead of us; they're not behind us.
We just have to keep it going, and I know we can. I mean it sincerely. I know we can. I've never been more optimistic about America's future, particularly relative to the rest of the world. We're better positioned than any nation in the world. And every other nation that I'm aware of is aware of it. When I meet with the heads of state in Europe, in Asia, they know it.
We just have to remember who we are. We are the United States of America, and there's nothing, nothing beyond our capacitynothingwhen we decide we're going to do it together.
God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thanks.

The President. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[At this point, the President picked up a handheld microphone.]
Is this one working? Hello, hello, hello. Not working, is it? Is thiscan you hear me?
Audience members. Yes!
The President. All right. Well, by the way, I wanted to come out here because I love being in Colorado. I love being in the West. I love even being in Alaska.
One of the things I was saying earlier to some of the folks that we came over with is that one of the great treasures we have are our national forests and our national parks. And from the time my kids were old enough to travel with me, I've taken them to mostalmost every national park in the countrydown to Colorado, down the Snake River, just everywherebecause I wanted them to seeI wanted them to see what so many people don't get to see.
But, folks, I want to thank Scott for the introduction and mostly for his service. You're right, this is the story of ""America the Beautiful."" The way you talk about being a forest ranger is justyou just can just feel the power in this place when you talk about it.
And as you just heard, you have, the same way, these incredible leaders around you thanking you. Governor Polis, heJoe, I tell you what: I didn't know that the former Governor had worked for you. [Laughter] But Joe from the House, and John and Michaelall of you have been determined, over the years, to protect these sacred and historic lands.
And Michael came over hereI wantMichael to come back up here a second. [Laughter] Come on, Michael.
[At this point, Sen. Michael F. Bennet approached the podium and shook the President's hand.]
And the reason why I doI want to tell you what happened here. This guy, he made this finally happenat least me signing this, certainly. And Ihe came to the White House, and he said, ""I told you what I need."" [Laughter] And I said, ""I'll do it."" You know why? I was worried he'd never leave the damn White House if he didn't go. [Laughter]
And I'm also honored to be joined by several Tribal leaders here, because this is your progeny, this magnificent land. You've been great stewards of these sacred lands.
But I just want you to know, the reason why he's an environmentalist: He married one. Otherwise, he'd sleep alone. [Laughter] So I just want you to know that.
Look, it's great to be with Tom Vilsack, Secretary of Agriculture; Brenda Malloy [Mallory], a Chair of our Council on Environmental Quality. And while she couldn't be here today, I especially thank our first Native American who is a Cabinet member, Deb Haaland, who is the InteriorSecretary of Interior.
Folks, as I said, when I served as Senator and Vice President, Jill and I made sure to take our children and grandchildren to national parks all around the country. They're treasures and wonders that define the identity of us as a nation. They're a birthright that we pass down from generation to generation. And they unite us.
And that's what today is all about. We're doing it not just for today, but for all the ages. And it's for the people of Colorado, but it's alsogoes well beyond the people of Colorado. It's for all the people across America and the world. It's a permanent, permanent decision, an action that no future President can overturn.
In 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt first used the Antiquities Act to designate a national monument. He essentially invented the national parks. Since then, Presidents of both parties have used the Antiquities Act to preserve America's natural treasures, from the Grand Canyon, to the Statue of Liberty, to Colorado's Canyons of the Ancients.
Today we'rethe authorities under the Antiquities Act, I'm establishing Camp Hale-Continental Divide National Monument today. This is the first new national monument of my Presidency under this authority.
When you think about the national beauty of Colorado and the history of our Nation, you find it here: more than 50,000 acres, including the Tenmile Range; soaring peaks and steep canyons; black bears, bald eagles, moose, mountain lions; waterfalls, pristine rivers, alpine lakes; a scantthe scent of wildflowers at the right time of the year; and a stunning backdrop of ski slopes and iconic trails.
These treasured lands tell the story of America. For thousands of years, Tribal Nations have been stewards of this sacred land, hunting game, foraging for medicinal plants, and maintaining a deep, spiritual bond with the land itself. But by the 1800s, mining activity and Federal Government drove out Indigenous Tribes from their homes. But those Tribes continued to use these sacred lands.
Last year, I issued a historic proclamation officially designating Indigenous Peoples' Day to honor the contributions of Native Americans to our society and acknowledgeacknowledgethe history of violence committed against them. Two days ago, we observed that day in this Nation. Today I'll be signing the proclamation to preserve these sacred Tribal grounds as a national monument.
It was also where the U.S. Army, as you've already heard, first and only mountain infantry division trained to take on the Nazis in World War II. The 10th Mountain Division stationed on the valley floor, surrounded by rugged boulders, forests, and mountains stretching 14 feet high14,000 feet high, among the tallest mountains in America. Facing high altitudes and harsh terrain, deep snow, bitter cold, soldiers at Camp Hale learned to scale rock, ski, and survive, preparing for the war they were about to fight.
That pivotal moment came, as the Senator pointed out, in February 1945: a surprise allied attack in the mountains of Italy. Imagine, it's pitch black, punishing cold. The mission, high in the mountains, that hinged on the skill, strength, and stamina that could have only been gained in a place like this.
They were more than ready. They were more than ready that day and since then. American soldiers of the 10th Mountain Division scaled that 1,800-foot cliff at night, caught the Germans by surprise, captured key positions, and broke through the German defense line at a pivotal point in the war.
Just imagineand I mean this sincerely. I say this as a father of a man who won the Bronze Star, the Conspicuous Service Medal, and lost his life in Iraq. Imagine the courage, the daring, and the genuine sacrificegenuine sacrificethey all made.
After the war ended, Camp Hale became the hub for innovation in winter warfare. And even when it closed in 1965, many veterans returned to the area. Some became scientists who studied rock glaciers, endangered animals, and wetland forests. Many returned to heal their wounds, both visible and invisible, seeking the solace and sovereignand serenity in ways that only nature can do.
Other veterans returned to build world-famous ski resorts, as you all know, and outdoor recreational industries to define Colorado today, industries that support millions of American jobs, generate hundreds of billions of dollars for our economy, and provide countless, countless memories for families.
I taught my boys to ski here. I taught my family to ski here. Iit'sand by the way, as you all know, especially for us Easterners, we talk about that at dinner. We talkno, I'm serious. All those memoriesall those memories that you all understandably take for granted, they're a big deal where I come from.
Today, as Commander in Chief, it's a true honor to be joined by two of the few surviving veterans of the original 10th Mountain Division. Francis Lovett. Franciswhere is Francis? He's going to come up later. Francis, as my mother would say, ""God love you, man."" God love you. A hundred years young. Enlisted in the Army at age 20, stationed at Camp Hale. Fought overseas. Earned two Bronze Stars andamong many other medals. A war hero who came home to become a teacher and a principal.
Thank you, Francis, for your service to our country and all you've done to get this monument designated. Thank you.
He's also joined by another 10th Mountain Division man, a guy named Robert Scheuer99 years young. Trained at this camp. Served his country before joining his dad's business. Just a few years ago, he came back here to Colorado to be with his family. Robert, thank you for your service. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
And I'm honoredI'm honoredto sign this proclamation to preserve this special part of our military history. In addition, as Secretary Vilsack just explained, today my administration is announcing steps to conserve the Thompson Divide, another 225,000 acres 60 miles from here. This is another congressional priority for Michael, John, and Joe.
We're standing with Colorado's farmers, ranchers, hunters, and anglers, who for have forged generations to protectprotectthe beautiful streams, aspen groves in the Thompson Divide area. Let me be clear: There is no current or planned oil exploration, production in the area. We're just keeping things as they've been for a long timefor the next 20 yearswhile we studyfor the next years, while we study whether we can get this done.
In my first year in office, I protected more lands and waters than any American President since John Kennedy. After the previous administration[applause]. After the previous administration rolled back protections, I restored full protection to three national monuments in Utah and New England.
And I signed and designated the Amache Japanese Incarceration Camp of World War II as a national historic site in Southeastern Colorado. We purchased additional land at Sand Creek Massacre Site, outside of Denver.
And we didand by the way, I'm not sure I would have understood how important this was had I not gotten to seensee these parts, until I understood the breathtaking nature of it. To stand there on the edge of a cliff in the Rio Grande, toyou know, looking at one thing, and it's justthere's not many cliffs. But then head up to the Grand Canyon; it's a cathedral. I mean, it takes your breath away. I've climbed it from the river up, and I've looked at it from the top down. It's breathtaking.
And I don't think, until you see some of these things, do you understand why it was so important to continue to preserve. And with the help of a Member of Congress here today, I signed the bipartisan infrastructure law and the Inflation Reduction Act that constitute the largest investment in climate ever in historythe history of the world.
We're investing billions of dollars to protect our iconic outdoors, preserve our historic sites, and address the devastating impacts of climate change. It includes historic funding for farmers and communities in the Upper and Lower Colorado River Basin so they can conserve water during the droughts. It includes historic investments in communities across Colorado to recover and rebuild from devastating wildfires.
And by the way, to all the Forest Service and the firefighters, we owe you big. I've traveled, just in the last 2 years, over every major wildfire in America in a helicopter. You realize more land has burned to the ground than occupies the entire State of New Jerseythe entire State of New Jerseyfrom New Mexico to Washington State to Idaho, across the entire West. It's devastating. And there's so much more we have to do. There's more that we have to do that really matters.
Let me close with this: Edward Abbey, a writer who once worked as a ranger in the Arches National Park in Utah, wroteand I quote: ""There are many such places. Every man, every woman carries in [his] heart and mind the image of the ideal place, the right place, the one true home, known or unknown, actual or visionary."" We're just at such a place here today.
And thanks to Michael Bennet, I now ask everyone who has worked so hard to help make this happen to bejoin me as we sign this official proclamation declaring Camp Hale-Continental Divide National Monument.
God bless you all, and thank you for what you've done.
Audience member. Thank you, Mr. President.
The President. No, thank you. Thank you all for fighting for this. I really mean it.
[The President assisted 10th Mount Division veterans Francis Lovett and Robert Scheuer onto the stage to join him at the signing table.] 
Mr. Lovett. Where do you want me to go? 
The President. Wherever you want to go. [Laughter] You can go right here. 
All right. Gentlemen, I sign this in your honor, in honor of all the warriors you fought with. Thank you. Thank you, thank you.
It says, the title, ""The Establishment of Camp Hale-Continental Divide National Monument by the President of the United States of America, proclamation.""

2022-10-11 00:00:00,Remarks at a Virtual Reception for Delaware Democratic Congressional Candidate Representative Lisa Blunt Rochester,"
The President. Well, thank you very much. And I thought I saw Fred Sears in that picture.
Participant. You have.
The President. And by the way, you know, I oweFred a debt of gratitude. Years and years ago, he's the reason why my first wife ended up marrying me. We flipped a coin. I said I wanted to go talk to her first, down in Floridain the Bahamas on spring break. And another guy named Mike McCrann wanted to see her. He said, ""I'll flip a coin."" And I won the toss. Thank you, Fred. I'm indebted to you, pal.
All kidding aside, look, I want to thank Lisa. Look, you're all a big part ofshe's a big part of why I got electedall of you arenational cochair of the campaign, helped lead the Vice Presidential Selection Committee, and a great partner, and someone I trust completely.
When Lisa ran for Congress, she'd say, ""When Lisa goes to Washington, we all go to Washington."" Well, that's Lisa. She brings everybody along. Doesn't leave anybody behind. Whether it's the economy or jobs or housing, public safety, environmental justice, the rights of working people, she's always there, always looking for solutions to bridge the divides. And we got some real divides these days.
She's always working for people and it'sshe takes it personally. I mean, she gets engaged. And we all know it runs in the family. Ted, you and I have known each other for a long time. You were a significant public official, but you're also probably one of the best college basketball players in history. Not a joke. He was an all-American.
And, Ted, we've known each other, as I've said, a long time.
And, Marla, you used to work for my Senate office. I didn't think I could make it without her, but I'm workingI'm hanging in there. But, Marla, thank you.
Look, so many of you on the call today are like family, and I want to thank you all for your support. We're less than 30 days away from the midterms, and the stakes are clear. The right to choose is on the ballot. Your Social Security you paid for your whole life is on the ballot. The safety of our kids and gun violence is on the ballot. Literally, the survival of the planet is on the ballot. And your right to vote. And democracy itself onis on the ballot.
And by the way, I point out that the vast majority of American people cite their concerns about the maintenance of our democracy as being a genuine concern. That hadn't been the case for God knowsanyway, well, that's unusual.
And I know it's been a rough 4 or 5 years around the country, but there's some bright spots. You know, when we came to office, the economy was flat on its back. We werehad a high unemployment rate. Things didn't look good at all. Only 2 million people had been vaccinated.
But wenow there's nearlywe created 10 million jobs. They tell methe historians tell me that more thanmore jobs created at this point in the Presidency than any President on record, with your help. We have record employment of 3.5 percent. We've created overalmost 700,000 manufacturing jobs.
Thisyou know, the storylook, it's been real clear: ""Made in America"" is no longer just a slogan, it's a reality. IBMI was just there with them up in Upstate New York. IBM is investing $20 billion to manufacture advanced quantum computers here in America. The company Micron is investing $100 billion to manufacture computer chips, the biggest investment of its kind in America. And it's doing it up in Syracuse, New York.
SK, one of the largest conglomerates in South Koreait's the second largest, I think, if I'm not mistakenmakes everything from semiconductors to pharmaceuticals. They've committed to invest $50 billion in investments in America.
And we still have a lot of work to do, but we're building a stronger economy than we've had before by a longshot andone that is built from the middle out and the bottom up.
As Ted can tell youyour dadI'm not a big trickle-down guy. Iyou know, when we build from the middle out, everybody does well. The wealthy do very well and the middle class does well, and the poor have a way up. And so itso it matters.
And yet you know, weRepublicans have a very different view. And by the way, if you ask anybody what is the Republican platform nowI'm not joking; I'm being deadly earnest. The Republican platform is basically they just want to undo what we've done. You know, theyattack Democrats. They really don't want to see theirthey don't they want us to see their plan.
Well, guess what? The guy in charge of the Senate races and the House races is talking about the need to changeput Social Security on the block every 5 years.
But then, there's a senior Senator from the State of Wisconsin, he comes along and says, ""No, we should do it every year."" Meaning, if you don't vote to reauthorize Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, they're gone or you can amend it and change it. That's a totally different thing.
Andbut you know, we need to focus on this November. Let's start with inflation. I think about inflation the way my dad used to talk about it, the way so many of you talk about it around the kitchen table: How much of your monthly bills are you able to pay? And after they're all paid and your necessities are paid, is there enough breathing room left just to have a little bit of space? Just a little bit of space.
Well, we're giving families a lot more breathing room. We passed the Inflation Reduction Act that is going to give Medicare the power to negotiate lower prescription drug costs.
By the way, we pay the highest drug costs of any major nation in the world by a longshot. It locks in savings on health care premiums for millions of people on the Affordable Care Act. And it saves families thousands of dollars in energy bills because of the ability to weatherize your home, reduce costs, and deal with major investments that areyou get tax benefits from investing in solar andevenand what it does to ordinary families when they have to replace the coffee machine, the refrigerator, whatever. You get a tax credit for using the most efficientmost efficient new machines.
And for the first time in a long time, we're going to make sure the biggest corporations begin to pay their fair share or at least close to their fair share in Federal taxes.
You know, there were threeof the Fortune 500 companies, there were, I think, 55 or 56 who, in the year 2000, made $40 billion and they didn't pay a single penny in Federal taxes. Not a single penny in corporate taxes. Now they have to pay a minimum of 15 percent.
And, folks, no oneno oneno one making less than $400,000 had one single penny of their taxesFederal taxes increased.
We're doing all this while we're reducing the Federal debt. We reduced the debt last year by $350 billionso much for ""big-spending Democrats""; more than a trillion dollars this year; and another $300 billion over the next decade because of the ability of Medicaid to negotiate drug prices.
And every singleevery singleDemocrat joined Lisa and voted for the Inflation Reduction Act, but every single Republicanevery onevoted against it. Not only that, now they're telling us their number-one priority is to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act if they gain control of the Congress, which means they're going to wipe out those benefits.
They're going toright now what we passed is: Nobody who is on Medicare will have to pay more than $12,000 a year. I meanexcuse me$2,000 a year for prescriptions. No matter how much the prescription costs, there's a $2,000 cap on prescriptions. A $35-a-month cap on insulin for folks on Medicare. It goes away. And these things go away if they win.
And by the way, it only cost the companies a total of 10 bucks to make that insulin. That's all it costs to make it and package it.
Savings on health care premiums under the Affordable Care Act go away thatwe saved a family of four $2,400 a year because they've got a better coverage now. And they're still determined to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
Remember, theythey've tried it like 50 times, right? Well, not 50probably 20, 25 times in the previous yearwhen we ran and a year before that. And what were they doing? They would take away the only protection someone who has a preexisting condition has, who can't afford private insuranceis to rely on the Affordable Care Act. To take that away, preexisting conditions raise the premiums exponentially.
And if Republicans get their way, they're going to get rid of the corporate minimum tax as well. The biggest corporations, as I said, pay zero in Federal income tax. Now they've got to pay 15 percent.
Republicans are also coming after Social Security and Medicare as well.
The Senator in charge of electing DemocratsI repeat this because it's importantto the U.S. Senate this yearelecting Republicans, I should sayhas proposed a plan to put Social Security on the chopping block every 5 years. And that means: Every 5 years, Congress will have to vote to cut, reduce, completely eliminate, or increase Social Security and Medicare. What do you think they're going to do? What do you think they're going to be able to play with that?
And we've been payingyou've been paying into Social Security since the time you started working as a 16-year-old.
And then there's Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin. I spokewhere it bears repeating. He thinks 5 years is too long to wait. He thinks every single year, Social Security and Medicare should be on the chopping blockevery single year. And if Congress doesn't vote to affirmatively keep it, it goes away. It's not just Social Security; it's Medicare as well. He wants to put everything else on the Federalveterans benefits are at risk, the whole deal.
I don't know where these guys come from.
And I hope you all saw the news report that describes Republicans who voted against the infrastructure bill attacking me and Democrats, what they call ""socialism,"" ""radical spending,"" ""rush to irresponsibility.""
What they're talking about is, they're talking about my forgiving debt for the average person making less than $75,000 a year for student debt. If for fiveif you hadfor $10,000. And if you had a Pell grant, it was more than that.
Now, Republicans are quietly, privately sending letters to my administration asking for the money back, taking awaytalking about how important the projects are for their districts.
But here's the other thing: When we passed thewhen we pass the legislation relating to the infrastructure bill, you know, only about 15, 16 of them voted for it. But guess what? Now they're out there holding press conferences, saying, ""The money for this bridge and the money for this road and the money for all of this was done, and they voted against the legislation, but they're taking credit for it now. Seriously.
And I've got to say, I was surprised to see there are so many Socialists in the Republican Party. You know, they called us the ""Socialists.""
Republicans are also coming after your freedoms on choice. Lisa and I are Democrats who want to codify Roe v. Wade. Republicans want a national ban with no exception for rape or incest, and they're going to criminalize doctors and nurses.
I could go on, but the bottom line is simple: If Republicans take control the Congress, historic victories we just won for the American people are going to be taken away. Every kitchen table cost was going to goareunder our position is going to go down. Your freedoms are going to be at greater risk.
But when it comes to electing the next Congress, it's not a referendum; it's a choice between two different ways of looking at our country. Democrats got a lot done. We have so much more to do. And it's understandable why people know we have so much more to do.
For example, we finally, for the first time in almost 30 years, got gun legislation passed. But it didn't include banning assault weapons. I'm going to get that done: banning assault weapons.
If we expand our majorities in the House and Senate, we're going to do a lot, and we need Lisa. And I mean it sincerely: We need Lisa. A lot of her colleagues look to her and look to her judgment. And she can cross the aisle and get some Republicans to move on some of our things. So it really matters.
We cannot afford to lose our majority in the House, and we have to increase our majority in the Senate. We're 50-50 now.
And I just thinkI apologize, I'm only supposed to have spoken a few minutes to you, but there's so much more to say. I don't want to keep you here, but I really, really think it's important that we understand how much is at stake.
You know, like I said, it's not political polling. Look at whatthey were askedthe broad polls done by the networks. The American people are, for the first time in God knows how long, worried about whether we can keep our democracy. Not a joke. Who's going to count the votes? Will it be the State legislature that can make a determination of who won the election? ThingsI could go on and on. There's so much at stake.
So I view thisthis off-year election as one of the most important elections that I've been engaged in, because a lot can change because the institutions have changed. The Supreme Court is more of an advocacy group these days than it is aevenhanded about it.
So there's a lot of stake. I strongly urge you to do all you can to continue to help Lisa. And I'm sureI have confidence in her. And she's going toshe has a long, long future. She's going to make a big difference in this country.
So I want to say God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Thank you.
Rep. Blunt Rochester. Mr. President, thank you so much. I appreciate you saying I have a long, long history. Many people on this call know I turn 60 this year, so it might not be as long as everybody thinks.
The President. What? I thought you were turning 30. [Laughter]
Rep. Blunt Rochester. Double that.
Andbut I have to say that being there at the very beginning of you making the decision to run, at the time in our history that you didagain, I am so proud. You have been able and we have been able to do some incredible things.
I started with: recover, rebuild and restore. Because, number one, we had to really diligently recover from a pandemic: putting shots in arms, getting businesses to stay open. We've got some doctors and others on this line that were helpful in those efforts too, with the American Rescue Plan and to be able to recover.
To rebuild, with the bipartisan infrastructure legislation, our roads, our bridges, our ports, broadband investments in the State of Delaware like we've never seen before.
And then you just look at everything from the PACT Act for our veterans. You look at what we've done for the Safer Communities, as we mentioned. That was also something30 yearsthat you started years ago to work on for gun safety.
And then theagain, you mentioned the Inflation Reduction Act. And we didn't even mention CHIPS and Science. I mean, there are so many things that you've been able to accomplish and we've been able to with the slimmest of slim majorities in the House and hardly any majority at all in the Senate.
And so
The President. I told the Vice President, every time she votes, she's going to win.
Rep. Blunt Rochester. Yes.
The President. And that turned out to be true.
Rep. Blunt Rochester. And you didn't even mention the first Black woman Supreme Court Justice.
So, in 2 years
The President. I'm proud of that.
Rep. Blunt Rochester. This has been 2 years that you have done what some presidents don't get done in a lifetime.
And so I just want to thank you so much for your support. I want to tell the people that are on this Zoom that this race does matter and means a lot. It means a lot to me because I want to represent Delaware in Congress.
And as you said in the beginning, everybody on here probably knows: When Lisa goes to Washington, we all go to Washington. That's our theme. And I am just grateful to be of service right now.
And we thank you so much for all that you have done for this country and all that you will do. And know that just like you have our backs, we've got your back too, Mr. President. We've got your back too.
The President. Well, I can tell you, I see a lot of people on this call I'm seeing now for the first time, like Robby Buccini. And the Buccinis helped me so much. They were raised in my living room like my son Beau and Hunter were raised in theirs.
I look out there and I see people that have been around for a long time like the Conways, who've been helping me, andno, I really mean it, Joe. And Ijust think there's so many people.
And Betsy, Iyou come from a family of real Democrats, and you're doing a hell of a job.
I justI'm going to get in trouble because I'm going to miss somebody on the screen here. But I just think it really matters. And there's a lota lot we can do.
And look, a lot we're doing, our kids' future depends on it. We are really
Rep. Blunt Rochester. Yes.
The President. We're at a real inflection point in world history. Things are changing, and the decisions we make the last 4 or 5 years and the next 4 or 5 years are going to determine what this country looks like for the next four or five generations. For real.
Rep. Blunt Rochester. And you've madeyou've
The President. In domestic policy and foreign policyanyway, I'm going on too long and keeping you too long. Thank you for helping, Lisa.
And I'm supposed to go deal with a little issue having to do with Ukraine. So thank you.
Rep. Blunt Rochester. Thank you again, sir. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you so much.

2022-10-11 00:00:00,Remarks to the United States Fire Administrator's Summit on Fire Prevention and Control,"
[The President addressed the summit, which was held at the National Emergency Training Center in Emmitsburg, MD, via videoconference.]
Doctor, thank you very, very much. It's very gracious of you. I appreciate it. And the U.S. Fire Administration is doing a great job.
Look, I want to take this opportunity to thank you all, tofor an opportunity to speak at this summit. And it's wonderful to see so many good friends, you know, sitting out there looking. EddieEd Kelly. And I think President Black is there. Kevin, I hopeI can't quite see whatI can't see you outin the front there, I think. And I actually wish I could be there with you in person. And you know I mean it.
You know, and I've had to pay respects with you this past weekend on the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial. Thirty years agoGod, it seems like 30 years ago. Thirty years ago, I was the original cosponsor with Paul Sarbanes and others of the National Fallen Firefighters Foundation Act. And over the years, I've spoken toat too manytoo many funerals for fallen firefighters. From the national events like the memorial of the Arizona 19 Hotshots in 2013, to the individuals in my home State that unfortunately are too numerous to name.
And each oneeach one of you is a hero to the community. You've touched people's lives. So I'd like to take a moment at the top here to honor the lives we've lost of those in the past 2 years, including from COVID: 135 on-duty firefighters in 2021, another 77 to date in 202022. And it's ait's an acute reminder of the risk firefighters bear and, quite frankly, of their bravery. You're the only ones who run toward flames and not away from them when that fire bell rings.
And youlook, you know, many of you heard me say before: First, God made man. Then he made a few firefighters. God made man, then he made a few firefighters.
I grew up in Claymont, Delaware. And acrossI went to a little school called Holy Rosary grade school across from the Claymont fire hall. And all my buddies, they cameeither became a firefighter, a cop, or a priest. I wasn't qualified for any of them, so here I am.
But[laughter]you know, it's truly amazing that an estimated 1,041,200 local and municipal firefighters65 percent of you are volunteers. And I'm proud to say in Delaware, in my home State, it's 98.3 percent of all firefighters are volunteer firefighters.
And by the way, I know you're all having trouble keepingbecause of COVID and because of the schedules people have these daysgettingattracting enough volunteers to man all the stations. You're the heart of the community.
You know, people don't appreciate you until they need you. But then they do, and you're always there.
Firefighters have saved my life and the life of my family. I want to just tell you for a momentI know a lot of you know fromif anyone's from Delaware there knowsyou know, way back in 1972, before I got sworn in, my familymy wife was Christmas shopping with my three children and a tractor trailerthey got in an accidentbroadsided, and killed my wife, killed my daughter. And my two boys, who were then almost 3 and almost 4, were on top of their dead sister and mother. And it took the Jaws of Life from my local fire department volunteers to get them out and get them to the hospital. And it saved their lives.
In addition to that, what happened wasI was doing ""Meet the Press,"" and lightning struck a little pond behind my house, came up through the ground, into the air conditioning system. Ended up generating this thick, black smoke literallyliterally thatof those proportions. And from the basement to the third floor, the attic, everything was ruined. And the kitchen floorwe almost lost a couple firefighters, they tell me, because the kitchen floor wastheburning between beams in the house, in addition to almost collapsed into the basement.
And then I wasI got rushed to the hospital for ait turned out to be almost a 9-hour operation with a cranial aneurismin the middle of a snowstorm by my fire company. They got me down. They saved my life. And so I owe you. And so many other Americans owe you as well, so many families.
The only thing that saves lives of a firefighter are more firefighters. The only thing that saves lives of a firefighter are more firefighters. That's why, as a Senator and as awhen I was out of office and then back as President, we do everything we can to support and pay for firefightersmore firefighters.
You know, and you're there for most people who've just lost everything. And by the wayagain, to ad-lib a second hereIyou know, you're alsowhat people don't realize, you're the same folks who are there holding the boot in the corner to raise money for the people who just lost their home. Not a joke. That's what you do. That's what you do.
You're the ones who line the Little League fields. You're the oneyou're justanyway, you're an incredible group of individuals.
You know, in Delaware, we used to sayback when I first started running as a kid, I'd say, ""There's three parties in Delaware: Democrats, Republicans, and firefighters."" Thank God I had the firefighters.
I just got off with the president of the Delaware volunteer fire company who said, ""Joe, do you remember I was in your first campaign in 1972?"" [Laughter]
Anyway, you're on the front lines for emergencies and disasters all across this great Nation, from the devastating wildfires in the West to the thousands of fires that local firefighters respond to every day, and response to Hurricane Ian in Southwest Florida.
And by the way, I point out that I've flown over just this last 18 monthsflown over most of the major fires in the West. More timber, more housing has burned to the ground than all of the landmass in the State of New Jersey. That's how much has been lost.
And you know, I went down to Florida to seekin response last week, firefighters helped rescue thousands of survivors and answered the callnot just for fires, just answered the call. And in some cases, their own homes and firehouses were damaged, destroyed, or washed away. Because that's who you are. When tragedy strikes, you suit up.
And when the impacts of climate change are becoming increasingly evident, we're calling on you more and more and more. Extreme heat and prolonged drought have turned wildfire season into wildfire years. And local firefighters are being called in more to respond to the fires in the wildland-urban interface where we're moving out into the forest areas to develop and it becomes local and Federal.
So I want you to know that my administration is doing everything we can to make sure you have the resources you need to do your job as safely and effectively and efficiently as possible.
You know, we invested $350 billion in the American Rescue Plan to help States and localStates and cities keep first responders on the job, including firefighters on the job whenduring COVID-19. And between the American Rescue Plan and my 2023 budget request, we've increased Federal firefighting grants by $320 million, which includes money to fund 1,200 more local firefighters in the field, hundreds more emergency response vehicles, and thousandsthousands of sets of turnout gear. A pioneer in research on issues fromincluding like cancer prevention.
You know, it's close to my heart. Cancer is a leading killer of firefighters. Toxic substances you've been exposed to as part of your job are almost certainlycertainly connected to those cancer diagnoses. And we're doingwe're going to do something about it. The Cancer Moonshot is bringing together every part of our Government to cut cancer death rates in half and to end cancer as we know it, including by addressing environmental and toxic exposures to prevent cancer.
We just passed national legislationnational legislation to deal with the burn pits in Afghanistan and Iraq, andthat so many of our soldierswe finally got it passed so that we can care for their families if they've beenlost their lives or care for them, in fact, if theyif they're going through this. We created a special claims unit at the Department of Labor to ensure that they're processing Federal firefighters' cancer claims quickly.
And we're also taking [tackling]* PFASthe so-called forever chemicals that for years have been in your gear, your equipment, and the suppression agents that you depend on to do your job. I'm determinedI'm absolutely determinedto make sure you have the gear that protects you without making you or your family sick.
And I'm urging Congress to send to my desk the Federal Firefighters Fairness Actlet me say it again: the Federal Firefighters Fairness Actwhich are going to help Federal firefighters and their families assess critical worker compensation resources, including making sure that several forms of cancer are presumed to be causedpresumed to be causedby the firefighter's job.
And I'm also proud that last November, I signed into law Protecting America's First Responders Act, which extends the benefits under the Public Safety Officers' Death Benefits Program to the families of firefighters killed in training and made it easier to qualify for permanent disability.
The final pointI'm sorry to go on so long, but I feel passionately about this. The final point I'd like to make today is that we're doing everything we can to ease the burden on our firefighters by preventing fires. This is the 100thhard to believeit's the 100th anniversary of Fire Prevention Week. And the landmark legislation I've signed into law includes historic investments to reduce the risk of fire.
The bipartisan infrastructure law includes significant forest management, increases community resilience andto wildfires, and harnesses new technologies to keep communities safe. It's also repairing vital infrastructure andfirefighters and other first responders rely on to quickly get to theto those in need.
By the way, we're talking about theall the bridges that are in tough shape. I was out in Western Pennsylvania. There was a fire station, a bridge over a creek, and a school not far from there. They have to goI think it was 7 miles, if thatthey couldn't go across the bridge because it wasn't strong enough to maintain andexcuse mehandle the firetruck.
You know, the Inflation Reduction Act enables us to take unprecedented steps to confront climate crisis, which is going to protect forest health, reduce fire risk, and supercharge our clean energy future.
We're also maximizing protections for people when fires do break out, through a national initiative to help States, local, and Tribal and territorial governments adapt and adopt the most up-to-date building codes that reflect the threats from the climatefrom climate change.
We're using the Department of Defense satellite imagery to detect wildfires in their early stages so firefighters have a better chance to suppress the fires early before they can impact on local communities. And we're working to help itwe're working to help educate the public on basic fire safety, like preparing fire escape plans, testing smoke and carbon monoxide alarms monthly and replacing those alarms every 10 years. This is the simple steps we can take to save lives.
Look, on behalf of my own family and every American, I just want to close by saying again: Thank you, thank you, thank you. Fires will always be a fact of human life. And when the worst happens, when those alarms go off, when everything and everybody you love is in danger, there's no better sight in the world than that firefighter who's ready to go to work.
So thank you for being who you are. Thank you for all the heroes you represent. You are on the alert and on call in communities all across this country right now as I speak.
So God bless you all, and may God protect our firefighters. Thank you for letting me have a chance to talk to you. I wish II literally do wish I were there with you. Thank you. Thank you, Lori.

2022-10-07 00:00:00,"Remarks at the Volvo Group Powertrain Operations Manufacturing Facility in Hagerstown, Maryland","
Please, have a seat. Thank you very much.
Let me start off with two words: Made in America. Made in America. And that's not hyperbole. I'm not joking about that, as you know.
And I want to say upfrontand the management here understands, and I'm proud of them: I'm a union guy. And I tell you what: I made it real clear to everybody, when speaking to the National Chamber of Commerce or the Business Roundtable, the reason I'm the most pro-union President in American history is because you're the single best workers in the world. Not a joke.
You know, a lot of people think that you just show up and you got a job. How about those 3, 4, or 5 years, sometimes, of apprentice work that you, in fact, are getting fullit's like going back to school. And so what I've seen happen now is, they're figuring outeverybody is figuring out that the supply chain and only on-time purchases is a big problem. Now we're figuring it out: If it's made in America, we're going toand invented in America, it's made in America.
And so, look, I want to thank you, Sam, for that introduction.
And thank you, Mayor Keller, for welcoming us to your city and for getting your two kids you got to get dressed on a Friday to come and see me. [Laughter] I don'tI hope they'll forgive me for that. [Laughter]
And it's great to be with Congressman David Trone who is always, always, always working for the working people of this district on mental health and addiction and support of our veterans, and modernizing our infrastructure like expanding I-81, which is going to be expanded because of him.
And I want to commend the terrific leaders who couldn't be here today: Steny Hoyer, who leads the Democrats in the House, and Senators Cardin and Van Hollen who are close and dear friends.
And look, I want to thank Donna Edwards from the Maryland State Federation of Labor and all the proud members of the United Auto Workers here today.
This is National Manufacturing Day, and this is starting to mean something again. National Manufacturing Day, when we celebrate workers who are the backbone of the economy of this country. Not a joke. Where is it written that it says ""America can't be the leading manufacturer in the world again""? Where is that written?
I'm here at this Volvo plant to thank the workers and management for building heavy-duty engines, transmissions, axles for trucks and buses and parts of electric vehicles of the future.
And like the United Steelworkers at the cement plant here in Hagerstown, who are manufacturing cleaner cement for our Nation's roads and highwayspeople don't even realize how much cementthe ordinarythe way it's made causes environmental problems. The older, dirtier cement accounts for 7 percent of global emissions. Well, guess what? Clean cement makes a gigantic difference.
And like all the workers I met yesterday at the IBM plant in Poughkeepsie, New York, where they're investing $20 billion in manufacturing advanced quantum computers here in the United States again. Here in the United States. And the workers in Syracuse, where the company Micron is investing $100 billion to manufacture computer chips, the biggest investment of its kind in America, biggest investment ever in the world.
And we all know it's been 4 or 5 years in this countrythe last 4 or 5a lot of things have been tough for people. A lot of things have been tough, and they're still tough for many. But there's also a bright spot where America is reasserting its power, where America is reassertingAmericans are reasserting themselves.
Where is it written, as I said, that America can't lead the world in manufacturing again? We already createdwe've already created over 628or 38,000 manufacturing jobs just since I've been President, because we're making it happen right here in America. Companies are investing in America, and we're all making sure government delivers: the infrastructure law, the CHIPS and Science Act.
I don't know about you, but as my dad used to say, people justthey're worried about getputting three squares on a table every day, and not having to deal with all the politics that are going on. And all theallso who should know the names of these pieces of legislation? But we made a historic Government investment in America, and it's spurring incredible private-sector investment in America.
If I could divert for just a second: We had a piece of legislation thatled by your Congressman that, in fact, says that we're going to invest $368 billion in dealing with the environment.
Although a major article in a majormajor publication yesterday of thefrom industry: that's generating $1.7 billion [trillion]* in investment. Because guess what? We give a tax credit to somebody, and guess what? Companies want to build that productbuild that productbecause it's goinga billion [trillion]* seven hundred million [billion]* dollars. Meaning, literally, hundreds of thousands of new jobs. Not a joke. Not a joke.
All across America, we're proving ""Made in America"" isn't just a slogan, it's reality. We're proving that our best days are ahead of us, not behind us. Just look at today's jobs report. Our economy created 263,000 jobs last month. That's 10 million jobs since I've come into office. That's the fastest job growth at any point of any President in all of American history. Historic progress.
The unemployment rate remains at historic low, 3.5-percent unemployment. That includes the lowest unemployment among Hispanic Americans ever in the history of this country and the second lowest employment of Black teenagers ever. And this recovery has been the fastest increase of people reentering the workforce of any modern economic recovery.
But there's something else. Our job market continues to show resilience as we navigate through this economic transition we're in. For some time, I've been saying that what we need to do in this transition, we have to move from historically strong economic recovery to a more steady, stable recovery.
We need to bring inflation down without giving up all the historic economic progress that working class and middle class people have made. And that's exactly what we're seeing.
Over the past 4 months, we've createdwe've createdan average of 350,000 jobs a month. That's down from the 450,000 jobs a month priorin the prior 4 months and down from the 600,000 jobs a month the 4 months before that. The pace of job growth is cooling while still powering our recovery forward.
Wage growth for workers remains solid, down from the historic high pace months ago but still growing for workers who deserve a raise. And this is the progress we need to see.
In the short term, a transition to a more stable growth that continues to deliver for workers and families while bringing inflation down, in the long term, the economy built on a firmer foundation.
We still have a lot of work to do, but we're building a different economy than before: a better one, a stronger one, not trickle-down economy. That never helped my family very much in Claymont, ""trickle down."" This is an economy built on building from the middle out and the bottom up, not from the top down. And when that happens, everyone does well. The poor have a ladder up, the middle class do well, and the wealthy do very well; they're not hurt at all.
That's an economic vision I offered to America when I ran and I'm pushing on. And that's what I want to talk about today, and how we haveour Republican colleagues have a very different view. And I know many of you are probably Republicans, but many of my Republican friends are basically arguing that good news for the economy is bad newsis bad newsfor America, as if they're rooting for fewer jobs and lower wages.
It's all a part of this trickle-down mentality that says it doesn't matter what's happening on Main Street; what really matters is what's happening on Wall Street. If Wall Street is doing well, everybody is doing well. Well, I noticed that the lastthe previous 4 years, we weren't doing that well, and Wall Street was doing well. And then that hadtook a tumble.
That's not my plan. We can continue to grow our economy in a stable and sustainable way. We can build on an economy that works for everyone.
And today we're going to do something that our Republican colleagues in the Congress don't wantdon't want us to do. They love to attack the Democrats. They say webutfor what we've done. But they really don't want to see what their plan is. I doubt any of you can tell me what the Republican reelection plan is this time out. What's their platform if they take control of Congress?
Let's start with inflation. Let me tell you how I think about it. I think about it the way my dad used to talk about it. My dad was a well-read guy. His greatest regret: He never went to college. He had to leave Scranton because, when coal died, everything died with it, and we moved down to Claymont, Delaware, a little steel town at the time.
Andbut it's the way most people at home deal with these things. You talk about it around the kitchen table: ""Do we have enough money to cover all the bills for the month and all the necessities that aren't regular bills?"" ""And if we do that, do we have a little bit of breathing room?""my dad used to say. Just a little bit of breathing room after that's done, where you don't have to worry.
Well, that's what we're trying to do: give families a little bit of breathing room. And that's what we've done. We passed the Inflation Reduction Actwhich the name doesn't matter a lot to peoplebut it's going to give Medicare, which a lot of us have been fighting for, the power to negotiate lower prescription drug prices.
We pay the highest drug prices of any developed nation in the world. It's going to limit out-of-pocket costs for people on Medicare, no matter what their drugas you know, some who have cancer, their drug costs are 14-, 15,000 dollars a year, literally, for the drugs they need.
Well, prescription drugs for seniors cannot exceed $2,000 a year, even if it's 10-, 20-, 30,000 dollars that they owe. It can't exceed $2,000 a year. And it's going to cap the cost of insulin for seniors on Medicare to $35 a month instead of 30 times that.
How many of you know somebody who has type 2 diabetes and needs that insulin? Well, guess what? It costs a whole hell of a lot. A lot of money. And it costs a lot of money for children.
I was in Virginia not long ago, and a woman stood up and said, ""I have two kids with type 2 diabetes. And we have to split the""""We have to break up what we have. We don't have enough money."" Because they didn't have the insurance; they weren't covered. And guess what? Well, how docan you look at your child knowing that they have type 2 diabetes and there's nothing you can do about it? Not a joke. This is the United States of America, for God's sake.
Well, Ithe bill I producedI introduced said we're going to reduce the cost of insulin. And by the way, it costs, to make that insulinit costs $10 to make it and to package it. Ten. T-E-N. Ten dollars. And they're charging as high as 650, 700 dollars a month for it.
Well, the original bill I introduced said we're going to take care of everybody who's on insulin. My friends on the other team were able to get enough votes to knock out that for anybody but for the seniors.
You know, we've locked in savings in health care premiums for a million of the people on the Affordable Care Act. You know, one of the things that people forget is, without the Affordable Care Act, anybody who had a preexisting condition could not get insurance. Let me say it again: You could not get insurance if you didn't have a whole hell of a lot of money to buy a private policy. Well, it guarantees that people with preexisting conditions can have insurance.
We're making it possible for families to save thousands of dollars in energy savings with the legislation we have, which, as I said, it's going to bring a trillion-seven off the market investing in other jobs.
And, folks, for the first time in a long time, we're going to make sure the biggest corporations begin to pay their fair share of Federal taxes with a minimum tax rate of 15 percent. In 2020, of the Fortune 500 companies, 52 made $40 billion and didn't pay a single penny in taxes. I come from the corporate State of the world, across the border, in Delaware. I know corporations. I got elected six times there. But everybody should be paying something. Everybody should be paying something.
And we're doing all this while reducing the deficit. My friends talkon the other teamtalk about how we're ""big spenders."" Well, guess what? They passed a $2 trillion tax cut for the top 1 percent, basically, and corporate America, and didn't pay for a penny of it.
My first year in office, we reduced the Federal debt by $350 billion350. And this year, we're reducing it by more than $1 trillion while we're doing all the things we're doing. And allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices is going to reduce it, over the next 10 years, another $300 billion over the next decade.
Every single Democrat voted for the Inflation Reduction Act. And every single Republican voted against it. Not only that, they're telling us that the number-one priority is to repealif they win, they're saying they're going to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act if they gain control of the Congress.
Let's be crystal clear what that means: Republicans take control of the Congress means the power we just gave Medicare to negotiate drug prices goes away. Gone. Prices will go back up. If Republicans take control of the Congress, that $2,000 cap on prescription drug costs we just passed goes away. Gone. If they take back the control of the Congress, the $35-a-month cap on insulin for folks on Medicare we just passed goes away. Gone. The savings on health care premiums we just got for a million Americans, for the Affordable Care Act, gone.
And of course, it's not just the Inflation Reduction Act they want to get rid of. They still want to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. That means an end to protection for millions of people with preexisting conditions who rely on the Affordable Care Act. Gone.
Now, when it comes to taxes, if Republicans get their way, they're going to get rid of the corporate minimum tax. They're not talking about getting rid of your taxes, but the corporate minimum tax. The biggest corporations can go back to paying zero in Federal income tax.
These are facts. Check them out.
And, folks, it's not just the Inflation Reduction Act; they're coming after your Social Security and Medicare as well. I know that sounds bizarre, but look it up.
The Senator in charge of electing Republicans in the U.S. Senate this year has proposed a plan to put Social Security and Medicare on the chopping block every 5 years. That means every 5 years, Congress is going to have to vote to either cut, reduce, completely eliminate, or vote for Medicare and Social Security again.
What do you think is going to happen? What do you think? But that's not enough. You've been paying into Social Security and Medicare since you started working when you were 16 years old.
And then there's the Senator from Wisconsin, Ron Johnson. He thinks waiting 5 years is too long. And he says Social Security and Medicare should be on the chopping block every single year. If Congress doesn't vote to keep it, it goes away. Affirmative vote to keep it. You know the games they can play in Congress, from theeverything from thedealing with needing 60 votes in the Senate and so on.
And it's not just Social Security and Medicare. He wants to put everything on the Federal budget. Veterans' benefits would have to come up every single year.
It's not justthis morning I sawthere's a report. You guys can, as they sayas my grandkids say, ""Google it."" [Laughter] But the report that came out on CNN, it says, ""Republicans called Biden infrastructure program 'Socialism.' And then they asked for the money."" And it goes through all the Republicans whothe most conservative Republicans who call it socialism and how they're asking for it.
A guy named Paul Gosar, he's written three separate letters to the administration asking for projects in his district. He says they'd enhance the quality of life, they'd eased congestion, boost the economy. He voted against it; says it's all socialism.
Go down the list. Kentucky Representative Andy Barr: The biggest ""socialist agenda."" Three different projects he wants, citing the importance of the safety and growth of his district. Rand Paul. I can go down the list. Look it up.
""Socialism."" I didn't know there were that many socialist Republicans. [Laughter] Think about it. I'm serious. Let's get serious about taking care of ordinary peopleregular people like I grew up. Folks, look, you can't make this stuff up. You've got to sayand I've got to say, I was surprised to see so many Socialists in the Republican caucus. [Laughter]
And, folks, here's the bottom line: If Republicans take control of the Congress, these historic victories we just won for the American people are going to be taken away. Every kitchen table cost is going to go up, not down. And I realize costs are going up on food.
And I was able to bring gasoline down well over $1.60, but it's inching up because of what the Russians and the Saudis just did. I'm not finished with that yet.
The cost of your prescription drugs and health care, energythey're allthey'll all go up. Your protection for preexisting conditions are taken away. Your Social Security and Medicare are going to be in the chopping block. But they don't want you to know that. They're not campaigning on it, but that's what they are saying. That's the documents they're sending out.
Folks, when it comes to the next Congress, this isn't a referendum, it's a choice. It's a choice between two very different ways of looking at the economy. You've got over 200-some people in the Congress who still think the last election wasn't fair, that it was stolen, I stole the election, even though every major Republican judge and the Supreme Court said: ""No, no, there's no evidence of any of that. None."" But I ""stole"" the election.
Folks, you know, we talk about democracy, whether it's at risk. Well, democracy is at risk in most places when the only definition of whether you win: You either have to win the election or it's been stolen. When, in fact, you havewhen you havein fact, you're in a situation where, you know, a group of people attack the Capitol like we've never seensmash down the doors, go after people, have three cops end up dying, so on and so forth. And they're referred to as ""patriots""? Patriots? That's democracy?
Well, look, there's different ways of looking at our country. One is to view it from Park Avenue, which saysit helps the very wealthy and maybe it will trickle down to everyone else. If Park Avenue is doing well, we're all doing well.
The other view is from Scranton, Pennsylvania, where I grew up, or view it here in Hagerstownthe belief that the backbone of Americathat people will get up every single morning and go to work and break their necks in making a living. The working class and the middle class, that's who built this country. And by the way, the middle class built America, and unions built the middle class. For real. And, folks, that's who our economy should work for.
Let me close with this. The last few years, we've faced some of the most difficult challenges in our history, but we're making real progress helping folks just a little bit more and giving them a little bit more breathing room. We just have to keep going, and I know we can.
For everything we've been through, I've never been more optimistic about America's prospects in my entire career. My word: I've never been more optimistic. Just remember who in the hell we are. We're the United States of America. There's nothingnothingwe've ever set our mind to we've not been able to do. Nothing!
And, folks, nothing is beyond the capacity if we work together. And so that's my hope: that after this election, there will be a little return to sanity. We'll stop this bitterness that exists between the parties and have people working together.
Because I tell you what: We can own the 21st century. Not a joke. We can own. There's not a single other nation in the worldnot a single other nation in the worldas well positioned as the United States of America is. And it's because of you all.
Thank you very much. May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thanks.

2022-09-07 00:00:00,Remarks on the Unveiling of the Official Portraits of Former President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama,"
President Biden. Thank you. [Applause] Thank you, thank you, thank you. [Applause] Thank you. Whoa is right. Thank you all very much. Please. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Please.
Thank you, John Rogers and the White House Historical Society.
Barack and Michelle, welcome home. [Laughter] Welcome home.
Jill and I and Kamala and Doug are honored to host you and so many friends who have been part of this incredible journey. It includes members of your Cabinet and staff, some of whom were foolish enough to come work with me. [Laughter]
And Iand there's someone else that I'd like to acknowledge tonight: Mrs. Robinson. This is your house as well. [Applause] Thank you. It's good toit's good to see you again, Mom. [Laughter] It really is.
And it's also good see Ms. Wilson, whoknown affectionately as ""Mama Kaye."" One of your best friends, and Malia and Sasha's godmother. And as they say in Southern Delaware, ""You done good, kid."" [Laughter]
And President Kennedy once observed that ""Every President must endure the gap between what he would like and what is possible."" He was right. The history books are full of stories about Presidents trying to bridge that gap, stories that include the burdens of the office, the difficult decisions, how the work is always serious and often solemn.
And all of that's true. But so is this: With Barack as our President, we got up every day and went to work full of hopefor real; full of purpose; and excited about the possibility before us. There are few people I've ever known with more integrity, decency, and moral courage than Barack Obama.
And, Mr. President, nothing could have prepared me better or more to become President of the United States than being at your side for 8 years, and I mean that from the bottom of my heart.
You know, no matter what the issue was, no matter how difficult, no matter what it was about, doing ityou never did what itjust the easy waywhat the easy way out was. It was never about doing it that way. It was always about doing what was right, literally.
You know, just go down the list of historic Presidencies. He never gave up on the simple truth that health care was a right for all Americans. When so many were telling himincluding me, at one point[laughter]""Take the compromise. Take the compromise""we weren't sure we could get anything done on ACA""Think about the compromise""you refused. You went big. And now the Affordable Care Act is there permanently, and it's even being improved on.
Because I remember what you told me. You said, ""How can I look those people in the eye and leave anybody behind?"" You weren't about to do that.
You know, his Recovery Act brought America back from a Great Recession.
The auto rescue protected an iconic industry that represents the Nation's heart and soul. And there were a whole lot of people, some maybe even in this room, that were telling you we should let the industry go bankrupt; we should let it go. But you wouldn't. You persisted. You insisted. And I remember our conversations. And I'm proudI'm proudwe stood together and wouldn't let that happen. You bet on the American worker. You believed in the American worker.
Even though he knew it would be controversial, you stood up for hundreds of thousands of ""dreamers""dreamerswho have only known America as their home. It always boggles my mind that others can't understand that a 3-year-old kid is going to say: ""No, Mom, leave me on the side of the Rio Grande. You go ahead and go."" I'm serious. Youso they could stay and contribute. And they've contributed incredibly their talents. And it's a great generation they represent.
I can go on and defend whatall that you've done: expanding civil rights, issuing the clarion call on the climate crisis. Helped us find that amazing gracethat amazing graceeven in darkness. In countless hours, over countless meetings, under intense pressure, we always knew Barack Obamawe always knew what you'd do, youwhat you thought was right, even if it was going to cost you politically.
You know, we trusted himall of you in this room. We believed in him. And we counted on him. And I still do. And I still do. And, folks, Mr. Presidentthat's why the country elected you twice. And it's why you'll be considered one of the most consequential Presidents in our history, along with one of the most consequential First Ladies.
You know, Michelle, he knows, we all know: He couldn't have done it without you. I know I couldn't. [Laughter] In fact, during our weekwe had lunch once a week every week come hell or highwater. And everybody wondered all those important things we talked about. Probably 40 percent of the time, we talked about family. We most talked about our girls and my grandchildren and my children.
You embody dignity beyond measure, Michelle. And together, you and Barack made history. You both generated hope for millions of people who were left behind for so long. And it matters. You both did it with such grace and such class.
You know, you dreamed big and secured lasting wins for the American people, helping lift their burden with the blessing of hope. It was so underestimated, the notion of just having hope. This is a gift of the Obama Presidency to the country and to history. And it's a gift I felt personally.
And as we used to say in the Senate, Mr. President, excuse a point of personal privilege[laughter]you were always there. I rememberI remember how you were with me when mywhen our son was passing, and I remember the eulogy you gave in his behalf. You'll never fully understand just how much it meant to Jill and me and the entire family.
I always remember that night we accepted the nomination in Denver. Imy granddaughter Finnegan, who's a great friend of your daughters, atcalled and came up to the roomour roomand said, ""Pop, can we move the beds out of my room?""
And I said, ""Why do you want move the beds out of your room?"" And she said, ""Well, so""her two sisters and Malia and Sasha""we could all get sleeping bags and lie on the floor and sleep together and watch the convention on the floor."" That image of them all together will stay with me forever. And I think it melded our families in ways that it's hard for other people to understand.
For 8 years, we grew to be a family for each other, through our highs and our lows. A family from different backgrounds brought together by a shared value set. And all the things that the families have done together isI imagine there may have been other relationships like thisPresident and Vice Presidentbut I can't think ofnone comes to mind.
Jill and I have been waiting to host events at the White House for a long time, coming out of the pandemic. [Laughter] And it's fittingfittingthat we can do that now by unveiling the portraits of two dear friends and two great Americans who are still held very tightly in the hearts of the American people, portraits that are going to hang on the walls of this sacred place, the people's house, forever; and a reminder of all here and now, for those to come to power, that hope and change matters.
Barack and Michelle, it's my honor to invite you both to the stage for the unveiling of your official portraits. Come on up.
[At this point, former President Obama and former First Lady Obama came to the stage.]
Former President Obama. Hey! All right. Are we ready? Yes? [Laughter] Okay. There we go.
[The portraits were unveiled.]
Former President Obama. Thank you so much. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Thank you! Thank you so much. Please, everybody, have a seat. Have a seat. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Sit down, everybody. Thank you very much.
It is great to be back. [Laughter] President and Dr. Biden, Vice President Harris and Second Gentleman Emhoff, thank you so much for your hospitality. Thanks for letting us invite a few friends to the White House. [Laughter] We will try not to tear up the place. [Laughter]
Someone[laughter]someone once said that if you're looking for a friend in Washington, get a dog. [Laughter] Our family was lucky enough to have two wonderful dogs. But I was even luckier to have a chance to spend 8 years working day and night with a man who became a true partner and a true friend.
Joe, it is now America's good fortune to have you as President. You've guided us[applause]. You have guided us through some perilous times. You've built on and gone beyond the work we all did together to expand health care, to fight climate change, to advance social justice, and to promote economic fairness.
Thanks to your decency and thanks to your strengthmaybe most of all, thanks to your faith in our democracy and the American peoplethe country is better off than when you took office, and we should all be deeply grateful for that. So thank you so much. [Applause]
To all the former Obama-Biden staffers who are here in person, some of you are watching at home, thank you for being a part of this. When people ask me what I miss most about the White House years, it is not Air Force One that I talk about. Although, I miss Air Force One. [Laughter] It's the chance that I had to stand shoulder to shoulder with all of you; to have a chance to witness so many talented, selfless, idealistic, good people working tirelessly every day to make the world better.
And for 8 years, and even longer for some of you, I drew on your energy and your dedication and your goodness. You inspired me, and I never wanted to disappoint you. And I tried to reflect the same heart and character that you displayed every day. Even during the toughest times, it was all of you that kept me going. So it's good to be back to have a chance to see all of you and to, once again, say thank you.
Now, as much as I miss our work together, what's been a special joy is to see what's happened since, because so many of you are doing amazing things, whether it's in government, in the private sector, in academia, or nonprofits.
And I'm especially glad to see so many of you serving President Biden as well as you served mealthough, now some of you who, let's face it, you were kids back then, are now in charge and running the show[laughter]which is a little shocking[laughter]and may also explain some of the gray hairs I'm seeing on some of you. [Laughter] But it validates what I had always hoped, which was that our time together would only be the beginning of incredibly impactful careers.
And some of you who I've had a chance to stay in touch with, I'm thrilled to see that you've started families of your own. I am a little disappointed that I haven't heard of anyone naming a kid ""Barack"" yet.
Former First Lady Obama. Or Michelle.
Former President Obama. Or Michelle. [Laughter] But there is still time. [Laughter]
Finally, I want to say a special thanks to the White House staff. We had a chance to see them all beforehand. [Applause] Yes, yes. You took incredible care of our family for 8 years. And along the way, you became a part of it. And we have not ever forgotten the kindness that you showed us.
Now, when Michelle and I had our portraits unveiled at the National Portrait Gallery a few years back, I said that, as far as I could tell, no one in my family tree had ever sat for a portrait before. [Laughter] I certainly had not. And now, all of a sudden, we've done it twice.
But these portraits today have a special significance, because, as Joe mentioned, they will hang in the White House alongside portraits of other Presidents and First Ladies dating back to George and Martha. So it was important to find the right people to paint them.
I want to thank Sharon Sprung for capturing everything I love about Michelleher grace, her intelligence, and the fact that she's fine. [Laughter] I'm just saying. She is. Her portrait is stunning.
And I want to thank Robert McCurdy for taking on a much more difficult subject[laughter]and doing a fantastic job with mine. Robert is known for his paintings of public figures: Toni Morrison, the Dalai Lama, Nelson Mandela, Muhammad Ali. But what I love about Robert's work is that he paints people exactly the way they are, for better or worse. [Laughter] He captures every wrinkle on your face, every crease in your shirt. [Laughter]
You'll note that he refused to hide any of my gray hairs. [Laughter] Refused my request to make my ears smaller. [Laughter] He also talked me out of wearing a tan suit, by the way. [Laughter] So[laughter].
His work is so precise that, at first glance, it looks like a photograph. And Robert also paints his subjects looking straight ahead, so it feels like you're face to face, forming a connection. And that appealed to me, in part because Presidents so often get airbrushed. They even take on a mythical status, especially after you've gone and people forget all the stuff they didn't like about you. [Laughter]
But what you realize when you're sitting behind that desk, and what I want people to remember about Michelle and me, is that Presidents and First Ladies are human beings like everyone else. We have our gifts. We have our flaws. You've all experienced mine. [Laughter] We have good days and bad days. We feel the same joy and sadness, frustration and hope. And while it takes a certain amount of self-confidence to be President, there are nights where we lie awake wondering if this or that decision was the right one.
I've always described the Presidency as a relay race. You take the baton from someone, you run your leg as hard and as well as you can, and then you hand it off to someone else, knowing that your work will be incomplete. The portraits hanging in the White House chronicle the runners in that race, each of us tasked with trying to bring the country we love closer to its highest aspirations.
And when future generations walk these halls and look up at these portraits, I hope they get a better, honest sense of who Michelle and I were. And I hope they leave with a deeper understanding that if we could make it here, maybe they can too; they can do remarkable things too.
Now, it is my pleasure to introduce someone who needs no introduction. [Laughter] Michelle was the best thing about living in the White House. And let me tell you, the pastry chefs here deliver delicious pies on request[laughter]so that is saying something. [Laughter]
I could not ask for a better life partner, and in my humble opinion, America could not have asked for a better First Lady. Please give it up for Michelle Obama.
Former First Lady Obama. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, guys. [Applause] Okay, thank you, everybody.
Oh, well, let me thank my husband, first of all, for such spicy remarks. [Laughter]
Former President Obama. I'm not running again!
Former First Lady Obama. And of course, thank you to Joe and Jill, President Biden and First Lady Jill Biden. Thank you for inviting us back. This means so much to us.
We were saying at lunch that the girls have lived in this house longer than they've lived anywhere. And so this, as odd of a home as this can be, as wonderful it canas it can beit is a special place because we raised our girls here. And it means so much to come back to friends and to be able to spend time talking about our girls.
And so I am grateful to both of you for the work that you're doing; the love that you're showing us, our staff; and the work that you're doing for this country. Thank you so much.
And of course, to Vice President Harris andI love to say thisSecond Gentleman Emhoff. [Laughter] Let's say it again: Second Gentleman. You're doing a great job. [Laughter] Thank you for joining us today.
And I can't go any further without, of course, acknowledging all of the amazing stafffriends. It'syou're more than staff. You're friends. You're family to us, particularly the people who have been a part of my team over the years.
I don't have time to name everyone, thank goodness. But you all knewknow who you are, from the campaign, to the White House, to today. I would not be who I am without your passion and your faith, and all the love that you poured into everything that we accomplished together. And it was amazing, historic.
What did Sam Kass used to say?
Audience member. Unprecedented!
Former First Lady Obama. Unprecedented. [Laughter]
You all mean the world to me. And I mean that from the bottom of my heart. So thank you. Proud of you. Proud of the work that you've done. Proud of what you're doing.
I also want to take the time to recognize the Residence staff. As Barack said, you guys made this a home. We snatched up a few of you all and took you with us. [Laughter] But for those of you who we couldn't bring, we miss you so much. We miss you so much. The best part about this house was you all. So it's so good to see you. And you all look goodso good. [Laughter]
I'd also like to recognize Stewart McLaurin; of course, John Rogers. It's been amazing working you all over the years. I have to recognize Bill Allman, who has been fabulous to work with over the years. And of course, Thelma Golden and my dear friend Michael Smith for theirwe are where we are because of their comprehensive and rigorous work to identify these incredible artists.
And that brings me to our artist. Of course, Robert McCurdy, whoyou know, you did a good job. [Laughter] You did a good job.
But I got to spend a lot of time with Sharon Sprung. And Sharon now joins a small but mighty group of women who have painted an official portrait here at the White House.
And I'm thrilled that this extraordinary work is going to be enshrined forever as part of our Nation's history.
But, Sharon, it was wonderful to work with you. You are a true spirit; that's one of the reasons why we connected. Your work is phenomenal, but it was your essence, your soul, the way you saw me, the way we interactedand it shows in this beautiful work. So thank you for your brilliance, your artistry, and your patience[laughter]in this process.
I remember I went to see the work in Brooklyn. And poor Sharon, because no one is supposed to know who the artists are. So her studio is her home. And so she had this piece in her home. You couldn't have guests over. [Laughter] You were frightened that it would get out. And you just wanted it out of your space. [Laughter] And every year, I thought about, she must be going crazy. [Laughter]
So thank you. Thank you so much. Let's give them both a round of applause.
Oh, believe it or not, it is still a bit odd for me to stand in this historic space, see this big, beautiful painting staring back at me. Growing up on Euclid Avenue, Mommy, I never could have imagined that any of this would be part of my story.
But even if it's all still a bit awkward for me, I do recognize why moments like these are important, why all of this is absolutely necessary. Traditions like this matter not just for those of us who hold these positions, but for everyone participating in and watching our democracy.
You see, the people, they make their voices heard with their vote. We hold an Inauguration to ensure a peaceful transition of power. Those of us lucky enough to serve work, as Barack said, as hard as we can for as long as we can, as long as the people choose to keep us here. And once our time is up, we move on.
And all that remains in this hallowed place are our good efforts and these portraits, portraits that connect our history to the present day, portraits that hang here as history continues to be made.
So, for me, this day is not just about what has happened. It's also about what could happen. Because a girl like me, she was never supposed to be up there next to Jacqueline Kennedy and Dolley Madison. She was never supposed to live in this house, and she definitely wasn't supposed to serve as First Lady.
Audience member. We love you, Michelle!
Former First Lady Obama. Love you back.
But I've always wondered: Where does that ""supposed to"" come from? Who determines it? And too often in this country, people feel like they have to look a certain way or act a certain way to fit in, that they have to make a lot of money or come from a certain group or class or faith in order to matter.
But what we're looking at todaya portrait of a biracial kid with an unusual name[laughter]and the daughter of a water pump operator and a stay-at-home momwhat we are seeing is a reminder that there's a place for everyone in this country.
Because as Barack said, if the two of us can end up on the walls of the most famous address in the world, then, again, it is so important for every young kid who is doubting themselves to believe that they can too.
That is what this country is about. It's not about blood or pedigree or wealth. It's a place where everyone should have a fair shot, whether you're a kid taking two buses and a train just to get to school; or a single mother who is working two jobs to put some food on the table; or an immigrant just arriving, getting your first apartment, forging a future for yourself in a place you dreamed of.
That's why, for me, this day isn't about me or Barack. It's not even about these beautiful paintings. It's about telling that fuller storya story that includes every single American in every single corner of the country so that our kids and grandkids can see something more for themselves.
And as much as some folks might want us to believe that that story has lost some of its shine, that division and discrimination and everything else might have dimmed its light, I still know deep in my heart that what we shareas my husband continues to sayis so much bigger than what we don't. Our democracy is so much stronger than our differences.
And this little girl from the South Side is blessed beyond measure to have felt the truth of that fuller story throughout her entire life, never more so than today.
So thank you to President Biden, to Sharon, and to all of you today for playing a part in this day and all the days that led to it.
And now, it is my privilege to introduce someone who is stepping in shoes and doing it well, someone who has devoted so much of her life to education, working to broaden the idea of whose story matters.
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome my friend, First Lady Dr. Jill Biden.
First Lady Jill T. Biden. Thank you. [Laughter] Joe, honestly? Everybody stood but Joe. [Laughter]
Thank you, Michelle, for a friendship I treasure. Fourteen years ago14 years ago, Michelleon a cold night in November, a sea of people gathered in Grant Park to be a part of history. There was laughter and music and dancing.
There were tears as friends and strangers alike held each other, overwhelmed with the joy that hope and change had been realized. The crowd roared, radiating the sense that anything we could dream was within our reach.
But at the heart of that enormous moment was a family: two little girls who would grow up exploring the secret halls and hideaways of the White House; a mom who would bring her whole heart to serving the American people as First Lady while still guiding and protecting her family with a ferocious devotion; a grandmother who would do absolutely anything for the family she loves and even move to Washington, DC. [Laughter] And a father who showed the world the meaning of ""Yes, we can.""
For Joe and me and our entire family, standing on that stage next to you was like waking up in a new world. A place where, with hard work, anything was possible. And it wasn't just the Bidens. So many of you were also there. You remember how it felt. It was magic, wasn't it?
That night, your family connected us all. And our familythe Obama-Biden team, every one of you who were ""fired up and ready to go""together we changed the course of this country forever.
And when I look at these portraits, I see familyyour family, the family we all built, and the families across America that we served together. I see love, joy, and fellowship. And we are honored to hang them today and share them with the world.
So thank you for being with us. And now, please join us in the State Dining Room for a reception. Thank you for being here.

2022-09-06 00:00:00,Remarks Prior to a Cabinet Meeting and an Exchange With Reporters,"
The President. Everybody in?
White House aide. Yes, sir.
The President. Okay, well, it's good for all of us to be together. We're meeting today at an incredibly important time in the country, to state the obvious. And, over the past 10 months, we've won passage of some, I think, extraordinary parts of our economic agenda: the bipartisan infrastructure law, the biggest infrastructure package since the Eisenhower administration, with the help of some of our friends on the other side of the aisle.
The CHIPS Act, a law that will spur investments and microchipswhich I might point out were invented here in the United States of America and refined. But the CHIPS Act is a gigantic investment, and it's going to create a number of jobs and technologies for the future.
The Inflation Reduction Act. The law brings down the cost of prescription drugs, health premiumshealth care premiums, and invests in a ""Made in America"" and a clean energy future.
And the three things, along with other steps we've taken like the American Rescue Plan, student debt relief, andis proof that democracy can deliver for the people.
And there's a foundation of the kind of strong, forward-looking economy that we want to continue to build: the economy with lower prices, more breathing room for middle class families; an economy with good-paying jobs you can raise a family on and just have, as I said, just a little bit of breathing room, whether you went to college or not; an economy that leads the world in technology and clean energy; and an economy that ends our dependence on foreign sources across the entire supply chain.
And so this economy that works for the country from the bottom up and the middle outas I said from the beginning, I'm not a big fan of trickle-down economics; I find it'sthe trickle stops fairly quickly coming down. [Laughter] But when thewhen working folks are doing well and the middle class is doing well, the wealthy do very well. Everybody does well.
And so today I've assembled the Cabinet to lay out in detail how we're going to implement each of these laws that you worked so hard to get passed and we've gotten passed, and because passing these historic bills is only the first step in delivering for the American people. But it's just thatit's a first step.
And I've asked each relevant Cabinet agency to come forward today with a plan to help get the American people and our economy on the right side as fast as possible and to spend taxpayers' money wisely.
I might add, with all these legislations we've passed, Madam Vice President, that we've still reduced the deficit substantially in our first year, over $300 billion. And this year, it's estimated to be somewhere in excess of a trillion five hundred billion and maybe as much as a trillion seven hundred billion.
Soand you know, we're going to spend the money wisely to buy American.
For example, we're going to lower the cost of prescription drugs by letting Medicare negotiate prices with the drug companies. I've beenwe've been proposing that for a long time. Andbut Pharma is a tough opponent on these issues, and we finally got that legislation through.
We're going to reduce the cost of health insurance under the Affordable Care Act because of actions we've taken in the pastabout $800 a premium this yeara person this year. And we're going to hire more teachers.
We're going to create millions of good-paying jobs, union jobs in manufacturing. I know it's not always the casenot everyone, even my own team, necessarily agrees with mebut I don't know where it's written that we can't be a manufacturing center for the world. We've created over 600,000 manufacturing jobs, and I think we're going to continue.
Just last week, major companies announced billions in new investments to make new solar panels here in the United States; fiber optic cables in the United States; electric cars, computer chips here in the United States. And we're going to be employing American workers and using American products.
On Friday, I'm going to be going to the groundbreaking of a new state-of-the-art semiconductor facility in Ohiothe biggest investment of its kind ever in our Nation. And we're finally bringing home jobs that have been overseas for a while. I notice some of the Cabinet members are smiling, but we're doing it, right? [Laughter] And we're making things here in America. We're making our supply chains more secure. And I believe we're winning the race to the future.
Details matter though. Execution matters. And I look forward to everyone here today giving me an update on your departments. And I'm incredibly optimistic about the future that we're building here in this country, but it requires solid work making these laws work. The devil is in the details.
Mitch Landrieu, who can't be here today because his dad, who I knew well, passed away. His dad was a hell of a guy. His dad, way back early in the sixties, took awas way ahead of everyone in terms of dealing with racial equity in the South, particularly in Louisiana and New Orleans. Andbut anyway, he passed away yesterday.
Mitch is doing a great job leading our team in implementing the infrastructure law. And earlier today Secretary Raimondo announced the plan we're putting in place to get the CHIPS Act off the ground, and that's just the beginning.
And separately, we're also hearingwe'll be hearing the latest from the Vice President and the Attorney General on everything our administration is doing to protect women and the right to choose in the wake of the Dobbs decision.
And finally, I want to welcome John Podesta. Where's John sitting?
Senior Adviser for Clean Energy Innovation and Implementation John D. Podesta. In the back. [Laughter]
The President. There you go, John. [Laughter] You're directly under Roosevelt's portrait, so you're okay. John is a good friend. He's on histhis is his first day on his new job. John, thanks for agreeing to come aboard. John has graciously accepted the task of helping to implement the historic clean energy investments in the Inflation Reduction Act.
And his experience in the highest levels of Government and the work being done by Gina McCarthy and Ali Zaidi are getting us to the point where it means we're going to hit the ground running. And that's the whole point here.
With this Cabinetexperienced, dedicated, and devoted to working familieswe're going to keep building a strong economy and good-paying jobs and products made in America and lead the world in innovation and success.
And I'm going to stop there and thank the press for being here. And be careful leaving.
Q. Mr. President, do you plan to meet Xi at the G-20?
Q. Do you have a message for Liz Truss?
Q. What are you going to tell her, Mr. President, about Northern Ireland, sir?
Prime Minister M. Elizabeth Truss of the United Kingdom 
Q. Are you going to meet the British Prime Minister?
The President. I'm going to be speaking with the new Prime Minister at 3:30. I'm looking forward to it.
Q. Are you going to be talking about Northern Ireland, sir?
The President. I'm going to talk to her about a lot of things. Thank you.
[Several reporters began speaking at once.]
Be careful. Don't get hurt.
President Xi Jinping of China/Group of Twenty (G-20) Nations Summit in Bali, Indonesia 
Q. Any plans to meet Xi at the G-20?
The President. If he's there, I'm sure I'll see him.

2022-09-05 00:00:00,"Remarks at a Labor Day Celebration in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania","
The President. It's good to be almost home. Well, I'll tell you what: You know, this is a pretty critical election, to state the obvious.
Before I start, I want to say a word about a few good friends that we lost: a guy named Jack Sheasome of you knewand Pat Gillespie. Both good friends, people I worked with my whole career. And they had an attitude that could be summed up in one word, in my view. A little bit like my dad would say, ""Everybodyeveryone, no matter what your background isis entitled to be treated with dignitywith dignity, with respect.""
And you know, I want to thank the elected officials here today. Bobby Casey has been a close friend of mine for a long time. His dad and I were friends as well. Matter of fact, we are ages split. Ihis dad was as much older than him, and Ime than I am withtoBobby. And we were raised in the same neighborhood in Green Ridge, about five city blocks away. Went to the same grade school, as I had moved because whencoal died in Scranton, there weren't any jobs. And my dad was in sales, not in mining. But we moved back down to Delaware, where he was from.
Moved to a little steel town called Claymont, Delaware. Claymont used to have more steel. It used to have almost 5,000 steelworkers. The whole community was builtit was a company town, literally. And steel died. It was dying inthere's not a single steel worker left.
And we know what happened was, about midway through myI got elected toI got very engaged inin my case, in the civil rights movement. And as a kid, I wasI worked a lot in the movement at work. And I got deeply involved in the Democratic Party, because the Democratic Party in Delaware was a southern Democratic Party then. We were amore of a southern State than a northeastern State.
And I got involved, and one thing led to another. And one day, a group came to me of the senior members of the party. They said they wanted me to run for the Senate. I said, ""I'm not old enough."" And I wasn't. I was only 29 years old. And a former chief justice whose family had more United States Senators than any family in American history looked at me and he said, ""You obviously didn't do very well in law school, Joe."" He said: ""You don't have to be 30 to be elected. You have to be 29. You can be 29. You just can't get sworn in until you're 30.""
And so one thing led to another, and I ended up deciding to run. But I was having great difficulty getting support. Even though people liked meor at least, the labor guys liked methey didn't think I could win until I got brought up to Pittsburgh by the local leader of the steelworkers in Delaware andinto Pittsburgh. And I came tohere and met with the then-president of the steelworkers. And he endorsed me about 9 weeks out, and I won by 3,100 votes.
So the fact is, you guys own me. You've been with me from the beginning.
And look, folksBobby, mayorRepresentative Boyle [Doyle],* Representative Lamb, Mayor Gaineyyour county executive is a hell of a guy. And John. If I have to be in a foxhole, I want John Fetterman in there with me. [Laughter] I'll tell you what, I want John in there with me. I mean that sincerely.
Look, there's a whole lot of folks here. I'mI don't want to keep you standing much longer, but let me just say a couple of things.
Number one, theyou know, I started my campaign because Tom jumped in and convinced mehe didn't convince me; he made the case I should run. Because that train ride, I was runningI was campaigning for Democrats. I was out of office, and I was campaigning for Democrats.
But you know what? This is not your father's Republican Party. This is a totally different party, man. These guys are different. I've worked with a lot of Republicansconservative Republicans I worked with. Got a lot done. And webut it was alwaysthere was always something decent about the work.
But then we moved to this place where, all of a sudden, the reason that made me runI decidedwas when you saw those people come out of the fields down in Virginia carrying torchesliterally coming out of the fields carrying torches, with swastikas, chanting the same anti-Semitic bile that was chanted inliterally the same anti-Semitic bile chanted in Germany in the thirties accompanied by the Ku Klux Klan.
And the guy that I beat in this electionlast electionand when they asked what did he thought, he said there were really fine people on both sides. I said: ""Something is really wrong. Something is changing."" And that's when I talked to Tom and others about helping me out. They decided to help me out.
Because look, folks, here's where I think we are, and I'm going to be brief: The fact is thatI think there are periods in history where we reach certain inflection points, where everything that's going to come after is going to change what's been before for the next generation.
And we're in one of those points. It happened six, eightevery generationevery six or eight generations. Things are changing. They're changing rapidly. You see everything from what's happening in Europe and India; from Russia, China. Things are changing. And the United States has to regain its footing and remember who we are.
And so one of the things that I concluded was that, you know, those inflection points are the places where you look back 2, 5, 10 years later and realize it's just not what it was before; it's either better or worse than it was before. Not the same. You're not going to go back to the same.
And I'm absolutely convincedand I mean this. No one has ever doubted I mean what I say. The problem is, I sometimes say all that I mean. And[laughter]. But all kidding aside, one of the things that was clear to me is that this new group, headed by the former Presidentformerthe former defeated Presidentwe found ourselves in a situation where we really are going to look forward or look backwards.
And it's clear which way he wants to look. It's clear which way the new MAGA Republicans are. They're extreme. And democracy is really at stake.
You can't be a democracy when you support violence when you don't like the outcome of an election. You can't call yourself a democracy when you don't, in fact, count the votes that people legitimately cast and count that as who you are. You can't be a democracy and call yourself one if you continue to do what they're doing.
And so, folks, look, we have a choice. When weTrump and the MAGA Republicans made their choice. We can choose to build a better America or we can continue down this sliding path of oblivion to where we don't want to go.
You know, under the American Rescue Planand I'm not going to go through all these things, but just to give you an exampleweyou know, we created morewe created nearly 10 million jobs in my first 16 months. Ten million new jobs in America.
That American Rescue Plan also created and saved millions of jobs. Why? Because here in the State of Pennsylvania and almost every State, they didn't have enough money to keep teachers on the payroll, to keep firefighters on the job, to keep police on the job, to keep peoplenurses and docson the job. And so what did we do? We, in fact, gave them the money to make sure they did it. And this Governoryour Governorspent it well, hiring thousands of firefighters and the like.
And what happened was, we found ourselvesbecause of the greed of some companies, we found that an awful lot of union members were about to lose their pensions. So we did something that hadn't been done in 50 years, significantly for labor: We passed the Butch Lewis Act. The Butch Lewis Act.
And they told methey told me I couldn't do it. They told methey really did. Remember, we didn'tand we didn't get any Republican votes for it. But we got it done. We got it done. Because it's just about basic decency and fairness. And look, every single Republican voted against thatevery single one.
The bipartisan infrastructure lawrebuilding roads and bridges and ports. As a matter of fact, I'm going to be back here not too long from now because we got $60 million to rebuild that bridge that collapsed the day I came here not long ago.
Folks, the money is going to go to expanding the nearbynearly 100-year-old failing lock and dam outside Pittsburgh. It's causing all this[inaudible]but it makes a big difference in terms of the economy. And so we're going to build a new terminal at the Pittsburgh airport.
We're doing this all over the countryall over the country. And it's creating good, decent jobs.
But the reason why I talk about unions is not just because it's where I come from. It's more than that. It's more than that. I said I spoke to the Business Roundtable, the CEOs of the largest companies in the United States, the national Chamber of Commerce. And I've been straightforward with them.
I said, ""Look, I'm a union guy, and I support them for one reason: because it's in your interest."" And they look at me like, ""What are you talking about?"" You are the best trained, the most skilled workers in the world. It makesno, I'm not just saying it. Most people don't realize, to join a lot of the trade unions, you have to have 4 or 5, 6 months6 years of training. It's like going to college. You get paid while you're there, but not very much. But it'syou're the best in the world.
And it makes a hell of a lot of sense for America to spend and companies to spend a little more money to have something that lasts a whole hell of a lot longer than it is to do something on the cheap.
Look, you've heard me say it before. Wall Street didn't build the middle class. Wall Street didn't build America. The middle class built America, and unions built the middle class. That's just a fact.
And by the way, the other thing that I found outI didn'tI had been in the Senate long time and Vice President. I didn't realize there was a law passed in early thirties under Rooseveltand the press is looking at me like, ""What's he going to say now?""; I'm going to tell themthat, in fact, said, ""Buy American."" That weany money a President spent that was appropriated, he could insist that the money could only be spent on American products.
Well, guess what? We're buying American. And I getand I get to spendof your money as President, I get to allocate over $600 billion$600 billionevery year. And they're American-made products made by American workers in America. And that's why we're moving.
Where is it written to say that we can't be a great manufacturing facilityhub in Americain the world again? We've made sure that we have now over 640,000 new manufacturing jobs. What'swhere does it say we can't do this?
So I start off with the proposition that it's about just basic decency. I'm not going to go on much longer, I promise. Here's what's happened. You know, we don't have a tax system that's fair at all. It's not even close. And that's why, for example, I've been pushing for tax fairness for a long, long time.
But guess what? They told me weI couldn't do that either. Well, there were 55 corporations in America in 2020 that made over $400 billion and didn't pay a single penny in income taxnot a single penny. Now they're paying a minimum of 15 percent in their income tax.
And guess what? To talk about the Inflation Reduction Act, andI've been fighting, when I was a Senator, for a long, long timefighting the pharma companies, fighting so that Medicare could set the price they pay for Medicare drugs and negotiate for those drugs.
Well, guess what? Anybody of youyou don't have to raise your hand, but any of you have a child who has type 2 diabetes who needs insulin every day, once a week?
Well, guess what? It costs those outfits 15 bucks to make and package it. That's all it takes. You know what they charge? They charge somewhere between 625 bucks a month and 1,000 bucks a month. It's wrong. It's simply wrong. They can make three and a half times the profit that theythat it costs them to do it.
Well, they said it couldn't be done. Well, guess what? We were able to change it, so allowingwhich we've been working for a long timeallowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices. We pay the highest drug prices of any nation in the world here in the United States of America. And guess what? There's no rationale for it.
So we finally passedMedicare is now negotiating. No seniorbecause of what we did in the Inflation Reduction Act, no senior, no matter how big their drug bill isif they're fighting cancer or any other serious problem, and they're spending thousands and thousands of dollars on treatmentguess what? They'll not have to pay more than $2,000 a month no matter what their bill is. No matter what their bill is. If they need insulin, they won't have to pay more than $35 a month.
I have been fightingI have been fighting Pharma for my entire career, my entire career. And we finally beat Pharma. We finally beat Pharma. Not a single Republican vote. Not a single vote.
Audience member. We respect you for it!
The President. Well, I tell you what. The fact is that there's a lot more we have to do. Like I said, we built 650,000 manufacturing jobs in America.
Today, unions in this country arehave now had the supportwhether they're union members are notof over 60 percent of American people. Never before has unionism been that popular. Labor unionsunions. Over 60 percent of the American people think it's important because they're figuring out: You are the bulwark against excess. You're the onesyou're the ones.
And by the way, you know, like all of you, like manyI shouldn't say ""all""like many of you, I wasn't raised poor. But I waswe weren't wealthy. We lived in a three-bedroom, split-level home in a little town calleda little area called Mayfield in Delaware, with four kids, a mom and a dad and a grandpop living with us. But we were all right. We were all right.
We could always tell when things were going rough. You could hear in the wall, three ofwe had two sets of bunks in one room. You could hear my dad when he was restless. I'd hear the headboard move. I remember asking my mom one day, ""What's the matter with Dad?"" She said, ""Honey, he justwe just lost our insurance.""
People shouldn't have to face that reality in America. That shouldn't be the case. Unions have made sure you didn't have to face that, but the rest of the country still is struggling.
And we finallywe're making significant changes in health care. We now are in a situation where we've been able to put another 2,400 bucks for a family of fourreduce the price of insurance forunder the Affordable Care Act. And by the way, these guys are still going after the Affordable Care Act. They want to get rid of it.
And the only reason anybody with a preexisting condition that isn't wealthy and can afford a very expensive policy has any coverage is because of the Affordable Care Act. The only reason. And they're still going after it.
And Social Security. From your first paycheck, you've been paying for Social Security. Well, guess what? The guy heading up the Republican campaign committee for the United States Senate, Senator Scott from the South, and the guy whose home State I just left in Wisconsinthese guys don't even think Social Security should be guaranteed. They want it on the ballot boxon the ballot every 5 years. Every 5 years, it has to be reauthorized.
You paid for it. And the guy in Wisconsin, he concluded that it should be every single yearevery single year, you should have to vote on whether or not you keep Social Security, whether you keep it or cut it or change it or alter it.
What's going on here, man? This is not the country that most of youthis is not the country most Republicansmost Republicanswho represented this State supported for the longest time.
And so, folks, look, the fact is that when you have Social Security that's under attack, when you have Medicare that's under attack, whenthe refusal to stick withfinding making sure that you're in a circumstance where you have some access to health care, this is, again, we can change things. And we're going to change them for the better.
You know, and here's the deal. You know, as I said, Wall Street didn't build this country. The middle class built it. And unions built the middle class.
Let me close on a serious note. When I announcedand I meant itI got roundly criticizedwith good reason; it's legitimate to criticize me on itI said I was running for three reasons. One, to restore the soul America. By that, I meant decency, honor, meaning what you say, literally treating people with some respect.
The second reason I said I was running is, I was so sick and tired of trickle-down economics. I wanted to build the economy from the bottom up and the middle out. Because when that happens, the wealthy do very, very well. They do very well. And everybody has got a shot. Everybody has got a shot.
And the third reason I said I was running: because I wanted to unite the country. And because you can't maintain a democracy without being able to reach a consensus.
I've spent a lot of time with foreign leadersfrom the leader of China, Russia, et cetera. The leader of China, Xi Jinping, just tells me straight upI've spent more time with him than any other head of state: over 76 hours.
And guess what he said? Democracies can't be sustained in the 21st century because they require consensus, and things are moving so rapidly, you can't get consensus, so that's why autocracies are going to succeed. Well, I reject that notion. I reject it. I think we can come out of what we got into stronger than we got into it when westronger than before we started.
And, folks, look, you know, all of us love the country. But you can't love the country and say how much you love it when you only accept one of two outcomes from election: either you won or you were cheated. It doesn't work that way.
You can't love the country when you refuseyou refuseto maintain just the basic democratic principles that were set out that we all learn from the time we're kids in school: that you accept the outcomes of elections. You can't say you love the country when, in fact, you either win or you have been cheated. And that's where we are now.
And I don'tthere's much more to say, but I've already said too much to you. But here's the deal. I am absolutely convincedI'm absolutely convinced, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart: There's not a thing we can't do in AmericaI mean itnot a single, solitary thing we can't do if we do it together. I mean it.
And it's about time we stand up and remember who in God's name we are. We're the United States of America. There's nothing beyond our capacity. So let's go out and demand, and it's the easiest proposition.
We'll win if people vote. So just remind everybody: Vote. Go out and vote. We vote, we win and reestablish this country and make it even better than it was before.
Thank you all for standing so long. God love you. I'm way beyondthank you.
What am I doing? I'm going out here?

2022-09-05 00:00:00,"Remarks at Laborfest in Milwaukee, Wisconsin","
The President. Hello, Milwaukee! My name is Joe Biden. I am Jill Biden's husband. And I want to start by saying: Any child under 12 years of age deserves a little extra ice cream or something for doing this. [Laughter] This has got to be the most boring thing in the world for you, honey. [Laughter] But we're going to work something out for you, I promise. Folks, if you have seat, don't hesitate to take them.
Audience member. We love you, Uncle Joe!
The President. Well, thank you, man.
Well, you know, I think this is getting to be a pretty gooda good year for a Labor Day. Eduardo, thank you for that introduction. It's great to be with Governor Evers, Representative Gwen Moore. Where's Gwen? There you go, Gwen. I love you, kid. You've been there every step of the way when I've needed help as President. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
And Mayor Johnson. Where is Mayorwhere is the mayor? There you go. You've got those two beautiful girls and a son. I tell you what, you've got to tell your girls you got to be patient with we dads. We're hard to raise. We're hard to raise. [Laughter]
And Iwhere is the county executive? Stand up, big guy? I think these guys spendI think these two guys spend all their time in the gymnasium. They look like they're in too good a shape.
And I want to thank Tammyshe couldn't be here todaywho's a champion of working people and always there.
You know, and the same goes to Lieutenant Governor Mandela Barnes, who couldn't be here, but he's going be your next United States Senator. Oh, he is.
And I want to thank Liz Shuler for her fearless leadership at the AFL-CIO. And thanks to Pam for your leadership of the AFL-CIO here in Milwaukee. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Where is she? Back there. Okay, there you are, Pam. I wasokay. I wonder where everyone is sitting.
And how about actually having a union guy as the Secretary of Labor? I'll tell you what, if you're going to be in a foxhole, you want Marty in there with you. Now, you may have trouble understanding when he starts talking about
[At this point, the President imitated a Boston accent.]
car barns instead of garages and talks[laughter]he talks kind of funny, but he knows what he's talking about. [Laughter] I promised to be the most pro-union President in American history, and Marty is keeping me to make that promise.
And by the way, the reason for that, I'lland I've had this conversation with the Business Roundtable and all the major chambers of commerceit's not just that I think that it's important that people get a shot. But look, the reason whythe reason why businesses should be hiring labor folks is simple: You haveyou're the single greatest technicians in the world. You're the best laborers in the world. You build the best product in theand no, no, I'm not just joking. I'm not just saying that. But people forgeta lot of the tradesthey forgetyou go to 4, 5 years of schoolyour apprenticeship. It's like going back to college. It's not like you, all of a sudden, just step in. You build a better product, it lasts longer, and it's cheaper for the business, and it's better for the country.
Lookfolks, Labor Day is a special day in the country forand here in Milwaukee. This is one of the biggest Labor Day events in America you all have here.
And it's a special day to me as well. Because the fact of the matter is, I wouldn't be here without unionsunions: electricians, ironworkers, letter carriers, teamsters, laborers, bricklayers, transit workers, plumbers and pipefitters, steelworkers. I wouldn't be here without cops, firefighters, teachers, nurses. I wouldn't be here without painters, pilots, autoworkers, custodians, carpenters, grocery store workers, steel metal workers, and so many others. That's not a joke. That's not a joke.
I got elected when I was 29 years old to the United States Senate in a State that had recently been ""right to work."" You know why? Because union labor endorsed me and fought for me. So bad news for you all is, I'm here because of you.
Look, the middle classthe middle classbuilt America. Everybody knows that. But unions built the middle class. That's a fact. That's a fact.
Look, folks, I believe we're at an inflection point in American historyI really mean thatthat comes around every five or six generations, an inflection whereone of those moments where everything is changing. Everything is changing.
And we're going to have to ask whether we want to be a country that moves forward or backwards; we're going to build a future or we're going to obsess about the past. I've said many times: We're the only country in the world that's come out of every crisis we ever faced stronger than we went in it. No other nation has done that.
And we do it because we've been a nation of unity, of hope, of optimismnot as a nation of division and violence and hatred that's being preached by some others.
I want to be very clear up front: Not every Republican is a MAGA Republican. Not every Republican embraces that extreme ideology. I know because I've been able to work with mainstream Republicans my whole career. But the extreme MAGA Republicans in Congress have chosen to go backwards: full of anger, violence, hate, and division.
But together, we can and we must choose a different path: forward. No, I really mean it. We have to. A future of unity, of hope, of optimism. We're going to choose to build a better Americaa better America.
There's no question it's been a hard few years, but we've come a long way. Today, COVID no longer controls our lives. More Americans are working than at any time in all of American history. Last year, more people applied to start small businesses than any year in history. But it didn't just happen. We never gave up. We never gave in. And we are delivering for working and middle class Americans nownow.
Nearly 10 million new jobsmore jobs than have ever been created at this point in any Presidency in history. Wages are up. Unemployment remains near a 50-year low. And the big reason for all this is the American Rescue Plan that I signed into law shortly after taking office, with the help of your Democratic Members of Congress. That's how we got it done. Not one, single Republican vote.
And the plan took America from economic crisis to economic recovery. And here in Wisconsin, your Governor and your mayor of Milwaukee used that money like it's supposed to be used: keeping city workers on the job in the face of rising costs, keeping streets safe by fixing streetlights, training 130 new firefighters, helping to hire close to 200 more police officers.
And not a single Republican voted for thatnot one, single one. Every single Republican in Congress in this State voted against that funding.
Audience members. Boo!
The President. So let me remind youno, I really mean it. Let me remind you what else was in that American Rescue Plan.
A thing called the Butch Lewis Act. Now, look, for too long, most Americans didn't know what that means. Those of you who have been driving trucks from factories to stores; bagging our groceries; building our buildings, bridges, roads, so much more. And with each paycheck you earned, the employees put money into that pension plan.
But some companies didn't set aside enough money to pay for those plans. And as a result, hundreds of pensions2 to 3 million workers and retireeswere going insolvent. Millions of retirees were at risk of losing their retirement security through no fault of your own.
So, with the American Rescue Plan, we passed the Butch Lewis Act to protect pensions all of you worked so damn hard for, pensions you sacrificed for. In retirement, it'd be a little like losing your Social Security and your Medicare.
It's one of the most significant achievements union workers and retireesfor union workers and retirees in over 50 years. And I'll say it again: Not a single Republican Congressman voted to protect your pensionsnot one.
Audience members. Boo!
The President. And by the way, I know a lot of them wanted to vote for it, but they're afraid of losing primaries in this new Republican Party.
We also passed a once-in-a-generation investment in our Nation's roads, highways, bridges, railroads, ports, water systems, high-speed internet. Folks, your Governor has already repaired over 5,000 miles [of roads],* 1,500 bridges here in Wisconsin alone. Just a start.
We will, when this is over, have the best infrastructurenot a jokein the entire world. The single best in the world. And that means jobs. No, that means jobs. That means we continue to lead the world. You can't do it without the best ports. You can't do it without the best airports. You can't do itI'm not going to go on, but the point is: You can't do it.
Right here in Milwaukee, it's estimated 40 percent of the homes still have lead service waterlead pipes for their water. Because of the infrastructure law, the city is receiving millions of dollars to replace lead pipes to make sure families have safe drinking water. Your child shouldn't have to worry about turning on the faucet or going to school, going to the water fountain and worrying about any kind of lead in the water.
Look, it's the biggest investment in America since President Eisenhower's Interstate Highway Act. And we made sure that the infrastructure law included significant labor protections. For example, the majority of the funds in the law are subject to Davis-Bacon. And it's not just because I wanted to help unions. It's simple: You're the best in the world. That's not hyperbole. No, you reallythat's not a joke. You really, genuinely are.
You don't just decide you want to be a pipefitter or an electrician. It takes you 4 to 5 years of hard work, the apprenticeships. It's like going to college. You're the best trained workers in the world, and you deserved to be treated that way.
And by the way, those of you who know me, no one ever doubts I mean what I say. The problem is, I sometimes say all that mean. [Laughter] I've made the same comments to the Business Roundtable, to the Chamber of Commerce. They understand it. They don't want to pay it; they understand it though. Because it's true.
I also signed the CHIP and Science Act, a groundbreaking law. We'll once again manufacture semiconductor chips that power everydayeverythingour smartphones, dishwashers, automobiles, national security stuffright here in America. Guess what? We invented it here. We invented it here in America.
And by the way, the reason why last time out, last year, inflation was so highyou know the biggest reason? Cost of automobiles. You know why they cost so much? They didn't have the computer chips to make the automobiles.
Folks, here in Wisconsin, Senator Baldwin made clear that you're ready to take advantage of this law with world-class universities and a workforce that knows how to manufacture a product here in Wisconsin. This law is going to create tens of thousands of jobs in America, bringing billions of dollars of investment here in America, well over $100 billion in investments in America, revitalizing American manufacturing.
Where is it writtenwhere is it writtenthat says America can't lead the world in manufacturing? Where does it say that? We've exported too damn much. In fact, next week, I'm going to Ohio for the groundbreaking of a multibillion-dollar semiconductor manufacturing plant. The company is Intel. It's one of the largest investments of its kind ever. They're putting $20 billion in as a start.
It's going to create thousands of jobsthousands7,000 construction jobs just building the facilities; 5,000 permanent jobs for blue-collar workers who will make $125,000 a year in those jobs.
And by the way, if you take a look, manufacturers all over the world are coming to the United Statesfrom Korea, from Japan, from all over the world.
Why? You know why the head of an outfit out of Korea told me they're coming here? Because we have the safest environment and the best workers in the world. That's a fact. We do. I'm not just saying this. This is real.
Look, folks, it means we're going to build the future in America with American workers in American factories using American-made products.
Look, it's something most people don't know, but you guys out there in this audience know: 15 percent of our military becomeveterans become union workers when they leave the military. Fifteen percent. How many veterans out there? Holler out. You've got it. In my State of the Union Address, I put forward what I call a unity agenda that included taking care of our veterans.
Look, we have a lot of responsibilities but only one sacred responsibilitynot a joke, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart and I've said it from the first day I entered politics: We have an obligation to equip those we send into harm's way and care for them and their families when they come homeboth their familiesespecially our veterans who've been exposed to toxic burn pits, like my son.
Those pits the size of football fields8, 9, 10 feet deep in Afghanistan and IraqI was in and out of those countries over 35 times in the middle of these wars as Vice Presidentthat incinerate wastes of wartires, poisons, chemicals, jet fuel, so much more.
A lot of people, like my son, had their hooch just probably 300, 500 yards from those pits. You could smell it. You could inhale it. Well, guess what? These poisonous fumes just camepeople came home with headaches, numbness, dizziness, cancer.
I just signedwe call it the PACT Actto take care of these veterans, who need medical assistance, and to provide for their families when they are gone. For God's sake, it's the least we can do. It's the least we
Audience member. We love you, Joe!
The President. Well, I love you too, kiddo. I tell you. Look, like I said, I believe we have a lot of obligationswe have a lot of obligations, but only one sacred obligation, and that's to take care of those vets we send overseas and when they come home.
Audience member. [Inaudible]
The President. No, I knowIbut I really mean it. And as I said, I just signed into law a historic Inflation Reduction Act. It wasn't easy to take big drug companies, but we did. I've been fighting them since I got in Congress 180 years ago. [Laughter]
You know, we pay more for our prescription drugs in the United States of America than any major country in the worldhere in the United States. Okay? There's no reason for it. For the last several decades, many of us have been trying to fix the problem. But for decades, Big Pharma tried to block giving lower drug prices for those on Medicare or anywhere else.
For decades, Big Pharma wonyear in, year outbecause they own chunks of the Congress, because they had help, like your senior Senator, Ron Johnson, who said
Audience members. Boo!
The President. No, I want to say what he said. He said he opposed lowering drug costs because it would result in ""punishing the pharmaceutical industry.""
Audience members. Boo!
The President. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. I mean, come on, man.
Not this year. We beat Pharma this year. We beat Pharma this year, and it mattered. We're going to change people's lives. We finally beat Pharma.
Now Medicare will have the power to negotiate lower prescription drug prices. We can guarantee no seniorno seniorwill have to pay more than $2,000 out of pocket for their drugs for the entire year, no matter whether their bill is $50,000. No more than $2,000. Period.
And if you're on Medicare and you have diabetes, your cost of insulin will be capped at $35. And by the way, there's a reason for that. You know how much it costs for them to make and package the insulin for diabetes? Ten bucks. Ten. Any of you have toyou need that insulin or your children need it. You know what it costs. It costs you somewhere between 650 and 1,000 bucks a month. It's outrageous.
Well, guess what? We also had, in this bill of minewe also had a provision that affected people who weren't on Medicare, but because of the leadership of your senior Senator and others, it got defeated. But I'm coming back and getting it.
Imaginethis about this. Imagine being a mom or a dadI mean this from the bottom of my heart. Imagine being a mom or a dad with a kid with type 2 diabetes, knowing you need that insulin and you don't have the insurance, you can't pay for it. I'm not joking. Think about it. Think about how it'd rip your heart out.
It's wrong. It's simply wrong. And we're going to end it. It costs 10 bucks, and you can make 35 if you want. That's it.
For decades, the biggest corporationsand by the way, I know corporations; I come from the corporate State of the world. [Laughter] More corporations are incorporated in Delaware than every other nationevery other State in the country combined. Okay? So I could write a doctorate on corporations. [Laughter] So it's not like I'm anticorporation generically. But I do think everybody should pay their fair share.
And by the wayand by the waylook, for decades, the biggest corporations and the wealthiest Americans have fought to block a fair Tax Code. Republicans passed a $2 trillion tax cut mainly benefiting the wealthiest corporations under the Trump Administration. Put us
Audience members. Boo!
The President. By the way, increased the debt by $2 trillion. Well, guess what? In 2000, 55 of those corporations earned a $40 billion in profit. They didn't pay a single, solitary penny in taxes.
Audience members. Boo!
The President. And the wealthiest Americansof those 700-plus billionaires in Americayou know what their average tax rate isthe Federal tax? Eight percent. They pay more taxes than any one of youlessfewer taxes than any of you pay.
Audience member. It's not right!
The President. It's not right. No, no, I mean, this isIit's just outrageous. Well, guess what? Guess what? I wasn't able to take careanyway. If you're a cop, a teacher, a firefighter, a steelworker, a miner, you pay double that Federal tax. It's just wrong.
But this year, the American people won. Now, big corporations have to pay at least a minimum tax of 15 percentat least. The days of billion-dollar companies paying zero, they are over in America. And they know they can afford it.
And while we're doing this, we're actually reducing the Federal deficit. You know how they talk about responsibletheythe last guy left me with a giant deficit. Well, guess what? In my first year, I reduced the deficit by $350 billion. And you know how muchyou know how much I'm reducing the deficit this year? One-trillion-five-hundred-thousand-reduction of the deficit.
And by the way, just by dealing with allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, it means Medicare doesn't have to pay out that many tax dollars to buy them. That alone is reducegoing to reduce, over time, $300 billion in the deficit.
You would think that if Republicans really cared about reducing inflation, they'd vote for the Inflation Reduction Act. But every single Republican in House and Senate voted against it. Every single Republican in the House and Senate.
Audience members. Boo!
The President. Now, I admit some of them voted against it. They thought it made sense, but they weren'tthey couldn't let Biden, quote, ""have a victory."" It's not my victory, it's the American people's victory.
In spite of the fact that while doing all this we lowered the deficit by a trillion-five this year here, here in America, every single Republican voted against lowering prescription drug prices, against lowering health care costs, against protecting your pensions, against lower energy costs, against creating good-paying jobs, against a fairer tax systemevery single one in the House and Senate. Every one.
And one thing more: When Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the National Labor Relations Actwhen it passed in the thirtieshe didn't say it was okay to be a union. He saidand in fact, it says we should ""encourage unions""""encourage."" Well, I'm encouraging unions. That's what I've been doing from day one.
It includes for public service sector workers in Wisconsin as well. Today, support for unions in this country is higher than it's been in nearly 60 years. Think about this. You guys know the numbers. Unions are morehave more support today in America in public opinion than any time in 60 years. The keyit's a key way to building the economy, to grow us from the bottom up and the middle out. I'm so sick and tired of trickle-down economics.
I come from a family where my dad worked hard. He worked like hell. We lived a decent, middle class life. We lived in a three-bedroom, split-level home in a development that wasthereas we werethe area was growing, with four kids and a grandpop. I sometimes wonderanyway, I wonder[laughter]it was great for us, but those walls were thin. [Laughter] But all kidding aside, we did fine. No complaints. We did fine.
But here's the point: The biggest contrast from what MAGA Republicansthe extreme right, the ""Trumpies""[laughter]they want to go tothese MAGA Republicans in Congress are coming for your Social Security as well.
Now, are youby the way, as I said, you might think I'm making thissome of this stuff up, it's so outrageous. But here's the deal, guys: The Republicansread the Republican campaign plan, the Senate campaign they put out this year. Go online and read it. Senator Rick Scott of Florida heads that campaign committee.
Audience members. Boo!
The President. It's all in black and white. I'm not making it up. You can go online and read it. They want to require Congress to vote on the future of Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid every 5 years to decide whether they continue.
Audience members. Boo!
The President. No, no, every 5 years, they get to vote to change, to cut, to reduce, or entirely eliminate Social Security and other things. How's that make us feel knowing you guys
Audience members. Boo!
The President. And then alongyou know, remember that song, ""Along Comes Jones""? And then along comes Ron Johnson of Wisconsin.
Audience members. Boo!
The President. He's arguing that 5 years is too long to wait to savage these programs people depend on. He wants to put Social Security and Medicare literally on that chopping block every single year, treated like any other appropriation.
Let me remind you: You paid for your Social Security and Medicare. It's taken out of your paycheck from the time you're 18 years old.
And the same guy who saidhe's the same guy who said if the Republicans get control of the Congress, they're coming after the Affordable Care Act again, denying health insurance to anyone with a preexisting condition. That's the only reason they havethey're able to get it.
Only reason they getif they have a preexisting condition, the only way they can insurance is because of the Affordable Care Act. That's not a joke. This guy never stops. [Laughter] But guess what? I ain't stopping either.
Folks, you and I, we offer a starkly different vision for this country, a vision of a fairer, more decent America. One where everybody has a fair share and where every American is treated withas my dad would saywith dignity. The economy that works for work, not wealth.
Now let me close with this: We're at a serious moment in our Nation's history, and it's not hyperbole
[There was a disruption in the audience.]
I mean it from the bottom of my heart. As I said last week, we remain in the battle for the soul of America.
By the way
Audience member. You're a liar!
The President. All right, God love you.
Audience members. Boo!
The President. Let him go. Let him go.
Audience members. Boo!
The President. No, no, no. Don'tlet himlet him go. Let himhe'slook, everybody is entitled to be an idiot. No, no. [Laughter] Everybody is entitled, okay?
Look, extreme MAGA Republicans don't just threaten our personal rights and our economic security, they embrace political violence. Lookno, look, the reasonI'm not talking all Republicans, I'm talking about these extreme MAGA Republicans.
Think about it. Think about it. The definition of democracy is, you accept the will of the people when the votes are honestly counted. These guys don't do it. Name me a democracy in the world where a leader argues to engage in violence. To this day, MAGA Republicans in Congress defend the mob that stormed the Capitol, and people died later.
Senator Johnson said it was a""by and large a peaceful protest.""
Audience members. Boo!
The President. Have you seen the videos of what happened on that day, listened to the stories of the members of both parties of Congress and the jeopardy they were put in? Cops attacked and assaulted. Speared with flag poles. Sprayed with mace. Stomped on, dragged, brutalized.
Police lost their lives as a result of that day. And the MAGA Republicans and your senior Senator said it was ""a peaceful protest.""
Audience members. Boo!
The President. Folks, you can't be proyou can't be pro-insurrectionistI'm being deadly earnest now. There's no democracy where you can be pro-insurrection and pro-democracy. So, when I say that democracy is at stake, I mean what I'm saying literally. You can't say you support law enforcement and call the people who attacked the police on January 6 ""patriots"". This was an attack on American democracy and all we stand for.
Imagine if you go home this afternoon, turn on the television, and saw several thousand people storming the British Parliament, knocking down the doors, threatening the lives, trying to overthrow the election of the new Prime Minister, and people dying. What would you think? No, I'm being deadly earnest now. Honest to God, what would you think? You'd think, ""This is not a democracy.""
Well, let me tell you something. Let me tell you something: This is why, in this moment, those of you in this countryDemocrats, Republicansand mainstream Republicans and Independentswe have to be stronger and more determined and more committed to saving American democracy than the MAGA Republicans and that guy walking out the door are [to]* destroying democracy, because democracy is at stake.
We got to remember who we are. We're the United States of America. There is nothingnothing we can't do if we do it together.
God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2022-09-02 00:00:00,Remarks on Manufacturing Promotion Efforts and an Exchange With Reporters,"
The President. Well, thank you all for your patience. Secretary Raimondo, thank you.
Bureau of Labor Statistics Report on the Employment Situation in August 
Before we begin, I'd like to speak very briefly about today's jobs report that was justbeen issued. We received more good news. In August, the economy created 315,000 new jobs. The great American jobs machine continues its comeback. America workers are back to work, earning more, manufacturing more, and building an economy from the bottom up and the middle out.
But with today's news, we have now created nearly 10 million new jobs since I took officenearly 10 million jobsthe fastest growth in all of American history. In August, we also saw that the share of Americans who are working in our economy went up. Economists call that ""labor force participation rate."" Working-age women are now, for the first time, back at work at rates not seen since before the pandemic.
Wages are up. Unemployment remains near a 50-year low. And yesterday we got thatwe got data that showed that manufacturing orders were up, but cost increases of supply chain items were beginning to ease. The week before that, we got data showing that price increases may be beginning to ease as well.
The bottom line is, jobs are up, wages are up, people are back to work. And we are seeing some signs that inflation may bemay be, I'm not overpromisingmay be beginning to ease.
Couple that with the fact that gas prices have now fallen 80 straight daysthe fastest decline in over a decadeand the price at the pump is now $1.20-a-gallon less than it was the beginning of summer. America has some really good news going into Labor Day weekend.
Manufacturing Promotion Efforts 
But we're also seeing something else critical to the backbone of the American economy: manufacturing. Manufacturing is roaring back. Since I took office, the economy has created 668,000 manufacturing jobs, the strongest manufacturing job recovery since the 1950s.
And just last week, we've seen major American companiesfrom First Solar to Corning to Micronannounce plans to invest tens of billions of dollarstens of billions, that's not a misstatementtens of billions of dollars, expanding manufacturing in America. We've seen major global companieslike Toyota and Hondaannounce that they are choosing America to invest and build.
None of this is happening by accident. These investments and this recovery are a direct result of my economic plan. Some people gave up on American manufacturing. Not me. Not the Secretary. Not the American people. ""Make it in America"" is no longer just a slogan; it's a reality in my administration.
I'm committed to building an economy from the bottom up and the middle out. You've heard me say that a thousand times. But that's what's happening. And that's what we're here to talk about today.
Now, a big part of the American Rescue Plan that I signed once Ia month after we got in officewe were facing a once-in-a-century pandemic, historic joblessness, businesses struggling to stay open, remote learning for our children.
But thanks to the American Rescue Plan, we have come a long way. We got vaccine shots in arms. We helped people who needed it the most. We kept teachers in classrooms, cops on the beat, firefighters on the job, because the local communities didn't have the money to pay for them.
And as a result, COVID no longer controls our lives. More Americans are working than ever. Businesses are growing. Schools are open. And today, we're celebrating a signature programthe American Rescueof the Americanwithin the American Rescue Plan that's going to help communities that need it most.
Look, it's called the Build Back Better Regional Challenge. It's centered around a vision that, as our economy recovers and modernizes, as science and technologies accelerate, and change the nature of how we manufacture, we want workers and small businesses leading this transitionmaking sure they're a part of it, not just being shunted asideinstead of fearing that the transition will be leave them behind. We're going to help them get retrained and many other things.
And thankthinklook, think of the 55-year-old small-businessman who has been making a single screwthis is literally truefor a combustible engine for cars for decades. He and his workers are worried. Why? Because we're moving to high-tech electric vehicles. We're going to help them and their businesses with training and new technology to help them make parts for electric vehicles and lead the transition to a clean energy economy so they're not left behind.
This is about investing in them, believing in them, helping them transition to a new world. They can do these jobs, just like they did the ones they had before. This is about jobs in their communities for themnot having to leave or not having to go on unemployment.
As new enterprises are created in the communities, they should havethey shouldn't have to leave. They should be the ones being able to fill in for those jobs. So we designed this program by thinking about people and places in a really important way. And I know I've got all of you up on the screen here in 21 different communities.
This American Rescue Plan program invests $1 billiona total of $3 [billion]*but $1 billion to create jobs and opportunity for people in the places where they live and where they've worked their entire careers so they don't have to leave. I know when folks hear such big numbers, they don't think it's for them. But this is for them. It is for them.
Over 500 coalitions applied for these grantsfrom community organizations to philanthropies, to labor unions, to colleges and universitiesall working together from every part of America. That kind of interest is a testament to the need and enthusiasm for this type of investment. Iit tookI take a look at this as a transition investment.
I'm so proud to announce 21 awardees, up on the screen here, who will each receive between $25 million and $65 million jobs to turn their plans into action. And as Secretary Raimondo just saidand I guess I wasn't supposed to start this off, was I? Come to think of it. All of a sudden, it dawned on me: I was supposed to let her speak first. [Laughter] But estimate these projects are going to result in 100,000 jobs created or saved, over $7 billion in additional private-sector investment in these 21 communities.
We want you to continue having good jobs in your communities so you don't have to leave, so your people in your communities are displacedaren't displaced. The winners are all here up on the screen, and they're going to empower communities in Pennsylvania, West VirginiaJoe, is that you? Is that Joe Manchin I see?
Senator Joseph A. Manchin III. I'm right here with you.
The President. Hey, Joe Joe. Good to see you, man. Thanks for what you're doing. A matter of a fact, you're one of the guys that started this idea with mewhat you neededwhat you're talking about neededhad happened in West Virginia.
But anyway
Sen. Manchin. And you kept your promise.
The President. They're going to empower communities in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Louisiana to lead our Nation's transition to clean energy. They're going to empower small manufacturers in Michigan, Kansas, North Carolina, El Paso, Texas, helping them modernize and become part of a supply chain for cutting-edge technologies, advanced manufacturing, biotechnology, aerospace.
They're going to empower agriculture workers in Fresno, California, women in St. Louis, Missouri, pursuing manufacturing careers through quality job training and apprenticeships that lead to good-paying jobs.
And they are going to support entrepreneurship and small business creation from Native American communities in Montana and to Tulsa, Greenwoodto Tulsa's Greenwood neighborhood, once known as the Black Wall Street, that I visited on the 100th Anniversary of the Tulsa Race Massacre.
Together, these projects are going to uplift underserved communities and include them as a key parts of America's economy for the 21st century. We're putting people who have been left behind in the past or couldn't becouldn't have been lifted out of anything before. They're going to be part of this recovery. They're going to be the ones who are going to leading the way here. They're going to be the ones getting retrained for these jobs.
Take the project in Georgia. I've recently signed a number of laws that is going to bring manufacturing jobs back to America and to make sure the future is made in Americathink of everything from electric vehicles to semiconductor chips. Georgia Tech, one of the great research universities, is a leader in understanding how artificial intelligence can be used to strengthen almost any industry.
But too many folks, especially small manufacturers in Black communities ruralor rural communities in Georgia, can't afford access to the knowledge and the research to be able to capture these jobs, to be trained for them.
They can't take advantage of all that technology that can make themfor them, all the difference between their businesses closing and thriving. So Georgia Tech partnered with HBCUs andlike Spelman College and Fort Valley State and local community colleges.
With this grant, they're going to take this technology on the road with mobile training studios. That's basically a high-tech van that's going to travel into underserved areas across Georgia to train a whole new generation of workers. Technology experts will provide workers who are interested in 4- to 6-week hands-on training that can make all the difference in their employment.
Think of a poultry farmer who might never have had a chance to learn how to artificialhow artificial technology can help manage inventory or improve the safety and quality while increasing their productivity.
Think of a family-owned paper manufacturer that could never have afforded trying out cutting-edge technologies, but now they're going to be able to. And they're going to be able to grow their businesses. And they can do it without ever leaving their home or their families. This is a game changer.
Take the projectionsthe project in Manchester, New Hampshire. And I'll tell you what: I heard so much from the delegation in New Hampshirefrom Maggie Hassananyway. I won't get into it. But theythis has been one of the things they've been pushing for a long timeboth Senators and the Congressman.
Their goal is nothing short of becoming a global epicenter for the next generation of advanced medicine. But to do it, they need world-class labs for clinical trials that will attract the most innovative biomedicine companies in theto locate and create jobs in New Hampshire.
I have to say that Senator Hassan and Shaheen and Congressman Pappas: I hear you. I hear you. I hear you. [Laughter] I know you've been talking about this a long time. We've finally gotten it. And they're going to need to bring struggling communities along in the process.
Because of this grant, Manchester is going to revitalize what was once one of the largest cotton textile plants in the world. Right now a 100,000-square-foot mill building is empty and idle, but not for long. Because of this grant, a coalition of city leaders and research and community organizations is going to transform that old mill into a modern marvel. It's going to house advanced science labs that are going to conduct groundbreaking clinical trials.
It's going to be the place where they can test biotechnologies and testand treatments that are going to save lives. And the Governorthe Republican Governor, working on itgoing to be there as well.
For workers, small businesses, entrepreneurs in the Manchester area, it means opportunity. It means jobs you can raise your family on in Manchesternot have to move. Because of this American Rescue Plan grant, they're going to be able to have access to cutting-edge technology and labs they never could have afforded before. This is going to allow them to compete with anyone anywhere in the world and make sure the supply-chain for these new medicines advancesmedical advances are built right here in America. It matters.
As you probably know, I could go on and on and speak about each of the communities here, but time won't permit. I applaud every community that received the grant and that applied. You're the reason why I'm so optimistic for the future of our country, I mean it.
You've heard me say it many times before. America is the only nation in the world that can be defined by a single word: possibilities. There's nothing but possibilities here. That's what this is about.
I want to thank you. And now I'm going to do what I should have done to begin with: Turn it over to the Secretary to begin this. But we've already gone by it.
So, Madam Secretary, the floor is yours.
Secretary of Commerce Gina M. Raimondo. Thank you, Mr. President. I think the fact that the President jumped in there right away is a testament to how excited he is about this project. He's fired up, and he's committed to it. And that's because he knowshe knowsthat we have to be investing in every community in America to help with the transition.
[At this point, Secretary Raimondo continued her remarks, concluding as follows.]
And I want to begin by calling on the Detroit Regional Partnership foundation. Congratulations, you all are receiving $52.2 million, which is incredible. We'd like to hear from you. And I'd like to call on Maureen. Just tell us a little bit about how are you going to invest the $52 million. What'swhat are the projects you're doing? And what does this mean for the small businesses in the supply chain in Detroit's auto manufacturing industry?
Detroit Regional Partnership President and Chief Executive Officer Maureen Donohue Krauss. Good morning. Thank you, Madam Secretary. And good morning, Mr. President.
The President. Good morning.
Ms. Krauss. We are thrilled to join you here today from Detroit, the global epicenter of mobility.
I want to introduce two of our partners who are with me today: Quentin Messer, Jr., who is the CEO of the Michigan Economic Development Corporation; Ned Staebler, who is the CEO of TechTown Detroit. In addition, we have a large group of over 140 partners who are joining us virtually and who worked together for this successful application.
[Ms. Krauss continued her remarks, concluding as follows.]
Thank you again. We welcome any questions. And we also want to invite you, Mr. President and Madam Secretary, in 2 weeks, to join us in Detroit at the North American International Auto Show, where we can show you in person how we are leading the way.
The President. I'll be there. [Laughter]
Ms. Krauss. Awesome.
The President. I'm a car guy. [Laughter]
Ms. Krauss. Yes.
The President. As you kind of noticed.
Ms. Krauss. Yes.
The President. Hey, look, I drive the Cabinet crazy and my staff crazy by asking them to give concrete examples that, if you walked up to somebody on the corner and said it, they could completely understand it.
One of the things that Ithis is pure Bidenbut I believe, and I've been saying for some time, that the next 10 to 15 years, more is going to change, in terms of technology and innovation, than has happened in the last 75 years. I mean that sincerely. Things are going to change so rapidly.
That's good if we're going to compete in the world, but also is scary as hell for somebody wholike, we were talking on the way over to this building about how there's hundreds of small companies supplying small parts to internal combustion engines. And you were giving me an example, Madam Secretary, of a bolt
Secretary Raimondo. A bolt.
The President. one company provides that is not going to be useful in an electric vehicle. And so what we're going to do is train that company and the ownership of that company what parts they can contribute to, to make that vehicle.
I'll give you a concrete example. Remember, when we were having the great difficultywe still have some difficulty in the supply chain of items coming from Asiaand the shipping, the vast majority of it comes through the ports in San Diego and Los Angeles and those ports. And the ports were asking for help all across the country for new technologies, new cranes, new movements, more robotics. I said: ""Okay, we'll do it on one conditionthat the people you have on the job now at the port are the people you train. You give them the opportunity to man the new machinery."" Not a joke.
And one of the things, I think, this iswas so important about what we're all talking aboutall of you are talking about isthink of all the people who've been breaking their neck and doing well, doing things that really matter, who are going to becomewhat they're doing is becomeis going to become obsolete because of how things are changing, whether it's a transition in the climate environment or whether it'smanufacturing or medicine, whatever it is.
And so, when you say you're going to providewe're going to provide in-depth assessment and assistance to 65 firms through a supply chain transformation center, that can sound pretty abstract to a lot of people. Give me an example of what you really meanwhat this will really mean for a company and its workers in this supply chain transformation center. What are you talking about?
Ms. Krauss. Absolutely, Mr. President, as you know, in our region, because you were very important here a few years ago in helping us make a transformation, we need to do it again. We have a terrific, talented workforce and supply chain. But we need to give them the skills that they need and the tools that they need.
[Ms. Krauss continued her remarks, concluding as follows.]
That also includes making sure that their employees have the skillsetsthe upskilling that they needso that they can be successful and, as you say, included and staying here in our region to do those jobs.
Secretary Raimondo. Mr. President, one of the things I love about what Maureen and her team is doing is that so often, we focus on the Big Three automakers, which is important, you know, for all the obvious reasons. But what they're doing is focused on the whole network of small suppliers, you know, the hundreds, if not thousands, of small, family-owned suppliers to the Big Three and making sure that, as Maureen said, they have the new materials, the new technology, the new training so that they can continue to service as we move towards EVs.
And so I give you a lot of credit for getting into the supply chain.
The President. The last thing I'll sayI could talk about this for a long time, but[laughter]going through two of the major American automobile plants for a long time, for an extended period of time, there was a lot of concern by the UAW about robotics and how that was going to displace workers when, in fact, being able to teach those folks how to use those robots, that increased productivity and doesn't displace them, is what's really happening.
And so it's all aboutyou can maintain the workforce, you can maintain theincrease the productivity, remain competitive internationally, and still get a lot done.
But at any rate, Imaybe with aas my grandfather used to say, ""With the grace of God, the good will of neighbors,"" I'll see you at the auto show.
Ms. Krauss. We welcome you. Absolutely.
The President. All right. Well
Secretary Raimondo. So the mention of robotics is a perfect segue. I'd love to turn it over to Stefani from the Southwestern Pennsylvania New Economy Coalition. You all will be receiving $62.7 million. I'd love to hear Stefani talk a little bit more about that.
To put this in perspective and to pick up on the point you just made, Mr. President, about robotics, Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh is, we all know, a world leader in robotics. And a lot of jobs have been created right around CMU. But if you're living in a coal community or a rural community outside of Pittsburgh, you might wonder: ""How do I fit in? How do I get a job, you know, with robotics and""
The President. You go to the county executive, that's what you do.
Secretary Raimondo. Exactly. [Laughter] That's why he's part of it.
So thatso that's what these guys are doing. So we'll turn it over to Stefani and the team, and maybe tell us a little bit about what you're doing.
Allegheny Conference on Community Development Chief Executive Officer Stefani Pashman. Sure. Thank you, Madam Secretary. And yes, Mr. President, I am joined today by several of your friendsthe county executive, Rich Fitzgerald; president of Carnegie Mellon University, Farnam Jahanian; and my colleague and the chief equity officer on the project, Majestic Lane.
And what I want to start off by saying is thank you for your vision. And thank you very much, Madam Secretary, to your incredible team and for you in making that a reality.
[Ms. Pashman continued her remarks, concluding as follows.]
And we're doing that in a way that is building programs for people. This is about people first: 14,000 workers, 750 companies that will fuel an entire new economy for us that we think won't just be about Southwestern PA and not just the United States, but globally to redefine how we do business and how we keep jobs at home in our communities, as you so well described.
Secretary Raimondo. Thank you. One of the things I love about this is, a lot of people when they hear ""robotics"" or they hear ""autonomous technologies,"" they hear, ""I'm about to lose my job."" And so what Stephanie and the team are doing is saying quite the opposite. This is going to create job opportunities for you, including in your rural community, not just in the neighborhood of CMU.
Ms. Pashman. Yes, I so appreciate that question, Madam Secretary, because as you can imagine, as the birthplace and the leader in robotics, this is a question we tackle and think about extensively. And I can start by telling you the data, which is we know that for every one job that may be displaced with robotics technology in a company, it's creating at least 1.5 and sometimes more.
[Ms. Pashman continued her remarks, concluding as follows.]
It's a more fulfilling job. It's a higher wage job. It keeps them in communities. And it actually allows them to have family-sustaining jobs where they were born and where they want to stay.
The President. Mr. President, at Carnegie MellonI had the honor of you showing me around Carnegie Mellonit's a great university for real; I'm not being solicitous. Are you working with smaller outfits, like the community colleges in the region? And talk to me about thethe sort of coordination between a great national university like yours and a community college in your community.
Carnegie Mellon University President Farnam Jahanian. First of all, Mr. President, thank you very much for your leadership. It's good to be with you. There are two aspects of it that I want to highlight. On one hand, what we're trying to do is to bring robotics and automation to small and medium-sized enterprises.
[Mr. Jahanian continued his remarks, concluding as follows.]
So the coordination with community colleges, with labor unions, especially in our poor, urban areas, and, as Madam Secretary alluded to, the 11 counties that surround us is part of our mission and what we're committed to. Thank you again for the opportunity.
The President. Well, let me ask you: How is this going to play out on the political scene? As a county executive, what are you going to be able to tell folks about what's happening with this $62 billionmillion dollars?
County Executive Rich Fitzgerald of Allegheny County, PA. Well, thank you, Mr. President. What we can tell people is, President Biden continues to invest in people and in jobs and in our future. First of all, congratulations on another great jobs report. I mean, Iwe shouldn't just go over that real quickly. Ten million jobs in your year-and-a-half tenure is really unbelievable. And a lot of them have been created right here in Southwestern Pennsylvania.
[County Executive Fitzgerald continued his remarks, concluding as follows.]
And by the way, we're looking forward to seeing you on Monday at Labor Day. [Laughter] You're always here with us, and we're looking forward to it. We're guaranteeing good weather, Mr. President. [Laughter]
The President. All right. [Laughter]
Secretary Raimondo. We'll take that.
The President. All right. Sir, do you have anything you'd like to add about what's going on in the community?
Allegheny Conference on Community Development Chief Equity Officer Majestic Lane. Well, sure. I think what's important about this is, you know, as you spoke to, Mr. President, often people think that robotics and AI are leaving people behind. But we're being really intentional, both demographically within our communitiespeople of color and womenand also in our rural communities about how do we connect people to inclusive career pathways, but also actually connecting them up to business development opportunities in the robotics and AI industry, which traditionally, they may not have had access to.
So what we're really doing is being intentional about figuring out how do we make these connections and really making this an economy for all.
So thank you, Mr. President.
Secretary Raimondo. One of the
The President. You know, one of the things, if I mayhaving been a significant consumer of health care and having family members who needed serious health care, one of the things that I think, in the health care side, most docs will tell you that when people get a diagnosis that is very dire, they need, really, a navigator. They need someone to help them know when to go to what appointment, what the appointments are for, how towhatjust explain what's going on.
Iit seems to me, we need some navigators here. And I'm wondering how you're doing that. I mean, you had someonelet's say, there's someonewe were doing this on a local Pittsburgh television station and someone listening is saying, ""Well, I'd like toI'd like to get trained. I'd like""I mean, how are you reaching out to the community? And do we have, essentially, whetherwhatever they want to call them""navigators"" to say: ""Look, here's the way you can get into this. This is what you do."" Or are people going into those small businesses that are going to be eventually displaced because of technologyit's going to be surpassedand say, ""This is what you""I mean, is thereis there thought about that?
Ms. Pashman. Absolutely, Mr. President. Thank you for that question. And that really is the spirit ofas I was talking about earlierour project and the way our partners are coming together. So we have five projects that are woven together, each with incredible organizations that know how to actually be on the ground.
Most of our money is actually going out to neighborhoods and communities, so they can actually use the organizations that know their people, that know where the businesses are, that know where those individuals are that have to get into the jobs, where those people are that are ready for entrepreneurial opportunities.
[Ms. Pashman continued her remarks, concluding as follows.]
So we're really relying on, as I said, 200 entities and partners who know how to navigate and know where businesses are and know where the people are to make sure we have a marriage and an alignment that can propel this opportunity,
The President. One of the things I've raisedand I've not raised with the Secretary, but I've raised you guys and everyone who is part of this grant effortI think it's usefulthink about it25 years ago, 30 years ago, almost every high school had shop classes, where you learned how to work with your hands, where you learnedyou could go and gettake carpentry or automobile. And you know, just to get a sense.
I really think we should be talkingand I don't have a program, sobut I think we should be talking abouta little bit about how we let high school students know how things are changing and what may be available down the road.
And I know we're supposed toI'mI know I'm taking this longer than I should. But a guy who has been talking about transition for a long time with me has been Joe Manchin. He'she lives, breathes, and eats West Virginia.
But, Joe, what'show is this going to helpif it isthe West Virginiato transition to a strengthenednot totally new, but a new economy?
Sen. Manchin. Yes, well, Mr. President, you and I have spoken many times about this when you first came into office, even when you was running at that time, about how West Virginians felt they were left behind. My wonderful State and all the great workers and the people in my State that worked hard and they're very proud, they've done the heavy lifting for years and years and years. And basically, they never complained. And as things started changing and transitioning, there was nothing left for them.
[Sen. Manchin continued his remarks, concluding as follows.]
So many people don't know how much is in there that's going to transition their lives and transfer them into an economy that's going to give them an awful lot of stability. So we're very proud.
The President. Well, Joe, thanks.
I'd love to talk to every one of you, but I'm getting the sign here. I'd better cut. They're going to[laughter].
Sen. Manchin. I was afraid you were going to get the hook. [Laughter]
The President. But look
Secretary Raimondo. I was going to say, we could do this all day, but
The President. The pointlet me conclude by saying this: This is not going to waste money, what we're talking about each of you doing; it's going to grow the economies. It's going to keep us in a position where we are the most advanced economy in the world and where we bring along the people who have made this country.
You know, I jokeand I don't want toI shouldn't get political, butlet me put it this way: The people who built the country are hard-working people who work with the sweat of their brow and their hands. And they'vethey're the ones that created the middle class. And I think this going to enable that same group of people, like most of us were raised by, to be able to have an opportunity to continue to do well and to take us through this next phase.
Because, you know, there's thatI alwaysJoe and my colleagues in the Senate used to always kid me for quoting Irish poets, but""All is changed. It's changed utterly: A terrible beauty has been born,"" as the Irish poet said. And we've got to take advantage of it, and I think we can. I really, genuinely think we can.
And I look forward to meeting all of you at some point along the way. And we're going to continue to keep this moving, because there's $3 billion total in this, and it's going to grow the economy. Everybody is better off.
When you grow the economy, everybody from the local drugstore to the local supermarket to the local churcheverything grows. And that's what this is about.
Anyway, thank you all.
Secretary Raimondo. Okay, thank you, Mr. President. I want to
Sen. Manchin. If I can say one thing to you, Mr. President?
The President. Yes.
Sen. Manchin. Thank you for not forgetting and not leaving anybody behind. I can't tell you how much this means to our hardworking people in West Virginia.
And they are truly appreciativethe families areto be able to stay where they love and theyand their heritage and their roots are. And so many of them had to leave. You've given them that opportunity. And you didn't forget, and you kept that promise. And I appreciate it.
The President. Well, Joe, remember I'm from hard-coal country: Scranton. [Laughter] All right?
Okay, anyway, thank you all so very, very much. And thank you, Madam Secretary.
Secretary Raimondo. Congratulations. Congratulations, everybody. And we're excited to work with you to make all of this a huge success.
And thank you, Mr. President.
The President. Thank you for your patience. Thanks. All right.
Former President Donald J. Trump/U.S. Democracy 
Q. Mr. President, Mr. President, do you considerMr. President, do you consider all Trump supporters to be a threat to the country?
Q. Mr. President
The President. Come on. Look, guys.
Q. Just, Mr.
The President. You keep trying to make that case. I don't consider any Trump supporter a threat to the country. I do think anyone who calls for the use of violence, fails to condemn violence when it's used, refuses to acknowledge when an election has been won, insists upon changing the way in which the rulesyou count votesthat is a threat to democracy. Democracy.
And everything we stand foreverything we stand forrests on the platform of democracy.
When people voted for Donald Trump and support him now, they weren't voting for attacking the Capitol. They weren't voting for overruling an election. They were voting for a philosophy he put forward.
So I am not talking about anything other than: It is inappropriateand it's not only happening here, but other parts of the worldwhere there's a failure to recognize and condemn violence whenever it's used for political purposes, failure to condemn theany attempt to manipulate electoral outcomes, a failure to acknowledge when elections were won or lost.
Thank you.

My fellow Americans, please, if you have a seat, take it.
I speak to you tonight from sacred ground in America: Independence Hall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This is where America made its Declaration of Independence to the world more than two centuries ago with an idea, unique among nations, that in America, we're all created equal. This is where the United States Constitution was written and debated. This is where we set in motion the most extraordinary experiment of self-government the world has ever known with three simple words: ""We the People."" We the people.
These two documents and the ideas they embodyequality and democracyare the rock upon which this Nation is built. They are how we became the greatest nation on Earth. They are why, for more than two centuries, America has been a beacon to the world.
But, as I stand here tonight, equality and democracy are under assault. We do ourselves no favor to pretend otherwise. So tonight I have come this place where it all began to speak as plainly as I can to the Nation about the threats we face, about the power we have in our own hands to meet these threats, and about the incredible future that lies in front of us if only we choose it.
We must never forget: We, the people, are the true heirs of the American experiment that began more than two centuries ago. We, the people, have burning inside each of us the flame of liberty that was lit here at Independence Hall, a flame that lit our way through abolition, the Civil War, suffrage, the Great Depression, world wars, civil rights.
That sacred flame still burns now in our time as we build an America that is more prosperous, free, and just. That is the work of my Presidency, a mission I believe in with my whole soul.
But first, we must be honest with each other and with ourselves. Too much of what's happening in our country today is not normal. Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our republic.
Now, I want to be very clear[applause]very clear up front: Not every Republican, not even the majority of Republicans, are MAGA Republicans. Not every Republican embraces their extreme ideology. I know because I've been able to work with these mainstream Republicans.
But there's no question that the Republican Party today is dominated, driven, and intimidated by Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans, and that is a threat to this country.
These are hard things. But I'm an American President, not a President of red America or blue America, but of all America. And I believe it's my dutymy dutyto level with you, to tell the truth no matter how difficult, no matter how painful.
And here, in my view, is what is true: MAGA Republicans do not respect the Constitution. They do not believe in the rule of law. They do not recognize the will of the people.
They refuse to accept the results of a free election. And they're working right now, as I speak, in State after State to give power to decide elections in America to partisans and cronies, empowering election deniers to undermine democracy itself.
MAGA forces are determined to take this country backwards, backwards to an America where there is no right to choose, no right to privacy, no right to contraception, no right to marry who you love.
They promote authoritarian leaders, and they fan the flames of political violence that are a threat to our personal rights, to the pursuit of justice, to the rule of law, to the very soul of this country.
They look at the mob that stormed the United States Capitol on January 6brutally attacking law enforcementnot as insurrectionists who placed a dagger to the throat of our democracy, but they look at them as patriots.
And they see their MAGA failure to stop a peaceful transfer of power after the 2020 election as preparation for the 2022 and 2024 elections. They tried everything last time to nullify the votes of 81 million people. This time, they're determined to succeed in thwarting the will of the people.
That's why respected conservatives, like Federal Circuit Court Judge Michael Luttig, has called Trump and the extreme MAGA Republicans, quote, a ""clear and present danger"" to our democracy.
But while the threat to American democracy is real, I want to say as clearly as we can: We are not powerless in the face of these threats. We are not bystanders in this ongoing attack on democracy.
There are far more Americansfar more Americansfrom every background and belief who reject the extreme MAGA ideology than those that accept it. And, folks, it is within our power, it's in our handsyours and mineto stop the assault on American democracy.
I believe America is at an inflection point, one of those moments that determine the shape of everything that's to come after. And now America must choose: to move forward or to move backwards? To build the future or obsess about the past? To be a nation of hope and unity and optimism, or a nation of fear, division, and of darkness?
MAGA Republicans have made their choice. They embrace anger. They thrive on chaos. They live not in the light of truth, but in the shadow of lies.
But togethertogetherwe can choose a different path. We can choose a better path: forward, to the future; a future of possibility; a future to build and dream and hope. And we're on that path, moving ahead.
I know this Nation. I know you, the American people. I know your courage. I know your hearts. And I know our history. This is a nation that honors our Constitution. We do not reject it. This is a nation that believes in the rule of law. We do not repudiate it. This is a nation that respects free and fair elections. We honor the will of the people. We do not deny it. And this is a nation that rejects violence as a political tool. We do not encourage violence.
We are still an America that believes in honesty and decency and respect for others, patriotism, liberty, justice for all, hope, possibilities. We are still, at our core, a democracy.
And yet history tells us that blind loyalty to a single leader and a willingness to engage in political violence is fatal to democracy.
For a long time, we've told ourselves that American democracy is guaranteed, but it's not. We have to defend it, protect it, stand up for it, each and every one of us.
That's why tonight I'm asking our Nation to come together, unite behind the single purpose of defending our democracy regardless of your ideology. We're all called, by duty and conscience, to confront extremists who will put their own pursuit of power above all else.
Democrats, Independents, mainstream Republicans: We must be stronger, more determined, and more committed to saving American democracy than MAGA Republicans are to destroying American democracy.
We, the people, will not let anyone or anything tear us apart. Today, there are dangers around us we cannot allow to prevail. We hearyou've heard itmore and more talk about violence as an acceptable political tool in this country. It's not. It can never be an acceptable tool.
So I want to say this plain and simple: There is no place for political violence in America. Period. None. Ever.
We saw law enforcement brutally attacked on January the 6th. We've seen election officials, poll workersmany of them volunteers of both partiessubjected to intimidation and death threats. Andcan you believe it?FBI agents just doing their job as directed, facing threats to their own lives from their own fellow citizens.
On top of that, there are public figurestoday, yesterday, and the day beforepredicting and all but calling for mass violence and rioting in the streets. This is inflammatory. It's dangerous. It's against the rule of law. And we, the people, must say: This is not who we are.
Ladies and gentlemen, we can't be pro-insurrectionist and pro-American. They're incompatible. We can't allow violence to be normalized in this country. It's wrong. We each have to reject political violence with all the moral clarity and conviction this Nation can muster. Now. We can't let the integrity of our elections be undermined, for that is a path to chaos.
Look, I know politics can be fierce and mean and nasty in America. I get it. I believe in the give-and-take of politics, in disagreement and debate and dissent.
We're a big, complicated country. But democracy endures only if we, the people, respect the guardrails of the republic; only if we, the people, accept the results of free and fair elections; only if we, the people, see politics not as total war, but mediation of our differences.
Democracy cannot survive when one side believes there are only two outcomes to an election: either they win or they were cheated. And that's where MAGA Republicans are today. They don't understand what every patriotic American knows: You can't love your country only when you win. It's fundamental.
American democracy only works only if we choose to respect the rule of law and the institutions that were set up in this chamber behind me, only if we respect our legitimate political differences.
I will not stand by and watchI will notthe will of the American people be overturned by wild conspiracy theories and baseless, evidence-free claims of fraud. I will not stand by and watch elections in this country stolen by people who simply refuse to accept that they lost. I will not stand by and watch the most fundamental freedom in this countrythe freedom to vote and have your vote countedandbe taken from you and the American people.
Look, as your President, I will defend our democracy with every fiber of my being, and I'm asking every American to join me.
[At this point, there was a disruption in the audience.]
Throughout our history, America has often made the greatest progress coming out of some of our darkest moments, like you're hearing from that bullhorn. I believe we can and we must do that again, and we are.
MAGA Republicans look at America and see carnage and darkness and despair. They spread fear and lies, lies told for profit and power. But I see a very different America, an America with an unlimited future, an America that is about to take off. I hope you see it as well. Just look around.
I believed we could lift America from the depths of COVID, so we passed the largest economic recovery package since Franklin Delano Roosevelt. And today, America's economy is faster, stronger than any other advanced nation in the world. We have more to go.
I believed we could build a better America, so we passed the biggest infrastructure investment since President Dwight D. Eisenhower. And we've now embarked on a decade of rebuilding the Nation's roads, bridges, highways, ports, water systems, high-speed internet, railroads.
I believed we could make America safer, so we passed the most significant gun safety law since President Clinton.
I believed we could go from being the highest cost of prescriptions in the world to making prescription drugs and health care more affordable, so we passed the most significant health care reforms since President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act.
And I believed we could create a clean energy future and save the planet, so we passed the most important climate initiative ever, ever, ever.
The cynics and the critics tell us nothing can get done, but they're wrong. There is not a single thing America cannot do, not a single thing beyond our capacity if we do it together. It's never easy. But we're proving that in America, no matter how long the road, progress does come.
Look, I know the last yearfew years have been tough. But today, COVID no longer controls our lives. More Americans are working than ever. Businesses are growing. Our schools are open. Millions of Americans have been lifted out of poverty. Millions of veterans once exposed to toxic burn pits will now get what they deserve for their families and the compensation.
American manufacturing has come alive across the Heartland, and the future will be made in America, no matter what the White supremacists and the extremists say.
I made a bet on you, the American people, and that bet is paying off. Proving that from darknessthe darkness of Charlottesville, of COVID, of gun violence, of insurrectionwe can see the light. Light is now visible. Light that will guide us forward not only in words, but in actions: actions for you, for your children, for your grandchildren, for America.
Even in this moment, with all the challenges we face, I give you my word as a Biden: I've never been more optimistic about America's future. Not because of me, but because of who you are. We're going to end cancer as we know it. Mark my words. We're going to create millions of new jobs in a clean energy economy. We're going to think big. We're going to make the 21st century another American century, because the world needs us to.
That's where we need to focus our energy, not in the past, not on divisive culture wars, not on the politics of grievance, but on a future we can build together.
The MAGA Republicans believe that for them to succeed, everyone else has to fail. They believe Americanot like I believe about America. I believe America is big enough for all of us to succeed, and that is the Nation we're building: a nation where no one is left behind.
I ran for President because I believed we were in a battle for the soul of this Nation. I still believe that to be true. I believe the soul is the breath, the life, and the essence of who we are. The soul is what makes us ""us.""
The soul of America is defined by the sacred proposition that all are created equal in the image of God; that all are entitled to be treated with decency, dignity, and respect; that all deserve justice and a shot at lives of prosperity and consequence; and that democracydemocracymust be defended, for democracy makes all these things possible. Folks, and it's up to us.
Democracy begins and will be preserved in we, the people's, habits of heart, in our character: optimism that is tested yet endures, courage that digs deep when we need it, empathy that fuels democracy, the willingness to see each other not as enemies, but as fellow Americans.
Look, our democracy is imperfect. It always has been.
Notwithstanding those folks you hear on the other side there. They're entitled to be outrageous. This is a democracy. But history and common sense[applause]good manners is nothing they've ever suffered from.
But history and common sense tell us that opportunity, liberty, and justice for all are most likely to come to pass in a democracy. We have never fully realized the aspirations of our founding, but every generation has opened those doors a little bit wider to include more people who have been excluded before.
My fellow Americans, America is an idea, the most powerful idea in the history of the world. And it beats in the hearts of the people of this country. It beats in all our hearts. It unites America. It is the American creed.
The idea that America guarantees that everyone be treated with dignity. It gives hate no safe harbor. It installs in everyone the belief that no matter where you start in life, there's nothing you can't achieve.
That's who we are. That's what we stand for. That's what we believe. And that's precisely what we are doing: opening doors, creating new possibilities, focusing on the future. And we're only just beginning.
Our task is to make our Nation free and fair, just and strong, noble and whole. And this work is the work of democracy, the work of this generation. It is the work of our time, for all time.
We can't afford to haveleave anyone on the sidelines. We need everyone to do their part. So speak up. Speak out. Get engaged. Vote, vote, vote.
And if we all do our dutyif we do our duty in 2022 and beyondthen ages still to come will say weall of us herewe kept the faith. We preserved democracy. We heeded ourwe heeded not our worst instincts, but our better angels. And we proved that, for all its imperfections, America is still the beacon to the world, an ideal to be realized, a promise to be kept.
There's nothing more important, nothing more sacred, nothing more American. That's our soul. That's who we truly are. And that's who mustwe must always be.
I have no doubtnonethat this is who we will be and that we'll come together as a nation; that we'll secure our democracy; that for the next 200 years, we'll have what we had the past 200 years: the greatest nation on the face of the Earth.
We just need to remember who we are. We are the United States of America. The United States of America.
And may God protect our Nation, and may God protect all those who stand watch over our democracy. God bless you all. Democracy. Thank you.

The President. Mr. Mayor, thank you. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Before you walk down, I want the Caseys to come up with me, because where I come from, Scranton's Casey's Country. We got raised in the same neighborhood, in Green Ridge, not far from two of the best little candy shops in thein thisin the whole country. And I just wanted to letIthey can't deny me, that's why I wanted them up here. [Laughter] I want them to know.
And by the way, this guy ishas more integrity in his little finger than most people have in their whole body. That's why I love working with him.
Senator Robert P. Casey, Jr. Welcome home.
The President. And, like me, he married way up. [Laughter] Way up. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.
[At this point, the President briefly addressed audience members standing behind the podium as follows.]
As my mother, Jean Finnegan Biden, from Green Ridge would say, please excuse my back when I'm speaking. I apologize.
And by the way, you know, one of the best things of all of being President of the United States is the Marine Band. They're the best in the world. Stand up, guys. They are the very, very, very, very best. They can not only play; they know how to fight, too. [Laughter] God love you. Thank you for being here. Thank you for being here.
Audience member. President Biden, I love you!
The President. Well, thank you very much. Thank you. How are you, baby? How old are you? How old are you?
Audience member. Nine!
The President. You're almost double figures. [Laughter]
Well, look, folks. It's great to be here in Wilkes-Barre. I mean that sincerely.
Audience member. Hi, Mr. President!
Audience member. Welcome home!
Audience member. We love you!
The President. Well, thank you. Well, thank you so much. Mayor Brown, thank you for that introduction and the passport to this great city. And, Mayor Cognetti, it's almostwe're almost nearwe're almost in heaven. We're almost in Scranton. [Laughter] Almost. Being raised in Scranton, they used to say, ""You're going down the line?""
Any rate, you know, and what a leadership lineup you have here in Pennsylvania. I want to thank your outstanding Governor, Tom Wolf. Tom and I have been friends a long time. He's truly one of the best Governors in the United States of America. Not a joke. Not a joke. And a standup guy. A standup guy. And Josh Shapiro is a champion for the rule of law as your attorney general, and he's going to make one hell of a Governor. I really mean it.
And by the way, he couldn't be here todaywe spokeLieutenant Governor John Fetterman. He'swhen I say he's a powerful voiceI used to be, in the old days, a pretty good athlete. And if someone was really big and tough, you'd say, ""I wouldn't screw with him if I had a sledge hammer."" [Laughter] Well, I tell you what, Fetterman's a hell of a guy, a powerful voice for working people. And he's going to make a great United States Senator. He's going to make a great United States Senator.
And as I said, Bobby Caseyhe's one of my closest friends, one of our great United States Senators. And your Congressman, Matt Cartwright, is the real reason I'm here. I'm in Cartwright Country. He knows how to deliver for this district, which is so close to my heart.
Look, I especially want to thank all the members of law enforcement who are here, many of whom are behind me, for always being there for us. And we should always be there for them.
And by the way, also a group that you need badlyyou don't really appreciate until you need themis the firefighters. The firefighters have been with me my whole career. And let me tell you something, there's an old expression: God made man, then he made a few firefightersbecause you got to be crazy to be a firefighter. [Laughter]
And by the way, please sit down. I'm sorry. Please sit down. I keep forgetting. [Laughter] I
Audience member. [Inaudible]
The President. Thank you. But look, when I ran for President, I said I looked at the world the way I looked at it growing up in Scranton, and that wasn't hyperbole. I meant that. The familieswhat families wanted wasin Scranton, when I was growing upand my mom and dad and my grandpopwas as basic, basic, basic as it is today: a decent job, the opportunity to be treated with dignity. Everyonemy dad would say, ""Everybodyeverybodyis entitled to be treated with dignity, just simple dignity.""
The fact is that wantthey want to be able to go to good schools in safe neighborhoods, a decent place to live, and just a fair shot, just a fair shot for their kids. You know, a peace of mind knowing your kids can go to school or to the playground or the movies or the high school game and come home safely and not have to think about it.
But for too long, too many families haven't had that peace of mind. They watch the news and they see kids being gunned down in schools and on the streets. Almost every single night you turn the news on, that's what you see. They see their neighbors lose their loved ones to drugs like fentanyl, which is a flat killer. They see hate and anger and violence just walking the streets of America, and they just want to feel safe again. They want to feel a sense of security. And that's what my crime plan is all about.
You know, I call it the Safer Americas Plan, and both your Members of Congress voted for it. It's based on a simple notion: When it comes to public safety in this Nation, the answer is not ""defund the police,"" it's ""fund the police."" Fund the police. And give themwe expect them to do everything. We expect them to beto protect us, to be psychologists, and to be sociologists. I mean, we expect you to do everything. I'm not joking. Everything.
You realize more police officers are killed dealing with domestic violence than anything else? Do you realize that? The point is: We ask so much of youso much of you.
I've not met a cop who likes a bad cop. There's bad in everything. There's lousy Senators. There's lousy Presidents. There's lousy doctors. There's lousy lawyers. No, I'm serious. But I don't know any police officer that feels good about the fact that there may be a lousy cop. And I'm tired of not giving the kind of help they need.
Folks, look, we're in a situation in this country where we have to give them additional resources they need to get their job done. Matt gets itMatt Cartwright. And I'm not justthis is not hyperbole. Matt's the chair of the powerful subcommittee that controls the funding for public safety. He knows what it means, investing in effective and accountable community policing that builds public trust and strengthens public safety.
I'm old enough to remember when cops used to walk the beat in Wilmington and in Scranton, because they knew everybody. They knew the kidthey knew if something was trouble, they knew whose house to go and knock on the door and say, ""Mom, your son just did""I'm beingI'm not being facetious. They knew the neighborhoods.
As part of the American Rescue Plan I signed into law last year, which they voted for, we set aside 350 billionwith a ""B""billion dollars for State and local governments all across America, and urged them to use it, like your Governor did, to make communities safer.
Here in Pennsylvania, Governor Wolf is using $250 million of that money to reduce crime and violence across this State. And Mayor Brown just described how it's helping to fund community policing here in Wilkes-Barre.
But guess what? Every single Republican Member of Congressevery single one in this State, every single onevoted against the support for law enforcement. They talk about how much they love it; they voted against the funding. Flat out. Flat out. Every Republican in the House, every Republican in the Senate, every single one.
I know we expect so much from our law enforcement officers, so we need to support them. That's why my crime plan to help communities recruit, hire, and train nationwide more than 100,000 additional officersaccountable officersfor community policing.
And I mean it. Folks, when it comes to fighting crime, we know what works: officers on the street who know the neighborhoodnot a jokewho know the neighborhood; who know the families they're protecting; who get the training they need to be able to do their jobs well; who work to earn the community's trust.
And as we hire more police officers, there should be more training, more help, and more accountability. Without public trust, law enforcement can't do its job serving and protecting all the communities.
If I can just interject for a momentmy deceased son Beau, he was the attorney general of the State of Delaware. And what he used to do is go down, in the east side, thecalled the ""Bucket""highest crime rate in the country. It's a place where I used toI was the only White guy that worked as a lifeguard down in that area, on the east side.
And you know where theyou could always tell where the best basketball in the State is or the best basketball in the city is: It's where everybody shows up.
And he'd go down and hang out and sit on a bench with my grandson, who's now 17 years old. And the police used to be in the car, the local city police. And he'd walk up and bang on the window and say: ""Get out of the car, damn it, and meet these people. Let them see you. Let them know you. Let them know who you are.""
Well, the truth wasremember what happened to community policing? We went from having enough cops on the street, to cities doing well, and then deciding they don't need more police officers, so they reduced the police forces. So you didn't have two cops in every vehicle; you had one cop in every vehicle. And I don't blame one cop for not getting out in somecertain neighborhoodsnot getting out of the car.
And what happens isit used to beI can remember that when my son was the attorney general, he'd go around in the tougher neighborhoods and he would ensure that every single cop gave his cell phone number to the local liquor store owner, the local church, the local grocery store, the local hamburger joint so if there was a problem, they'd pick up the phone and call. Because what do people not want to do in tough neighborhoods? They don't want to be the one identified as turning so-and-so in.
I remember going on the east side in Wilmington, in one of those old Victorian two-, three-story apartment buildings, and going up to see a woman whose nameshe's passed away, but I won't mention her name nowand standing in that rotunda thatthat part that stuck out around the building.
And she said: ""Joey, I knowI know what's going on. They all plan it downstairs. I can hear them, but I'm afraid to tell anybodyafraid to tell anybody."" The gangs.
And so I got herso thatI got a phone number for the local cops. She'd call. They promised not to identify her, because they knew there'd be retribution. And the crime rate began to drop. For real. Not a joke.
You've got to know people. You've got to know and you've got to be able to trust the police. And the police had to be able to trust the community. But we slipped away from that. And we have a hell of a lot fewer cops today than we did when I wrote that initial crime bill. But now we've got to get back to it.
And by the way, I'm not making the case there aren't bad cops. There are some really lousy cops. There are some really lousy doctors. There are some really lousy lawyers. I mean it.
But here's the point: As we've seen too often, public trust is frayed and is broken, and it undermines public safety when it gets frayed. It literally undermines safety. Families across the country have to ask why, in this Nation, for example, so many Black Americans wake up knowing they could lose their lives just by living their lives.
If you come from neighborhoods like I come from down in Delaware, if you have a 16- or 17-year-old son and he gets a driver's license, you sit down and say: ""Look, if you get stopped, put your hands on the wheel. Don't do anything."" JustI mean, I'm being serious. I'm being serious.
But here's the point: Simply jogging, sleeping in their homesyou know, whether they made headlines or not, they have a lot of lost souls. Increased trust makes policing more effective and it strengthens public safety.
And the communities, by the way, that want the police more than any other community are the tough, poor communities. Black, White, immigrantsthey need the help; they want the help. It's not that they don't want it. They want the help.
Without that, victims don't call for help, witnesses don't step forward, crimes go unsolved, justice isn't served.
I took executive action, which I'm allowed to do as PresidentI always admired Governors who can take executive action[laughter]but all kidding aside, to make some of these reforms for Federal officers. I couldn't do it for State officers.
One, no Federal officer is allowed to use a chokehold. No Federal officer can restrictthere's restricted no-knock warrants. We created a national database for officers who have misbehaved and been held accountable so they can't hide. My plan will help make sure that State and local governments adopt these same reforms.
And my plan does something else really important: It addresses the opioid epidemic. You notice how many people are dying of opioid overdoses now? And by the way, laced with fentanyl. The attorney general, Shapiro, can tell you more about that than you'd ever want to know, for a fact. For real. And it's beenhe's been such a strong leader on this.
But we're going to impose tougher penalties for deadly fentanyl trafficking that's poisoning communities across this country.
This is a key part of the unity agenda I'm announcing in my Statethat I announced in my State of the Union Address. We can do this. We have to do this. We'll make America safer.
My plan also takes commonsense action to reduce gun violence and violence overall. It builds on the progress we made this summer when I signed into law the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the most significant gun safety law we passed in 30 years. It took 30 years.
And we beat the NRA. We took them on, and we beat the NRA straight up. You have no idea how intimidating they are to elected officials. The NRA was against it, which means the vast majoritythe vast majorityof Republicans in Congress couldn't even stand up and vote for it because they're afraid of the NRA. It's not unusual. Every Democrat, Republican, Senatorsthey get afraid of certain interest groups. They voted against it.
Law enforcement supported it. Faith leaders and teachers supported it. Victims of gun violence and their families supported it. Young people in this country, like the students of the greatthis great university, support it.
And the NRA and the vast majority of Congressional Republicans voted against itsaving lives and keeping America safe. But guess what? We took on the NRA, and we're going to take them on again. And we won. And we will win again.
But we're not stopping here. I'm determined to ban assault weapons in this country. Determined. I did it once before, and I'll do it again.
For many of you home, I want to be clear: It's not about taking away anybody's guns. In fact, we should be treating responsible gun owners as examples how every gun owner should behave.
I have two shotguns at home. Iit's a long story, but I'm not opposed to guns. But I support the Second Amendment. And I support the Second Amendment. But the Second Amendment, as one of the most conservative Justices in history, Justice Scalia, once wrote, ""Like""quote, ""Like most rights, the rights granted by the Second Amendment are not unlimited."" They're not unlimited.
Right now you can't go on and buy an automatic weapon. You can't go out and buy a cannon.
And for those brave, right-wing Americans who say it's all about keeping America as independent and safe: If you want to fight against the country, you need an F-15. You need asomething a little more than a gun. [Laughter] No, I'm not joking. Think about this. Think about the rationale we usethat's used to provide this. And who are they shooting at? They're shooting at these guys behind me.
Folks, look, I went to every major school shooting in aroundin the country since I was the chairman of the Judiciary Committee all the way throughas Vice President and President. Over 48,000 people died from gunshot wounds in 2021 in the United States of America, over 26,000 by suicide.
When guns are the number-one killerlisten to thisthe guns are the number-one killer of children in Americaof children. They're number one. More childrendie from guns than active-duty police and Active-Duty military personnel combined.
Hear that again: More children in America die from guns than active-duty police and Active Duty military in the United States combined.
We have to act. We have to act for those families in Buffalo, Uvalde, Newtown, El Paso, Parkland, Charleston, Las Vegas, Orlando. I've been to every one of those sites, sit down with those parents. I spent 4 hours last time. I met with every single one of the parents and families who have lost someone, seen the looks in their faces.
Think about it. Think about the devastation that's occurred. We have to act for all those kids gunned down on our streets every single day that never make the news. There's a mass shooting every single day in this country in the streets of Americaevery single day.
You have to askyou have to act so our kids can learn to read in school, instead of learning to duck and cover. Literally, schools all across America, kids are showing up with psychological damage done to our kids, not just COVID. With COVID, what its impactand how it's impacting us. And on top of that, a child going to schoolchildren see this on television.
You know, we're living in a country awash with weapons of war, weapons that weren't designed to huntwere designed to take on an enemy. Therethat's what they're designed to do. For God's sake, what's the rationale for these weapons outside of a war zone? They inflict severe damage.
When I was recently in UvaldeI almost hesitate to say this, with some of the kids in hereyou know what some of the parents had to do? Supply DNA. Supply DNA. These AR-15s just rips the body apart. Could not identifycould not identifythe body. And a 20-year-old kid can walk in and buy one? DNA to say, ""That's my baby."" What the hell is the matter with us?
Audience members. Say it again.
The President. No, I'm not joking. Think about it. What are we doing? And by the way, how manymy dad used to love to hunt in the Poconos when we lived in Scranton. How many deer or bear are wearing Kevlar vests, huh? [Laughter] Not a joke. Do you realize the bullet out of an AR-15 travels five times as rapidly as a bullet shot out of any other gun, five timesis lighterand can pierce Kevlar? Imagine being a parentnot just losing a child, but not being able to physically identify the child, or the adult, because they've literally been blown apart.
We equip our servicemembers with the most lethal weapons on Earth to protect all of us, protect Americans. But we require them to receive significant training, extensive background checks, mental health assessments. They have to learn how to lock up and store their weapons responsibly or they get kicked out. But we let any strangeran 18-year-oldwalk ina 20-year-oldand buy an AR-15.
That's why, back in 1994, I took on the NRA and passed the assault weapons ban. For 10 years, mass shootings were down10 years in a row since I passed that legislation in 1994 as a chairas a Senator. But in 2004, Republicans let that ban expire. And what happened? Mass shootings in America tripled. Tripled.
It's time to ban these. It's time to ban these weapons. We did it before, and we can do it again. Folks, it's time to hold every elected official's feet to the fire and ask them: ""Are you for banning assault weapons, yes or no?"" Ask them. If the answer is no, vote against them.
Look, I'm prouder that, after 7 years, we finally have a Senate-confirmed Director of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, responsible for fighting gun crime. For 7 years, the other team would not let us appoint anyone to that jobincredibly important jobto help local law enforcement, Federal law enforcement, identify the ballistics, a whole range of things. For 7 years. We finally got it passed this time out, barely. Seven years, because didn't they didn't want anybody in that job. My plan gives the Bureau the funding to hire more agents, to stop gun trafficking.
And by the way, there's a lot of States that don't allow you to purchase certain weapons in the State. But just cross the State line and go buy it next door, bring it across the State line. Keep guns out ofyou know what the Mexicans areMexico, which has real problems, causing us real problemsyou know what their biggest complaint is? Can't we stop gungun trafficking across the southern border into Mexico.
There are certain gun dealers that are basicallynot gun dealers, they're wholesalers, providing the weapons to anybody who will have the money.
Folks, look, we can help local law enforcement. We can solve more gun crimes if we have thesomeone heading up, which we finally do, this organization that's designed to track this kind of behavior.
Finally, my plan invests in crime prevention programs that help keep young people from getting in trouble in the first place. Under my plan, communities can, one, provide after-school and summer job programs they get paid for. More access to mental health and drug counseling. More social workers and housing to keep people off the streets instead of when they get out ofwhen they get out of jail, they get 25 centdollars and a bus ticket, and they end up under the same bridge that they were under before. This will help prevent crime and get young people to pick up paychecks instead of a pistol.
At the same time, we need to help people getting out of prison successfully reenter society so they don't get in trouble again. If you served your time, you shouldn't be designyou shouldn't be deprived of being able toif you've served it, you shouldn't be deprived of being able to get a Pell grant to go to school. You shouldn't be able to[applause]to get a degree.
What's the best thing you can do? Make them productive. They should get access to good jobs where they can earn a decent living.
All these steps will prevent crime, not increase it.
Let me close with this: A safer America requires all of us to uphold the rule of law, not the rule of any one party or any one person. Let's be clear: You hear some of my friends in the other team talking about political violence and how it's necessary.
Think about this now. Did any of you think, even if you're as old as I am, you'veever been an election where we talk about it's appropriate to use forcepolitical violence in America? It's never appropriate. Never. Period. Never, never, never. No one should be encouraged to use political violence. None whatsoever.
And look, you know, if we're in a situation whereto this day, the MAGA Republicans in Congress defend the mob that stormed the Capitol on January 6. Defend them. You all saw it. I don't care how frustrated you are.
You know, when I showed up, one of the things I learned as President, even though I had been Vice President for 8 years and done a great deal on the foreign policy for the administrationI showed up at a meeting of the major democracies called the G-7. And I sat downit was in Englandand I sat down for this 3-day conference. And I said, ""America is back."" And Macron, the President of France, turned to me and said, ""For how long?"" ""For how long?"" Then we had a discussion with Schmidt [Scholz]* and all of themeverything. It just""For how long?""
And one of them said to me: ""Imagine, Joe, if you turned on the television in Washington, DC, and saw a mob of a thousand people storming down the hallways of the Parliament, breaking down the doors trying to overturn an outcome of election and killing several police officers in the meantime. Imagine. Imagine what you'd think.""
Think about what the world saw. Not what we saw, what the world saw. Did you ever think, in the United States, that would happen?
What I find even more incredible is the defense of it. Cops attacked and assaulted; speared with flagpolewith flagpoles; sprayed with mace; stomped on, dragged, brutalized. Police lost their lives as a result of that day. Police lost their lives. One of the officers said it was worse than anything he had experienced in war in Iraq.
So let me say this to my MAGA Republican friends in Congress: Don't tell me you support law enforcement if you won't condemn what happened on the 6th. Don't tell me. Can't do it. For God's sake, whose side are you on? Whose side are you on?
Look, you're either on the side of a mob or the side of the police. You can't be pro-law enforcement and pro-insurrection. You can't be a party of law and order and call the people who attacked the police on January 6 ""patriots."" You can't do it. What are we teaching our children? It's just that simple.
But now it's sickening to see the new attacks on the FBI, threatening the life of law enforcement agents and their families for simply carrying out the law and doing their job. Look, I want to say this clearly as I can: There is no place in this countryno placefor endangering the lives of law enforcement. No place. None. Never. Period. I'm opposed to defending the police. I'm also opposed to defending the FBI.
Look, there's no greater responsibility for government than ensuring the safety of our people. Every parent should be able to know when theykid leaves home to go to school or just walk the street they're going to come home safely.
We can do this. We have to do this. We just need to remember who we are. We are the United States of America. And when we are united, there is not a single thing we cannot donot a single thing. I mean it.
So, folks, let's remember who in God's name we areI really mean itwhat our values are, what we believe. ""We, the People""that's how our Constitution startsor the Declaration. ""We, the People."" It's who we are.
And, by the way, no one expects politics to be a pattycake. It sometimes gets mean as hell. But the idea you turn on a television and see senior Senators and Congressmen saying, ""If such and such happens, there'll be blood in the street.""
Where the hell are we?
Audience member. Bring back common sense!
The President. Well, that's all I'm looking for.
And folks, do me a favor. [Laughter] Presumptuous of me to say that. But think about doing me a favor. Please, please elect the attorney general to the Senate [Governor].* Elect that big ole boy to be Governor.
And, by the way, there are a lot of reallyand I mean this, I'm not being solicitousremember what used to be the criticism of Biden when I was running? ""Biden is too bipartisan. Biden has too many Republican friends.""
There's a lot of Republicans I've worked with for all the years in the Senate. I got a lot done. We respected each other. When we disagreed, we disagreed on principle, but we then went and had lunch together. Not a joke.
What in God's name has happened to that in the United States of America? So, folks, let's bring it back. We can do this.
God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

The President. I haven't seen the report on Mar-a-Lago, so I'm not commenting. I haven't seen it, number one. But I do want to say we had a great economic report today.
Last month, minus-1 inflation. Not up, notdown. Actually down. The economy is looking good. So far, we're hanging in, and I feel good about it. But we've got a long way to go.
Q. Is it possible that
Student Loan Debt Relief 
Q. Mr. President, if only 75 percent of the people take advantage of the student loan programdo you consider it a success if only 75 percent of the people take advantage of it?
The President. I'll consider it a success if only 10 percent take advantage of it. Look, people need help. And by the way, the end result of this isas I've met with everyone from the former Secretary of Treasury to everyone elsethis is not going to cause inflation, number one.
Number two, it would generate economic growththe oppositebecause you've got people who are, in fact, now going to be freed up to be able to go borrow money to buy a home, to be able to start businesses, to do the things that need to be done.
And I found it absolutely fascinating that some of the folks who were talking about ""this is big spending"" are the same people that got $158,000 in PPP money, including thewhat's her name? That woman who believes in theanyway. A whole lot of Republicans got a lot of money, the very people criticizing it.
So it's just notI think it's a good Education : Postsecondary education :: Federal student loans, partial forgiveness thing, it frees a lot of people up, it's going to grow the economy. We still have a way to go, but I'm optimistic.

The President's Handling of Classified Documents 
Q. Mr. President, in simple terms, is it ever appropriate for a President just to take home with them classified and top secret documents?
The President. Depending on the circumstance. For example, I have, in my home, a cabined-off space that is completely secure. I'm taking home with me today today's PDB. It's locked. I have a person with memilitary with me. I read it, I lock it back up, and give it to the military.

2022-08-26 00:00:00,Remarks in a Meeting on Reproductive Rights With State and Local Officials and an Exchange With Reporters,"
The President. Well, look, thanks for coming down. And I know you've been meeting with my staff
[At this point, the President cleared his throat.]
excuse meand I'm just aquote, a ""drop-by."" But I want to thank you for what you're doing and your focus.
Iyou know, thethe leadership of State and local officials on this issue is incredibly importantincredibly important.
And as I saidexcuse me forI have a throatfrog in my throat here.
[The President took a sip of water.]
As I said, the Court got Roe right for nearly 50 years. And Congress, in my view, shouldcodify Roe foronce and for all. But right now we're short a handful of votes. And it passed the House, but in the Senate, we're short. And the only way it's going to happen is if the American people make it happen in November.
Remember that line in the court casein the Dobbs case saying that women can speak? Well, they have no idea about whoyou're going to hear women roar on this issue, and it's going to be consequential. So I'm optimistic that we'll get to a place where we're already making your voices heard, like you saw what happened with Pat Ryan up in New York picking up that district.
I think you'reI think the American people realize this is just beyond the pale. It'sit goes too far. In the meantime, I signed two Executive orders to protect access to reproductive health care, including emergency medical care, and to protect a woman's right to travel to get health care she needs. And I think one that's going to turn out to be as consequential as anything we've done is to protect her right to privacy so they can't access that information.
And we also just had a big district court win in Idaho. And so I'm here today to hear what you think, what you guys are doing. And so I'm going to, as they say, yield the floor.
And I want toI came do a little listening, if I could, if that's all right.
Director of the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs Julie Rodriguez. Yes. Thank you, Mr. President. We wanted to maybe first hear from the mayor of Durham, North CarolinaMayor O'Nealwho's joined us today.
The President. Madam Mayor.
Mayor Elaine M. O'Neal of Durham, NC. Mr. President, I'm so happy to be here today and on this special day. This is Women's Equality Day. And in North Carolina, we are still a relatively safe-haven State for a woman's right to choose. But where it is a threat anywhere it is a threat for everybody.
And so today, in North Carolina, we stand ready to help change the narrative. I do you believe that it is time for us to talk about the encroachmentor nonencroachmentof reproductive rights for men.
The conversation in this arena has been primarily focused in on women's reproductive rights. But there are two partners when it comes to pregnancy, and we should look and see what the other side can contribute in this conversation when it comes to reproductive freedoms.
We are all at a crucial state in our Nation in a number of arenas, but the right to choose is a fundamental right in so many areas. And when it is threatened, we must all pitch in to make sure that it's balanced.
I'm a former judge. I was a sitting judge for 24 years at the State court. And so balancing and fairness is very important to me and my State and my city. And so I'm here today to try to tell us we must talk about the reproductive freedoms that men have that women do not currently enjoy.
Director Rodriguez. Thank you so much.
The President. Tell me how you do that. Now, I understand itI mean, it's clear in its face you're accurate. But how, in making the case of the freedom men havewhat do you do toother than to sort of embarrass men intogetting into theinto the argument and voting the right way on this issue?
Mayor O'Neal. Well, I think that you can primarily listI think one of my colleagues here this morning mentioned Viagra. If you start to talk about taking away the rights of men to take it, then what do we have? Or if we think about the fact that there are medical procedures that men can have as wellbecause an abortion is a medical procedurethere are medical procedures that men can have that will help them not to contribute to the making of a child.
So there has to be some discussions about why that is not a part of the conversation. Why is it solely focused on a woman? And I think just having a conversation causes people to kind of rethink and reshape that narrative. And we don't talk about that because those are very personal and intimate issues. But I do believe that it is a must that we focus in on what men can do to contribute physically to the making of a child or not making of a child.
The President. Okay.
Director Rodriguez. Thank you, Mayor. And next, we wanted to hear from Judge Hidalgo from Harris County, Texas. Judge?
County Judge Lina Hidalgo of Harris County, TX. Mr. President, as you know, I'm a county executive in Houston. And it was tragic: Just yesterday the trigger law in Texas came into effect. And it means that abortion is banned from the time of fertilization and that anyone who performs an abortion could be charged with a felony, and the penalty could be up to life in prison. And so, as we celebrate Women's Equality Day, we have everything but equality when it comes to this issue.
I'm hearing a lot of concern from our doctors in the community. Our public hospital system provides abortions when they're medically necessary. And those doctors are telling us they're not going to be able to determine anymore when it is legal to provide an abortion, because the law in Texas has no exemptions for rape or incest; only allows an abortion exception when the life of the mother is in danger or they're at danger of irreparable harm.
So how do you determine that if you're a doctor? And they're agonizing over it. They're agonizing about whether they protect a life or put themselves at severe legal jeopardy.
So we've worked to invest funds in some of thesome of the American Rescue Plan funds into tackling maternal mortality in Harris County. We already have the highest maternal mortality in Texas. Certainly, compared to the rest of the country, it's very, very high, and this will only exacerbate the problem.
Abortions aren't going anywhere. They're just going to become a bigger threat. And look, I've dealt with fires, flood, pandemic, the winter freeze we had in Texas. You visited, Mr. President, right after that tragedy.
The President. That's where I saw you last.
Judge Hidalgo. A lot of that[laughter]it was wonderful to have you, Mr. President. And look, a lot of thatperhaps the winter freeze is an exceptionthey're natural disasters. This is a man-made disaster that we have in Texas. It's a man-made disaster.
And we've got to change it, as you say, at the ballot box. But look, we have that, we have a bounty law, and we have a legislative session that's going to start in January where they're looking at tackling contraceptionaccess to contraception. They're already talked about banning thatbanning the pill that helps women seek abortion who can't make it to a clinic physically; that would make it even harder for women to travel.
A woman in Houston would have to travel 600 miles to get to the nearest abortion clinic in New Mexico. And so we need help figuring out how to get women to be able to seek that abortion, to travel to these States that are offering us safe havens.
We need funding for additional support for contraception, for reproductive health care. We're using our local funding to additionally support those women, to tackle maternal mortality with some of the funds you guys have sent. But it's a difficult day for women in Texas.
And I will say, I speak this as the only woman leading the largest county in the State of Texas, third largest in the country. And I am not out of step with the women of Texas, because the vast majority of Texans are opposed to this extreme law andwhich I refuse to call partisan, because it is extreme. And all of us can join in determining that.
And so I speak for myself, I speak for women in Harris County, and I speak for the majority of Texans when I say this law has no place, and it's a slap in the face to do this the day before Women's Equality Day.
The President. I think you speak for women all over America. I think you speak for beyond women. I think you speak for the majority of the American people.
This isthe idea that there are no exceptions made as well is just not something thatyou see what thewhat the voteswho knows what happens in November, but you see what some of the votes that have occurred, that have taken place in the lastthe last couple months here in the United States in various localities. The American peopleI think this is above and beyond where everybody thought they'dwe'd go.
Mayor Shawyn Patterson-Howard of Mount Vernon, NY. Thank you so much, Mr. President, for
Director Rodriguez. Oh
The President. Oh, I'm sorry.
Director Rodriguez. Oh no, that's okay.
The President. I took control. I shouldn't do that.
Director Rodriguez. No problem, Mr. President.
The President. I'm not allowed to do that. Go ahead. You tell me.
Director Rodriguez. I think we're going to go ahead and have the rest of the conversation closed press. So thank you all so much.

And this NATO summit that we're attending, in terms of its agenda, is going to be quite busy, and it's going to be quite important. And tomorrow the activities will be sustained. And thanks to our efforts, we believe that we will be able to go back to our countries with our hands full and with full satisfaction.
And as the United States, we think your pioneering in this regard is going to be crucial in terms of strengthening NATO for the future, and it's going to have a very positive contribution to the process between Ukraine and Russia.
The Russia and Ukraine conflict and the negative developments with regards to taking out of the grain from the Ukrainian ports, as well as the developments involving oil and natural gas, require all of us to work together in order to settle the disputes once and for all.
I hope and pray that we will be able to establish a balance to diplomacy in order to cultivate positive results, especially with regards to the grain. There are countries deprived of the grains, and we will open corridors, and we will allow them to have access to the grains that they so need.

2022-06-29 00:00:00,"Remarks Prior to a Meeting With President Yoon Suk Yeol of South Korea and Prime Minister Fumio Kishida of Japan in Madrid, Spain","
President Biden. Well, it's great to be here again with President Yoon following our detailed and productive conversations in Seoul last month and also to be joined by Prime Minister Kishida, who I visited in Tokyo last month and spent the last few days in Germany with, at the G-7.
And this is an opportunity to further coordinate our trilateral efforts, specifically with regard to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Our trilateral cooperation, in my view, is essential to achieving our shared objective, including a complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and a free and open Indo-Pacific.
I look forward to additional dialogues in this format as we continue to strengthen our trilateralour trilateralengagement. And we remain deeply concerned at the D.P.R.K.'s continued escalatory ballistic missiles and tests and potential forto conduct a nuclear test.
I'm particularly pleased that this meeting is taking place on the margins of this historic NATO summit and that, for the first time, it includes Indo-Pacific partners of Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and the Korean Republic, andexcuse me, the Republic of Korea. And the attendance of all four of these leaders highlights the global resolve to hold Russia accountable for its brutal and unprovoked war in Ukraine and our shared determination to defend the rules-based international order.
And with that, I'd like to turn to President Yoon. And the floor is yours, sir.
President Yoon. In conjunction with the NATO summit, I find it deeply meaningful that we, as leaders of the Republic of Korea, the United States, and Japan, came together. I extend my sincere appreciation to President Biden for hosting this summit, and I am delighted to meet Prime Minister Kishida once again.
The D.P.R.K.'s nuclear and missile threats continue to evolve, and the global landscape is facing increased uncertainties, thereby rendering our trilateral partnership all the more significant.
In almost 5 years, the R.O.K.-U.S.-Japan summit is reconvening, indicating the three nations' commitment to enhancing their cooperation in order to tackle regional and global issues. I hope that our meeting today will position R.O.K.-U.S.-Japan partnership as yet another central pillar for global peace and stability.
Prime Minister Kishida. I am deeply concerned over the possibility of further provocation by North Korea, including nuclear testing. As confirmed on the occasion of President Biden's visit to Japan and to the R.O.K., the deterrence capabilities of the Japan-U.S. and U.S.-R.O.K. alliances need to be upgraded as part of the essential effort to strengthen the trilateral partnership between Japan, the U.S., and R.O.K.
From such perspective and for other reasons, this trilateral summit is being organized at a timely juncture. Through this meeting, I hope that trilateral cooperation regarding our response to North Korea will be solidified.
I very much welcome the prompt response by the Japan-U.S. and U.S.-R.O.K. alliances against ballistic missiles launched by North Korea, and the agreement reached at the recent trilateral ministerial meeting between Defense Ministers to conduct trilateral missile warning and ballistic missile search-and-tracking exercises is welcomed.
In the case a nuclear test is performed, I hope that response can be taken at the trilateral level, including joint exercises. In order to strengthen the deterrence and response capabilities of our alliance with the U.S., Japan will fundamentally reinforce our defense capabilities.
And, Joe, President Yoon, I am deeply grateful for your support towards the immediate solution of the abduction issue, and I ask you for your continued understanding and cooperation.

2022-06-29 00:00:00,"Remarks at a Greeting With Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Madrid, Spain","
President Biden. Well, Jens, thank you very much for having me this morning. And, you know, we've got a big agenda, and great to be with you to kick off theI think is a history-making summit. And we talked about this for a year, and now we're here.
Our meetings todaywe're going to approve a new NATO Strategic Concept and reaffirm the unity and determination of our alliance to defend every inch of NATO territory. And article 5 is sacrosanct, and we mean it when we say, ""An attack against one is an attack against all""every inch.
And so, at this summit, the full alliance is going to welcome Finland and Sweden, their historic application for membership. And their decision to move away from neutrality and the tradition of neutrality to join NATO alliance is going to make us stronger and more secure, and NATO stronger.
We're sending an unmistakable message, in my viewand I think yours as wellthat NATO is strong, united, and the steps we're taking during this summit are going to further augment our collective strength.
To that end, today I'm announcing the United States will enhance our force posture in Europe and respond to the changed security environment, as well as strengthening our collective security.
Earlier this year, we surged 20,000 additional U.S. forces to Europe to bolster our alliance in response to Russia's aggressive move, bringing our force total in Europe to 100,000. We're going to continue to adjust our posture based on the threat, in close consultation with our allies.
Here in Spain, we're going to work with our ally to increase U.S. Navy destroyers stationed in Spain's Rota naval base from three tofrom four to six destroyers. In Poland, we're going to establish a permanent headquarters for the U.S. Fifth Army Corps andstrengthening our U.S.-NATO interoperability across the entire eastern flank.
We're going to maintain additional rotational brigadewhich is 3,000 fighters and another 2,000 personnelcombat team here in Europe, headquartered in Romania. And we're going to enhance our rotational deployments in the Baltic States. And we're going to send two additional F-35 squadrons to the U.K. and station additional air defense and other capabilities in Germany and in Italy.
And together, our allieswe're going to make sure that NATO is ready to meet threats from all directions, across every domain: land, air, and the sea.
In a moment when Putin has shattered peace in Europe and attacked the very, very tenets of a rule-based order, the United States and our allies, we're going to step up. We're stepping up. We're proving that NATO is more needed now than it ever has been and it's as important as it has ever been.
So I want to thank you, Jens, for leading the alliance through this crisis and for your work to strengthen NATO for all the challenges that lie ahead. And I genuinely look forward to our discussion today.
And, again, thank you for your leadership. It's important.
Secretary General Stoltenberg. Thank you so much, President Biden, dear Joe. It's really great to see you here in Madrid so soon after we met in the White House in Washington. And thank you for your personal leadership and the U.S. commitment to NATO, to European security demonstrated by the announcementthe announcements you just made to further increase U.S. presence in Europe.
And this really demonstrates your decisive leadership in strengthening the transatlantic bond, and we also see that in the unwavering support from you and from the United States to Ukraine. That will be a main issue at the summit today.
We'll meet with President Zelenskyy. He will address the summit. And as you said, this will be an historic summit. It will be a transformative summit where we will make decisions that will actually change this alliance for many years to come.
We will agree a new Strategic Concept, the blueprint for NATO into the future: a more dangerous world, a more competitive world. We will agree the biggest overhaul of our collective defense deterrence since the end of the cold war, and the U.S. is, of course, very much part of that.
And then we will invite Finland and Sweden to join NATO. And that demonstrates that NATO's door is open. It demonstrates that President Putin has not succeeded in closing NATO's door. He is getting the opposite of what he wants. He wants less NATO; President Putin is getting more NATO by Finland and Sweden joining our alliance.
And we will agree a comprehensive assistance package for Ukraine. And then I also welcome the fact that we are able now to state that actually, that European allies and Canada are stepping up with more troops, higher readiness, and also increased defense spending. New figures shows that they have added 350 billion extra U.S. dollars for defense since we made the pledge back in 2014.
So, all in all, this demonstrates unity and the strength of our alliance. So thank you, Joe.
President Biden. Well, you know, I was asked about this oneabout Finland and Swedenwhen each of their leaders came to the White House. And I said Putin was looking for the ""Finlandization"" of Europe. He's going to get the ""NATO-ization"" of Europe. And that's exactly what he didn't want, but exactly what needs to be done to guarantee security for Europe.
And I think it's necessary, and I'm looking forward to it happening formally.
Secretary General Stoltenberg. Thank you so much again.
President Biden. Thank you.
Secretary General Stoltenberg. Thank you.

King Felipe. Mr. President, welcome. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
[At this point, King Felipe made remarks in Spanish; no translation was provided. He then continued in English as follows.]
Mr. President, as I said earlier on when I welcomed you at the Torrejn Air Force Base, it is truly a pleasure to welcome you to Spain, to our nation's capital, Madrid.
We've had the opportunity actually to meet on previous occasions, in our previous capacities as well. [Laughter] And I always treasure those opportunities in my memory. And we've had chances to talk in theabout things in the past, and I really look forward to do that on this occasion as well.
The Kingdom of Spain and the United States of America share profound historical and cultural tieswe all know that inside outand we're very proud of them. But more importantly, we share common values and principles that are, today, the foundation of a rich and wide-ranging relationship and a sincere friendship which we highly value and which we want to continue strengthening every day.
President Biden and his delegation, with Secretary Blinken ahead of itto which we also extend a warm welcomeare visiting us to attend a very important NATO summit here in Madrid. This is without a doubt an especially relevant summit, one in which the allied countries must continue to show unity and determination to defend our freedom and our democratic values.
Mr. President, Queen Letizia and I, our Government, the Spanish people are all delighted to have you here with us, together with your delegation and together with your wife, the First Lady, Dr. Jill Biden. And we wish you a very happy, albeit short, stay in Madrid.
Thank you very much.
President Biden. Thank you very much. Well, thank you Your Majesty. There's an old expression in a little town in Delaware called Claymont, Delaware, a little steel town. And they say: ""We're like poor relatives. We show up when we're invited, and we stay longer than we should."" So be careful. We may not go back. [Laughter] This is my second opportunity to be in this magnificent facility. And it'sthe royal palace is just incredible.
And notwithstanding the majesty of this palace, we do haveshare the same values. As a matter of fact, some suggest we wouldn't be an independent country were it not for you guys some years ago. Andbut I've traveled to Madrid as Vice President. And quite frankly, it's wonderful to return here again to discuss the consequences of what particularly is happening today in the world.
This iswe're at a moment of historicalan inflection point in Americanin world history. Things are changing. They're changing drastically not only in terms of the politics of the world, but everything from pandemic diseases to dealing with everything from climate change.
And so I want to thank you for hosting this NATO meeting because it's been almost40 years; 40 years now you've all been members of NATO. And we're all better off for it. All of us.
And today, NATO is united and as united and galvanized as, I believe, it's ever been. And we are ready to face the threats of Russian aggression, because quite frankly, there's no choice. It's been athe most significant abuse of power since World War II and an invasion of that many people into another country in Europe. Some people thought that was not likely to happen again, but it did.
But we responded. We responded in unison. And when we agreed we were going to respond, we acknowledged there was going to be some costs to our people. They were going toin usour imposition of sanctions on Russia.
But our people have stood together. They stood up, and they've stood strong. And you know, as I told President Snchez, who I met with a moment ago, thatI want to thank you, Your Highness, for the support of the Spanish people, and not only as it relates to what is going on in Europe andbut what's happening in North Africa, as well as Latin America. The help and support and the input has been extremely valuable.
You know, I tell people that the ideawe've alwayswe've had great migrations, flows into the United States over the years. We're a nation of immigrants. But an interesting statistic, Your Highness, thatI think it's 24 out of every 100 students in grade 1 through 12 in America speaks Spanishspeaks Spanishas their original language. And so the future of my country depends considerably on the assimilation of a population that is going to have all the same values that we possess and have.
And your help in Latin America is also extremely important, and I look forward tofrom here toand Europe to Latin America, to the Caribbean, to Africa. The partnership between our countries is going to determine a goodlarge part how well things look 10 years from now and 15 years from now.
So we have to stay together. The unity is important. And I think we're off to a very, very good start demonstrating the power of democracies in the second quarter of the 21st century, because there is a contest between autocracies and democracies, and we have to succeed. And I'm confident we will with your help.
Thank you.

"
2022-06-28 00:00:00,"Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Prime Minister Pedro Snchez Perez-Castejon of Spain in Madrid, Spain","
Prime Minister Snchez. Good afternoon, and welcome to Madrid. I would like to start by thanking President Biden for coming to Spain to participate in the Madrid NATO summit. I'm also very, very glad to welcome you in the Moncloa Palace in your first visit as President of United States.
[At this point, Prime Minister Snchez spoke in Spanish, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
Spain and the U.S. are allies. We are strategic partners. We are friends. We are linked together by strong historical bonds and strong partnership in many topics. And moreover, we share that desire to promote the principles of freedom, democracy, human rights, gender equality, and the state of law.
And after over 20 years since the declaration that was signed by the Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and the then-Foreign Affairs Minister of Spain Josep Piqu in 2001, there's obviously been numerous changes that have affected transatlantic relations and relations between Spain and the U.S. And that is, dear Mr. President, why I'm so happy to announce this new joint declaration between the U.S. and Spain, which will help to strengthen the relations between Spain and the U.S.
In this declaration, we are doing a lot of different things. First of all, we are reinforcing our support for a rules-based international order. And it's very important to say that today here in Madrid as a consequence of the holding of the NATO summit here because Putin's invasion of Ukraine is a clear violation of international law, a direct attack on our shared values, and it demonstrates the need to redouble our efforts to support that rules-based international order.
And one of the main consequences of Putin's war has actually been the revitalization of the transatlantic alliance. When Europe's security was at stake, what every ally has done, including Spain, has been to respond decisively, reinforcing our eastern flank whilst recognizing the threats that come from the southern flank and, therefore, the importance for the alliance to develop everything that's been called the ""alliance 360 strategy.""
And Spain has practically, dear Mr. President, doubled its military presence in Latvia with the recent deployment this very week of an anti-air defense system in the Lielvarde Air Force Base. The Spanish contingent in Latvia is now 592. And we're also taking part in the Baltic air police patrols. Our navy ships are maintaining their presence in the alliance's permanent forces. And so, in total, Spain is participating with its deployments in five NATO missions with a total of 1,471 forces deployed.
And in this context in which we're dealing, I think, with the biggest challenge to peace in Europe since the end of the cold war, today the U.S. and Spain have committed to strengthen our cooperation in the areas of defense and security. Specifically, we have spoken about the U.S.'s interest in increasing its presence in Rota's Navy Base in order to strengthen the alliance's collective security.
And on the other hand, and as is set down in the joint declaration, we have agreed to strengthen the bonds between us in the areas of justice, cybersecurity, energy securityand by the way, I'm very grateful to the U.S. Government and the whole of the U.S. for all that LPG that we are receiving in Spainand also the management of immigration flows, everything that has to do with climate change, technology, and digital transformation.
So, in this update of this joint declaration that was signed back in 2001, we are expanding and reinforcing our bilateral relations. And we're also, of course, aware of the importance of the trade relations between our economies. And in our respective national recovery plans, we see an excellent opportunity for U.S. companies in Spain and Spanish companies in the U.S.
And in that context, I would like to thank President Biden for his role in redefining the transatlantic trade relations, which, over the last year, have been able to resolve past differences and embark on a much more positive track, forgetting that past and looking towards the future with hope.
We also agree on the importance of promoting a positive agenda in Latin America, a region whichin the most part, a region with shared values. And together, we will be able to better defend a rules-based international order.
Together, we've also discussed the increasing challenges of a very important region for Spain and Europe, which is the Sahel; also the role of China in the current geopolitical context, which will be discussed in the NATO summit.
So we will continue to work together in multilateral fora, like the U.N. and the G-20, in order to promote a coordinated response to all the global challenges we have, including climate emergency, food security, or the architecture of global health after the COVID-19 pandemic.
So, overall, this visit, dear Mr. President, has been a significant turning point in the bilateral relations between our two countries.
[Prime Minister Snchez continued his remarks in English, concluding as follows.]
Allow me to finish by thanking you for your leadership. We are pleased to have the U.S. back on the side of multilateralism. The Madrid NATO summit will start tomorrow, and the decisions that we will take will reinforce our transatlantic bond. You can count on Spain as a solid ally and friend.
And thank you very much, Mr. President.
President Biden. Well, thank you, Pedro. You can count on us as well. And you know, thank you for welcoming me today here and for hosting the NATO summit in Madrid. And we have awe had a very warm and personal discussion upstairs. And one of the things I look forward to is having an hour together before we begin the whole conference.
You know, we're marking 40 years40 yearssince Spain joined NATO in becoming an indispensable ally. And today, we're standing together to defend our shared securityand I emphasize shared security; strengthen our transatlantic alliance; and meet the challenge we face today and in the future. That's one of the things we're going to be talking about in this meeting this week.
And as President Snchez and I want to talk to youthank you for Spain's hospitality for U.S. servicemembers and their families stationed here in Spain.
Mr. President, you're hosting a truly historic summit and the key moment in our alliance when Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine wasshattered peace in Europe and shattered every norm since World War II that's has been in place. And I want to thank you personallyyoufor your leadership.
Transatlantic unity has been and will continue to be the greatest strength in our response to Russiatransatlantic security. We're standing as one to support Ukraine and to enhance our own deterrence and defense capabilities.
And as I said before the war started: If Putin attacked Ukraine, United States would enhance our force posture in Europe and respond to the reality of a new European security environment.
Earlier this year, we surged additional U.S. forces to Europe to bolster our alliance in response to Russia's aggressive actions. And for months, we've been consulting closely on additional steps the United States will take alongside our allies, who are also stepping up and strengthening our selective and collective security.
Together, the new commitments will constitute an impressive display of allied unity and resolve and NATO's 360-degree approach to our security.
I'm looking forward to discussing all of this during the summit. But, Mr. President, you and I discussed today, we're going to work on an agreement to increase the number of U.S. naval destroyers stationed at Spain's Rota Naval Base, which will also enhance the bilateral defensive relationship between Spain and the United States. We expect that to occur much sooner than later.
And I welcome the steps that Spain has taken in solidarity with our allies that we're facing heightened threats on their borders, including sending additional capabilities you referenced to Latvia. Thank you, Mr. President.
And I'll be laying out additional steps the United States is going to take with our NATO colleagues as ourin our summit tomorrow.
But the bottom line is this: Together, the alliance is threatening its postureis dealing with the threats and strengthening our posture against the threats from the east and challenges from the south. NATO is focused on all directions and domains: land, air, and sea.
And, Mr. President, we also discussed how the United States and Spain and other allies are keeping needed weapons and equipment flowing to Ukraine so theythey're standing up in ways that I don't think anyone anticipated, showing enormous bravery, enormous resolve. And we're continuing to tighten sanctions on Russia as well.
We're providing assistance to the Government and the people of Ukraine as they respond to this unprovoked assault on their lives and their democracies. Sometimes, I think Putin's objective is just to literally change the entire culture, wipe out the culture of Ukrainethe kinds of actions he's taking.
And I want to particularly thank you, Mr. President, and the people of Spain for the support you've shown in welcoming more than 140,000 Ukrainian citizens refuge here in Spain. That's remarkable and a testament to your people. And it's a testament to the spirit and resolve of not only the Spanish people, but of your leadership and to stand up for what is right at a moment of crisis.
Our shared democratic values, together with our long history of friendship, make Spain and the United States strong partners on all the issues that we face together. In the Western Hemisphere, Spain and the United States are working together with other countries in the Latin and Caribbean areas to reinforce democratic institutions, strengthen the rule of law, spread economic prosperity, and advanced transformative approaches to manage migration.
We're looking to do more together in Africa as well to promote stability and economic growth. And we reaffirmed our joint commitment today to continue to work together on the biggest challenges that affect the people all around the world, from COVID-19 to climate change.
And we're releasing a joint declaration that reaffirms our shared values, reflects the full breadth of our cooperation. And we have asked our teams to follow up on the substance of the joint declaration so they become known to everyone.
And so thank you, again, Pedro, for your friendship and your close partnership. And we had a good discussion today, and I'm looking forward to continue good discussions in the remainder of this conference. But thank you for your hospitality. It's unmatched.

2022-06-26 00:00:00,"Remarks at the Launch of the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment in Krn, Germany","
Thank you very much. Well, good afternoon, folks.
Our nations and our world stand at a genuine inflection point in history. Technology has made our world smaller, more immediate, and more connected. It's opened up incredible opportunities, but also accelerated challenges that impact on all of us: managing global energy needs, taking on the climate crisis, dealing with the spread of diseases.
And the choices we make now, in my view, are going to set a direction of our world for several generations to come. These challenges are hard for all of us, even nations with resources of the G-7. But developing countries often lack the essential infrastructure to help navigate global shocks like a pandemic. So they feel the impacts more acutely, and they have a harder time recovering.
In our deeply connected world, that's not just a humanitarian concern, it's an economic and a security concern for all of us. That's why, 1 year ago, when this group of leaders met in Cornwall, we made a commitment: The democratic nations of the G-7 would step upstep up and provide financing for quality, high-standard, sustainable infrastructure in developing and middle-income countries.
What we're doing is fundamentally different because it's grounded on our shared values of all those representing the countries and organizations behind me. It's built using the global best practices: transparency, partnership, protections for labor and the environment.
We're offering better options for countries and for people around the world to invest in critical infrastructure that improves the livestheir lives, all of our livesand delivers real gains for all of our people, not just the G-7all of our people. Today we officially launch the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment. We collectively have dozens of projects already underway around the globe.
And I'm proud to announce the United States will mobilize $200 billion in public and private capital over the next 5 years for that partnership. We're here today because we're making this commitment together as a G-7 in coordination with one another to maximize the impact of our work. Collectively, we aim to mobilize nearly $600 billion from the G-7 by 2027.
These strategic investments are areas ofcritical to sustainable development and to our shared global stability: health and health security, digital connectivity, gender equality and equity, climate and energy security. Let me give you some examples of the kinds of projects that are underway in each of these areas.
First, health. Two years ago, COVID-19didn't need any reminders about how critical investments in health care systems were and healthand health security is, both to fight the pandemic and to prepare for the next one, because it will not be the last pandemic we underwe have to deal with.
That's why the United States, together with the G-7 partners and the World Bank, are investing in a new industrial-scale vaccine manufacturing facility in Senegal. When complete, it will have the potential to produce hundreds of millions of doses of vaccine annually for COVID-19 and other diseases.
It's an investment that will enhance global vaccine supplies as well as improve access and equity for developing countries.
Second, in the digital area. Our economies' future increasingly depends on people's ability to connect to secure information and communications technologies. And we need to strengthen the use of trusted technologies so that our online information cannot be used by autocrats to consolidate their power or repress their people. That's why the Digital Invest Program is mobilizing $335 million in private capital to supply secure network equipment in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.
And the U.S. Government also supported the successful bid by an American company, SubCom, for a $600 million contract to build a global subsea telecommunications cable. This cable will stretch from Southeast Asia, through the Middle East and the Horn of Africa, to Europe. This will be essential to meeting the growing demand for reliable security, high-tech connectivity in three key regions of the world.
Third, gender. When women and girls have the ability and the opportunity to participate more fully in those societies and economies, we see positive impacts not only in their communities, but around the boardacross the board.
We have to increase those opportunities, though, for women and girls to thrive, including practical steps to make childcare more accessible and affordable as we continue the vital work to protect and advance women's fundamental rights.
The United States is committing $50 million over 5 years to the World Bank global Childcare Incentive Fund. This public-private partnership supported by several G-7 partners will help countries build infrastructure that makes it easier for women to participate equallyequallyin the labor force.
Fourth, and very important, climate and energy. We're seeing just how critical this is every day. The entire world is feeling the impact of Russia's brutal war in Ukraine and on our energy markets. We need worldwide effort to invest in transformative clean energy projects to ensure that critical infrastructure is resilient to changing climate. Critical materials that are necessary for our clean energy transition, including the production of batteries, need to be developed with high standards for labor and the environment.
Fast and reliable transportation infrastructure, including railroads and ports, is essential to moving inputs for refining and processing and expanding access to clean energy technologies. For example, the U.S. Government just facilitated a new partnership between two American firms and the Government of Angola to invest $2 billion in building anew solar projects in Angola. It's a partnership that will help Angola meet its climate goals and energy needs while creating new markets for American technologies and good jobs in Angola and, I suspect, throughout Africa.
And in Romania, the American company, NuScale Power, will build a first-of-its-kind small modular reactor plant. This will help bring on line zero-emission nuclear energy to Europe faster, more cheaply, and more efficiently. The U.S. Government is helping to advance the development of this groundbreaking American technology, which will strengthen Europe's energy security and create thousands of jobs in Romania and the United States.
These deals are just some of what's in store. And we're ready. We're ready to get to work, together, all of us. To lead effortsto lead U.S. efforts, in my caseappointedI appointed Amos Hochstein, my Special Presidential Coordinator, to deal with the rest of our colleagues. I'll [He'll]* lead the U.S. whole-of-Government approach to drive a coalition and a collaboration with the G-7 and our partners around the world, including private sector and multilateral development banks.
I want to be clear: This isn't aid or charity; it's an investment that will deliver returns for everyone, including the American people and the people of all our nations. It will boost all of our economies, and it's a chance for us to share our positive vision for the future and let communities around the world see themselvesand see for themselves the concrete benefits of partnering with democracies.
Because when democracies demonstrate what we can do, all that we have to offer, I have no doubt that we'll win the competition every time.
Thank you. And now I invite President von der Leyen to the podium.

Yesterday I spoke about the Supreme Court's shocking decision striking down Roe v. Wade. We've had a lot of discussion about that in our whole household. We think it's aanyway.
Jill and I know how painful and devastating the decision is for so many Americans, and I mean so many Americans. The decision is implemented by States. My administration is going to focus on how they administer it and whether or not they violate other laws, like deciding to not allow people across State lines to get public health services. And we're going to take actions to protect women's rights and reproductive health.
Bipartisan Safer Communities Act 
This morning, though, I'm herewe're here toon a critical issue: gun violence. You know, I'm about to sign into law a bipartisan safetygun safety legislation. And time is of the essence. Lives will be saved.
When we return from Europe, Jill and I will be hosting an event in the White House on July 11 to mark this historic achievement with Members who voted for these families and the families who, in fact, were victimized by the gun shooting that we've seen thisso incredible to see so much of it of late.
And advocates have worked really hard to do something about it. I've been at this work for a long, long time, and I know how hard it is, and I know what it takes to get it done. It was thereI was there 30 years ago, the last time this Nation passed meaningful gun safety laws. And I'm here today for the most significant law to be passed since then, sincefor the last 30 years.
I'd like to thank the leaders and Members of the House and Senate for working together to get this done. I especially want to thank the families that Jill and Imany of whom we sat with for hours on end across the country. So many we've gotten to know who lost their souls and theto an epidemic of gun violence. They lost their child, their husband, their wife. Nothing is going to fill that void in their hearts, but they led the way so other families will not have the experience and the pain and trauma that they had to live through.
From Columbine to Sandy Hook, to Charleston, Orlando, Las Vegas, Parkland, El Paso, Atlanta, Buffalo, Uvalde, and for the shootings that happen every day in the streets that are mass shootingsand we don't even hear about them, the number of people killed every day in the streetstheir message to us was: ""Do something."" How many times we heard that? ""Just do something."" For God's sake, just do something.
Well, today we did. While this bill doesn't do everything I want, it does include actions I've long called for that are going to save lives. It funds crisis intervention, including ""red flag"" laws. It keeps guns out of the hands of people who are a danger to themselves and to others. And it finally closes what is known as the ""boyfriend loophole."" So if you assault your boyfriend or girlfriend, you can't buy a gun or own a gun.
It requires young people ages 18 to 21 to undergo enhanced background checks. It includes the first-ever Federal law that makes gun trafficking and straw purchases distinct Federal crimes for the first time. It clarifies who needs to register as a federally licensed gun dealer and run background checks before selling a single weapon.
You know, this isalso provides historic funding to address the youth mental health crisis in this country, especiallyespeciallythe trauma experienced by the survivors of this gun violence.
Look, you know, it invests in antiviolence programs that workthat work directly with the people who are most likely to commit these crimes or become victims of gun crimes. Today we say more than ""enough."" We say more than ""enough."" It's timewhen it seems impossible to get anything done in Washington, we are doing something consequential. If we can reach compromise on guns, we ought to be able to reach compromise in other critical issues, from veterans' health care to cutting-edge American innovation and so much more.
I know there's much more work to do, and I'm never going to give up. But this is a monumental day. God bless us with the strength to continue to work to get the work that's left undone done, and the lives lost that can't be saved that obviously are gone, but will be an inspiration for us to do more.
I'm now going to sign this bill into law.
[At this point, the President signed the bill.]
God willing, it's going to save a lot of lives. Thank you all so very much.
Q. Mr. President, will you take a couple questions?
The President. No.
The First Lady. Congratulations.
The President. Thanks.
I have a helicopter waiting for me to take off. We're going to have plenty of time to talk about a lot of this.

2022-06-24 00:00:00,Remarks on the United States Supreme Court Decision To Overturn Roe v. Wade,"
The President. Today is ait's not hyperbole to suggest a very solemn moment. Today the Supreme Court of the United States expressly took away a constitutional right from the American people that it had already recognized.
They didn't limit it. They simply took it away. That's never been done to a right so important to so many Americans. But they did it. It's a sad day for the Court and for the country.
Fifty years ago, Roe v. Wade was decided and has been the law of the land since then. This landmark case protected a woman's right to choose, her right to make intensely personal decisions with her doctor, free from thefrom interference of politics.
It reaffirmed basic principles of equality: that women have the power to control their own destiny. And it reinforced the fundamental right of privacythe right of each of us to choose how to live our lives. Now, with Roe gone, let's be very clear: The health and life of women in this Nation are now at risk.
As chairman and ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, as Vice President and now as President of the United States, I've studied this case carefully. I've overseen more Supreme Court confirmations than anyone today, where this case was always discussed.
I believe Roe v. Wade was the correct decision as a matter of constitutional law, an application of the fundamental right to privacy and liberty in matters of family and personal autonomy.
It was a decision on a complex matter that drew a careful balance between a woman's right to choose earlier in her pregnancy and the State's ability to regulate later in her pregnancy. A decision with broad national consensus that most Americans of faiths and backgrounds found acceptable and that had been the law of the land for most of the lifetime of Americans today.
And it was a constitutional principle upheld by Justices appointed by Democrat and Republican Presidents alike. Roe v. Wade was a 7-to-2 decision written by a Justice appointed by a Republican President, Richard Nixon. In the five decades that followed Roe v. Wade, Justices appointed by Republican Presidentsfrom Eisenhower, Nixon, and Reagan, George W. Bush [George H.W. Bush]*were among the Justices who voted to uphold the principles set forth in Roe v. Wade.
It was three Justices named by one PresidentDonald Trumpwho were the core of today's decision to upend the scales of justice and eliminate a fundamental right for women in this country. Make no mistake: This decision is the culmination of a deliberate effort over decades to upset the balance of our law. It's a realization of an extreme ideology and a tragic error by the Supreme Court, in my view.
The Court has done what it has never done before: expressly take away a constitutional right that is so fundamental to so many Americans that had already been recognized. The Court's decision to do so will have real and immediate consequences. State laws banning abortion are automatically taking effect today, jeopardizing the health of millions of women, some without exceptions.
So extreme that women could be punished for protecting their health. So extreme that women and girls who are forced to bear their rapist's childof the child of consequence. It's ait just stuns me. So extreme that doctors will be criminalized for fulfilling their duty to care. Imagine havinga young woman having tocarry the child of incestas a consequence of incest. No option.
Too often the case that poor women are going to be hit the hardest. It's cruel.
In fact, the Court laid out State laws criminalizing abortion that go back to the 1800s[laughter]as a rationale, the Court literally taking America back 150 years.
This a sad day for the country, in my view, but it doesn't mean the fight's over.
Let me be very clear and unambiguous: The only way we can secure a woman's right to choose and the balance that existed is for Congress to restore the protections of Roe v. Wade as Federal law.
No executive action from the President can do that. And if Congress, as it appears, lacks the votethe votes to do that now, voters need to make their voices heard. This fall, we must elect more Senators and Representatives who will codify a woman's right to choose into Federal law once again, elect more State leaders to protect this right at the local level.
We need to restore the protections of Roe as law of the land. We need to elect officials who will do that. This fall, Roe is on the ballot. Personal freedoms are on the ballot. The right to privacy, liberty, equality, they're all on the ballot.
Until then, I will do all in my power to protect a woman's right in States where they will face the consequences of today's decision. While the Court's decision casts a dark shadow over a large swath of the land, many States in this country still recognize a woman's right to choose.
So if a woman lives in a State that restricts abortion, the Supreme Court's decision does not prevent her from traveling from her home State to the State that allows it. It does not prevent a doctor in that Statein that Statefrom treating her.
As the Attorney General has made clear, women must remain free to travel safely to another State to seek the care they need. And my administration will defend that bedrock right.
If any State or local official, high or low, tries to interfere with a woman's exercising her basic right to travel, I will do everything in my power to fight that deeply un-American attack.
My administration will also protect a woman's access to medications that are approved by the Food and Drug Administrationthe FDAlike contraception, which is essential for preventative health care; mifepristone, which the FDA approved 20 years ago to safely end early pregnancies and is commonly used to treat miscarriages.
Some States are saying that they'll try to ban or severely restrict access to these medications. But extremist Governors and State legislators who are looking to block the mail or search a person's medicine cabinet or control a woman's actions by tracking data on her apps she uses are wrong and extreme and out of touch with the majority of Americans.
The American Medical Association and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists wrote to me and Vice President Harris stressing that these laws are not based onare not based on evidence and asking us to act to protect access to care. They say by limiting access to these medicines, maternal mortality will climb in America. That's what they say.
Today I'm directing the Department of Health and Human Services to take steps to ensure these critical medications are available to the fullest extent possible and that politicians cannot interfere in the decisions that should be made between a woman and her doctor. And my administration will remain vigilant as the implications of this decision play out.
I've warned about how this decision risks the broader right to privacy for everyone. That's because Roe recognized the fundamental right to privacy that has served as the basis for so many more rights that we have come to takewe've come to take for granted that are ingrained in the fabric of this country: the right to make the best decisions for your health; the right to use birth controla married couplein the privacy of their bedroom, for God's sake; the right to marry the person you love.
Now, Justice Thomas said as much today. He explicitly called to reconsider the right of marriage equality, the right of couples to make their choices on contraception. This is an extreme and dangerous path the Court is now taking us on.
Let me close with two points. First, I call on everyone, no matter how deeply they care about this decision, to keep all protests peaceful. Peaceful, peaceful, peaceful. No intimidation. Violence is never acceptable. Threats and intimidation are not speech. We must stand against violence in any form regardless of your rationale.
Second, I know so many of us are frustrated and disillusioned that the Court has taken something away that's so fundamental. I know so many women are now going to face incredibly difficult situations. I hear you. I support you. I stand with you.
The consequences and the consensus of the American peoplecore principles of equality, liberty, dignity, and the stability of the rule of lawdemand that Roe should not have been overturned.
With this decision, the conservative majority of the Supreme Court shows how extreme it is, how far removed they are from the majority of this country. They have made the United States an outlier among developed nations in the world. But this decision must not be the final word.
My administration will use all of its appropriate lawful powers. But Congress must act. And with your vote, you can act. You can have the final word. This is not over.
Thank you very much. I'll have more to say on this in weeks to come. Thank you.
Q. Mr. President, do you still have confidence in this Court?

2022-06-23 00:00:00,Remarks Prior to a Meeting on the Federal-State Offshore Wind Implementation Partnership and an Exchange With Reporters,"
The President. I want to say to the press, we have an impressive group of Governors, labor leaders, and business leaders in the room here, but I'm not going to take the time to introduce everybody right now.
But let me just say thatat the outset herethat, you knowCabinet members, as wellthat I think we're at a place where we've reached an exciting point where it seems like there's been a coalescence of the notion that, you know, alternative energy makes sense, and wind is a gigantic piece of it.
I was in Colorado, and I actuallyI never thought I'd see a blade for a windmill that was 102 yards long. And you could literally pick up the end of it, it wasI mean, the technology is changing so incredibly.
But look, you know, we're going to deepen our partnership on offshore wind as well as climate overall, and create jobsgood jobs, union jobs.
And I apologize, I'm always talking about unions, but the reason I talk about it, not a joke, is because they have the single most qualified workers in the world. I mean, they're the best trained. Theyit's like going to college. You've got a 4-year apprenticeship. You know, you're getting paid a little bit when you're doing it, but it's a lot of work. And I just think it's reallyyou know, building trade jobs, steel jobs, manufacturing jobs. And you know, it's not just about the future, it's about right now.
This iswe'reI think we'rewe've gone beyondwe've been talking about this a long time. We talked about this a long time. And it's theand inthe last administration tried to block offshore wind because they thought it might cause cancer. Not a joke. But they actuallythat's what the last guy said. But it had nothing to do with that. What it had to do with is, they just didn't want to invest in alternative energy.
And I might addand I mean this sincerelyabout labor: Before Iwhen I was running, I made sure to go to all the major labor unions and tell them what my environmental plan was and why. And when I think ""climate,"" when I think ""environment,"" I think ""jobs."" Jobs. And thisthese are good-paying jobs, and they're making a big, big difference.
And my administration set bold targets to start with: 30 gigawatts by 2030. That's 10 million homes10 million homeswith offshore wind. Ports turned back into economic engines, being in a position where foundries and factories are up and runningagain, creating jobs. And a more resilient grid, harnessing technologies like battery storage.
And by the way, I know you all know it, but I'm not sure everybody in the country knows it: The technology is changing so rapidly on battery technology. It's just astounding what I predict you're going to see in the next 2 to 10 years, I mean, in terms of technological changes.
And this is a real boost for our energy security. It really changes the creation ofand jobs, and it cuts consumer cost. And we've approved more project, we've had record-setting lease sales, and we pushed the community investment project labor agreements and domestic inand the domestic supply chains in ways that hasn't occurred before.
We've shown that we're both open for business, and it's meant millions of privateit's meant billions in private capital, like companies that are here around this table as well. And that's meant States are doubling down, like the Governors in this room and on the screen. And together, you know, we're stepping up, like union workers are in this room as well.
And you know, I don't think we could have had this meeting 4 years agonot because of previousI mean, it's just so much has changed. There's business, labor, and Governors, all coming together in ways that we weren't before. And so I just think that it's meant workers and communities stepping up. And together, we're about to build a better America. I really mean that, an even better America.
And I just wanted to stop by and thank everybody. And I might note what one of my staff members said earlier, before Iwhen I was, earlier in the afternoon, talking about this. And that is that we're in a position where, you know, if you take ado you have thatwhere is the staff that has that printout of the size of thesewould you mind bringing that up to me?
This I show everybody I can, and you've all seen it. Youthis table knows. When we're talking about
[At this point, a White House aide handed a document to the President.]
This is the rendering of the Empire State Building. This is the Eiffel Tower. This is the average onshore turbine, 460 feet. This is the tallest onshore turbine, 540 feet. This is the new GE Haliade-X 835-foot offshore wind project on Block Island. Look how tall it is. Almost up to the[laughter]853 feet.
And there's a reason why this is important, as you all know, but I want the press to knowis that the wind that far out in the ocean is always blowing. It's not like it's just every once in a while, like you'd wait on shore, where we have to deal with battery storage, storing technology, et cetera. It's always blowing. And it can produce as much energy as a coal mine, as much energy as an oil, you know, wellwells. I mean, it's justand it's clean, and it's real, and it's continuous.
And so I just want to thank you all for all you're willing to do, and particularly the private companies who are stepping up here. And it's big time. We're stepping up, and we're talking billions of dollars. We're not just talking a little bit of money; we're talking billions of dollars. And I think we're going to get a lot done.
And I can't tell you the last time I've been this excited about something we're about to do, because I think we can changeliterally begin to change the nature of how we generate industryexcuse megenerate energy. And the industry is stepping up.
And by the way, I'm notI'm going to get going too much. [Laughter] Because I'm a little excited about it.
U.S. Supreme Court Decision in New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen 
Q. Mr. President, are you disappointed in the gun decision?
The President. Am I disappointed in thewell, I'll answer this one question. And I was just talking to the Governor of New York about this.
I am disappointed in the Supreme Court gun decision. There is one little bit of solace. And the minority making up the majority opinion has laid out that it affects not every State; it affects only 40 States. A lot of States it affects.
And the phrase that I found noticeable was: There's a difference between States that say ""may"" and theysay ""shall."" If you have to say you ""shall"" give, you ""shall"" do ABC, they're the ones that are going to have problems. But most say ""may."" I mean, ""may""I've got it reversed""may"" and ""shall.""
And so there arethe gun laws in 40 of these States are still in place based on the decision. Not good enough, but it'sI think it's a bad decision. I think it'sand I think it's not reasoned accurately. But I'm disappointed.
Q. Do you

2022-05-21 00:00:00,"Remarks Following a Meeting With President Yoon Suk Yeol of South Korea in Seoul, South Korea","
President Yoon. Mr. President, today, we're living in the era of economic security, where economy is security, and vice versa. The transformation of international trade order and disruption of global supply chains are having a direct impact on the livelihood of our people. The R.O.K.-U.S. alliance should also move forward and adapt to this new era of economic security.
Yesterday Mr. President and I, together, visited what can be described as the ""global epicenter"" of cutting-edge semiconductor industry. There I was able to feel the strength of our economic and technology alliance. We will continue our cooperation in strategic industries, such as microchips and EV batteries, in order to expand mutual investment and to attain our common goal, which is building a resilient supply chain.
And so, Mr. President, our summit talks today will provide a valuable opportunity to further strengthen our cooperation and economic security, as well as to discuss ways to work together and align our policies to resolve many of the pressing global challenges that we face together.
President Biden. Mr. President, thank you for your incredibly warm welcome. It's wonderful to be back in the Republic of Korea. I'm honored to be making this visit less than 2 weeks since you've been inaugurated. And congratulations.
Mr. President, our alliance isbetween our countrieshas built on shared sacrifice and our joint commitment to the freedom of the Republic of Korea and our firm opposition to changing borders by force. It has flourished with decades of peace and cooperation. And today, with this visit, we're taking the cooperation between our two countries to new heights.
For decades, our alliance has been a linchpin for regional peace and growth and prosperity, and it's been vital to deterring attacks from the D.P.R.K. And today, our cooperation is essential to preserve the stability and globalon the global stage as well.
Our two nations are working together to take on both the opportunities and the challenges of the moment: continuing to fight COVID-19, securing the supply chains, tackling the climate crisis, deepening our security cooperation to meet regional challenges, and writing the rules of the road to ensure the Indo-Pacific is a free and open area.
So thank you again for the welcome, Mr. President. I've enjoyed our conversations and getting to spend some time with you. Matter of a fact, we spent so much time, we didn't get a chance to see the rest of your people. [Laughter] And I'm looking forward to continuing the great friendship between our two nations.

2022-05-20 00:00:00,"Remarks Following a Tour of the Samsung Electronics Pyeongtaek Campus With President Yoon Suk Yeol of South Korea in Pyeongtaek, South Korea","
Mr. President, thank you. Thank you. You're very generous. Thank you very much. Mr. President, thank you for that introduction. It's wonderful to be back in the Republic of Korea.
President Yoon, I'm honored by the welcome you've given me to your beautiful country, and congratulations again on your electioncongratulationsand recent inauguration. I and my country look forward to a very productive few days together where we can get to know one another better and explore ways to take the alliance between the Republic of Korea and the United States to an even greater heights than it already exists.
And Vice Chairman Lee, thank you for welcoming us to this Samsung semiconductor facility. This is an auspicious start to my visit because it's emblematic of the future of cooperation and innovation that our nations can and must build together.
I'm joined by my Secretary of CommerceSecretary Raimondo is here in the front rowwho is working every day to bring us closer to that goal.
I've just seen how this plant makes the most advanced semiconductor chips in the world. They're a wonder of innovation and design, precision and manufacturing. Semiconductors power our economies and enable our modern lives, from our automobiles to our smartphones to medical diagnostic equipment.
And when it comes to the most advanced chips, like the ones made here at Samsungit's only one of only three companies in the world that makes these chips. It's an incrediblean incredible achievement. Because these little chips, only a few nanometers thick, are the key to propelling us into the next era of humanity's technological development: artificial intelligence, quantum technologies, 5G, and so very much more, things we haven't even thought of at this point.
This plant also reflects the close bonds in innovation between our countries. Much of the technology and machinery that is used to make these chips was designed and produced in the United States. And by uniting our skills and our technological know-how, it allows the production of chips that are critical to both our countries and are essentialessentialsectors of our global economy.
And thanks for the incredible $17 billion investment that Samsung announced last May, soon to the United Statesto have a facility like this one that manufactures the most advanced chips in the world in Tyler [Taylor],* Texas. Thank you.
This investment will create 3,000 new high-tech jobs in Texas and addto add to 20,000 jobs Samsung already supports in the United States of America. So I want to thank Samsung for their investment and for continuing to expand the very productive partnership between the Republic of Korea and the United States.
And I know that Samsung will also be working with Stellantis on a joint venture to build a new facility in the United States that will manufacture batteries for electric vehicles. Investments like these are going to help catapult us forward toward a clean energy future, which we both badly need, advancing our shared economic growth, our energy security, and our climate goals.
I also want to make clear that these are smart business decisions. Samsung investment ofdidn't invest $17 billion without, as we say in America, running the numbers. The United States is a top destination for foreign direct investment, like the one Samsung is making, because we have a world-class, highly skilled, and highly committed workers.
I urge Samsung and Stellantis and any company investing in the United States to enter into partnerships with our most highly skilled and dedicated and engaged workers you can find anywhere in the world: American union members. Stellantis knows how much benefit comes from a successful relationship with a union in America. They have a national agreement with my friend Ray Curry and the United Auto Workers. For every joint venture that manufactures electric vehicle batteries would be made stronger by collective bargaining relationships with America unions.
We also have outstanding, skilled, dedicated union building and construction trades workers ready to build the new Samsung facility in Texas. So let's work together to make this happen and to get that plant built on time and on budget safely and efficiently. Because union labor means high-quality work that delivers the best possible return on investment.
The United States has premier colleges and universities; a culture that fosters innovation and entrepreneurship; a transparent and predictable legal system, where companies know their ideas and their investments will be protected. And my administration is doubling down on all of these strengths.
We're investing more than $1 trillion to upgrade America's infrastructure coast to coast over the next decade. And hopefully soon, with the bipartisan innovation act, we will deliver historic Federal investments in U.S. research and development, including funding for something called the CHIPS Act to revitalize the U.S. semiconductor industry.
Our two nations work together to make the best, most advanced technology in the world. And this factory is proof of that. And that gives both the Republic of Korea and the United States a competitive edge in the global economy ififwe can keep our supply chains resilient, reliable, and secure.
Over the last few years, we've seen just how critical it is. COVID-19 pandemicthe COVID-19 pandemic exposed the fragility of ""just in time"" supply chains. A global semiconductor shortage has caused a shortfall in consumer goods, especially automobiles, and it's contributing to higher prices around the world.
And now, Putin's brutal and unprovoked war on Ukraine has further spotlighted the need to secure our critical supply chains so that our economyour economic and our national security are not dependent on countries that don't share our values.
A critical component of how we'll do that, in my view, is by working with close partners who do share our values, like the Republic of Korea, to secure more of what we need from our allies and partners and bolster our supply chain resilience. That's why our strategy is to build around strengthening our ties and cooperation across the board. That's how both our nations can improve our long-term resilience, increase our shared prosperity, and put our people in the best position to come out ahead in the competition for the 21st century.
And that's why, Mr. President, I came to the Republic in [of]* Korea on my first trip to Asia as President of the United States. So muchso much of the future of the world is going to be written here in the Indo-Pacific over the next several decades.
We're standing at an inflection point in history where the decisions we make today will have far-reaching impacts on the world we leave to our children tomorrow.
This vibrant democracy has become a powerhouse of global innovation by investing in educating its people. And companies like Samsung that are driven by a responsible development of technology and innovation will be critical to shaping the future and the direction of our two countriesthe direction we both want to go.
So this is the moment, in my view, to invest in one another, to deepen our business ties, to bring our people even closer together.
This is something President Yoon and I will be talking about on our visit later thisafter this meeting and in the months ahead. Because the alliance between the Republic of Korea and the United States of America is a linchpin of peace, stability, and prosperity for the region and the world that we seek.
So thank you all very much and, President MoonYoon, thank you for everything you've done so far. Appreciate it. Thank you.

2022-05-19 00:00:00,Remarks Following a Meeting With President Sauli Niinist of Finland and Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson of Sweden,"
President Biden. Please, please, be seated. Thank you.
It's not only a beautiful day, this is, in my view and the view of my team, a momentous day. It's a very, very good day.
Today I am proud to welcome and offer the strong support of the United States for the applications of two great democracies and two close, highly capable partners to join the strongest, most powerful defensive alliance in the history of the world; two proud, independent countries exercising their sovereign right all states possess to decide their own security. President Niinist, you areand Prime Minister Andersson: You'reit's a great honor to have both of you here at the White House as Finland and Sweden begin the process of joining NATO.
It was out of the wreckage of World War II that NATO was formed. And in the seven decades that followed, NATO has proved itself an indispensable alliance committed to a Europe whole, free, and at peace. But in recent years, doubts began to arise. Was NATO still relevant? Was it still effective? Is it still needed in the 21st-century world?
Today, there is no question: NATO is relevant, it is effective, and it is more needed now than ever. The indispensable alliance of decades past is still the indispensable alliance for the world we face today and, I would argue, tomorrow as well. And the decision of Sweden and Finland, the one they have made, is testament to that commitment. This is about the future. It's about a revived NATO that has the tools and resources, the clarity and conviction to defend our shared values and lead the world.
Sweden and Finland are already among our closest partners on a range of issues, from strengthening peace and stability to advancing human rights, to taking on climatethe climate crisis and addressing food insecurity, from strengthening the global health to promoting development.
Finnish and Swedish troopsFinnish and Swedish troopshave already served shoulder to shoulder with U.S. and NATO forces in Kosovo, in Afghanistan, and in Iraq. And both Finland and Sweden are already working in coordination with the United States and our other allies and partners to support the brave people of Ukraine as they defend their freedom against Russia's invasion.
Sweden and Finland have strong democratic institutions, strong militaries, and strong and transparent economies, and a strong moral sense of what is right. They meet every NATO requirement, and then some. And having two new NATO members in the high north will enhance the security of our alliance and deepen our security cooperation across the board.
Today the President, the Prime Minister, and I had a very good discussion about NATO accession, about the war in Ukraine, and strengthening transatlantic security. But our conversations began well before today.
President Niinist and I spoke last December and again in January in the weeks leading up to Russia's unjust and unprovoked assault on Ukraine. In March, the President came to the White Housecame to the White Houseto see me, to discuss this brutal conflict and the rupture it's causing in Europe.
While we were in the Oval Office together, we picked up the phone and we called the Prime Minister. And the three of us all spoke, and we spoke again last week when I invited them to come to the White House today.
We have consulted closely at every stage as Sweden and Finland made their determinations. And today I'm proud to assure them that they have the full, total, complete backing of the United States of America.
Today my administration is submitting to the United States Congress reports on NATO accession for both countries so the Senate can efficiently and quickly move on advising and consenting to the treaty. I greatly appreciate Senator Schumer and McConnell's support, as well as Senator Menendez and Risch, to move this through the Senate as quickly as possible once the perspective of all allies are addressed and NATO adopts the accession protocols.
The bottom line is simple, quite straightforward: Finland and Sweden make NATO stronger, not just because of their capacity, but because they're strong, strong democracies. And a strong, united NATO is the foundation of America's security.
By joining NATO, allies make a sacred commitment to one another that an attack on one is an attack against all. It's article 5 of the Washington Treaty and the core building block of our alliance. And the only time in history article 5 has been invoked was after 9/11, when the United States was attacked and all our allies rallied to our side.
The United States will never forget that. And we will never fail in our pledge to defend every single inch of NATO territory. I welcome Sweden and Finland choosing that responsibility as well. This is going to benefit all of our people.
And today the President, Prime Minister, and I committed that we're going to work together to remain vigilant against the threats to our shared security and deter and confront any aggression while Finland and Sweden are in this accession process. ""There's nothing going to be missed,"" as my mother would say, ""between the cup and lip."" We're in, once it is moving forward. I really mean it. And I really mean it.
So let me be clear: New members joining NATO is not a threat to any nation. It never has been. NATO's purpose is to defend against aggression. That's its purpose: to defend. And let makelet me makelet no one make a mistake the meaning of this historic day. In the face of aggression, NATO has not grown weaker or more divided; it has grown stronger, more united.
With Finland and Sweden's decision to request membership in NATO, it will be enhanced for all time. Standing together today, we reject the bloody creed that ""might makes right,"" and we declare a more powerful creed: ""All for one, and one for all."" Because what makes NATO strong isn't just our enormous military capacity, but our commitment to each other, to its values.
NATO is an alliance of choice, not coercion. This is a victory for democracy in action. Finland and Sweden are seeking to join NATO because their citizens demanded it, and their elected leaders heard them. That's how it works when leaders derive their power from the consent of the governmentfrom consent of the governed.
And that's why NATO's open door has always been so important. It allows nations to choose for themselves to ask to be part of a group of nations that value freedom, democracy, and human dignity above all else. Countries must demonstrate that they meet NATO's high standards for military interoperability, economic transparency, and democratic accountability.
That's what Sweden and Finland have done. And so today it's an affirmation of those countries in Europe that share our values that we're willing and able to do what it takes to be part of the alliance. NATO's door remains open.
In just a few minutes, I'll be leaving to spend time with two of our Indo-Pacific allies. In a half-hour or so, I'll be flying to the Republic of Korea and Japan. I thank the President and the Prime Minister for traveling here on this meetingfor this meeting before I take off because it is so important.
America's alliances in Europe and in Asia keep usand, I would argue, the worldstrong and secure. They're how we confront the challenges of our time and deliverdeliver for our people today, and harnessharness opportunities for a better tomorrow. And I look forward soon calling Sweden and Finland our friends, partners, and NATO allies.
I want to thank you both for being here, and I'm going to invite each of you to say a few words. And we'll startMr. President, the podium is yours.
President Niinist. Mr. President, thank you so very much.
President Biden. Thank you.
President Niinist. Thank you.
Mr. President, it is with great pleasure and honor to be standing here today with you, together with the Swedish Prime Minister, Magdalena Andersson.
We are here for a very good reason. Together, we are taking a historic step by seeking to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Finland has made its decision after a rapid, but a very thorough process. The process has once again revealed the strength of Finnish democracy. Starting from the strong public support, the decision was made with an overwhelming parliamentary majority. And it also enjoys huge, strong popular support.
I want to thank you, Mr. President, for your steadfast support throughout this process. In early March, I visited White House, and you encouraged us to go further. That was of vital importance to our process. Your statement yesterday and our trilateral meeting today are a testimony of enduring commitment the United States has made to European and transatlantic security.
I want to assure that Finland will become a strong NATO ally. We take our security very seriously. The Finnish Armed Forces are one of the strongest in Europe. We have also consistently invested in developing our capabilities.
The Finns' willingness to defend their country is one of the highest in the whole world. We are ready to contribute to the security of the whole alliance, making the commitment to mutual security guarantees that being a NATO ally entails.
Now that we have taken this first decisive step, it is time for NATO allies to weigh in. We hope for strong support from all allies and for a swift ratification of our membership once it's agreed. I believe that the United States can set a crucially important example to others.
The Turkish leadership has recently expressed concerns about our membership application. I want to address these concerns today. Finland has always had proud and good bilateral relations to Turkey. As NATO allies, we will commit to Turkey's security, just as Turkey will commit to our security.
We take terrorism seriously. We condemn terrorism in all its forms, and we are actively engaged in combating it. We are open to discussing all the concerns Turkey may have concerning our membership in an open and constructive manner. These discussions have already taken place, and they will continue in the next days.
Twenty-fourth February, I said that the masks have fallen, and we see only the cold faces of war. Russia's war in Ukraine has changed Europe and our security environment. Finland takes the step of NATO membership in order to strengthen not only its own security, but also in order to strengthen wider transatlantic security.
This is not away from anybody. Like you, Mr. President, said, NATO is protective, defensive, not a threat to anybody. At the same time, we must not forget that at this very moment, the brave people of Ukraine are fighting not only for their own freedom and democracy, but for our common security. Finland, together with the EU and the United States, stands firmly behind Ukraine.
So, Mr. President, once again, I want to thank you for making history with us. Thank you.
President Biden. Thank you. Prime Minister.
Prime Minister Andersson. Mr. President, thank you for welcoming President Niinist and me to the White House.
The bonds between Sweden and the United States, they are strong and longstanding. And as you know, Swedes first set foot in your home State of Delaware in 1638. [Laughter] And we were one of the first countries to recognize United States as an independent nation in 1783.
And since then, our countries have developed a deep and longstanding friendship through family ties, trade, and mutual interests. And I personally is very much one part of this. But most of all, our shared values and beliefs in democracy and freedom, values and beliefs that are now being put to the test.
And today, the situation in Ukraine reminds us of the darkest days of European history. And I must say that, during dark times, it is great to be among close friends. And over these past months, we have shown transatlantic unity and strength at its best. Together, we have responded forcefully to Russia's aggression and provided unprecedented support to Ukraine. We have not flinched.
And, Mr. President, I want to thank you for the massive U.S. support to Ukraine and for your sustained engagements in European society.
President Niinist and I have come here at a historic moment for our countries. And for Sweden, after 200 years of military nonalignment, Sweden has chosen a new path. Yesterday Sweden and Finland submitted our formal requests to join NATO.
And Russia's full-scale aggression against a sovereign and democratic neighbor, that was a watershed moment for Sweden. And my government has come to the conclusion that the security of the Swedish people will be best protected within the NATO alliance. And this is backed by very broad support in the Swedish Parliament.
And with Sweden and Finland as members, NATO will also be stronger. We are security providers with sophisticated defense capabilities. And we are champions of freedom, democracy, and human rights.
We have a long tradition of extensive military cooperation with NATO, including all missions. And we are right now ramping up our defense spending, and we will reach 2 percent of GDP as soon as practically possible.
And, Mr. President, your support for our country's NATO aspirations for our security are of fundamental importance. And we look forward to a swift ratification process by NATO members. And we are right now having a dialogue with all NATO member countries, including Turkey, on different levels to sort out any issues at hand.
In the United States, the Senate is crucial in this regard. And last SaturdaySunday, I hosted a delegation headed by Senate Republican Leader McConnell in Sweden. And later today, President Niinist and I will meet Senate Majority Leader Schumer and other leading Members of Congress. And we greatly appreciate the broad and strong support expressed by both parties in Congress.
But, Mr. President, our countries also work closer together when tackling global challenges. And Sweden, like other Nordic countries, has shown that emissions reductions can go hand in hand with economic growth. And in Sweden right now, the green transition creates thousands of jobs through investments in battery factories, green mining, and fossil-free steel production. And I actually brought the President a unique example of this: a candleholder made of the world's first fossil-free steel. [Applause]
President Biden. It's important.
Prime Minister Andersson. And what we see in Sweden right now is that previously neglected areas are no longer struggling with unemployment or depopulation, but how to build housing, infrastructure, and schools quick enough to meet up with the expansion.
And here, I see fantastic opportunities to cooperate between the Nordic countries and United States. And I'm also proud that Sweden contributes to the U.S. economy and the prosperity of the American people. Swedish companies are active in every single State, creating more than 350,000 jobs in the United States. And we are the 15th largest investor.
Mr. President, I want to thank you for your leadership in our joint efforts to promote democracy throughout the world. Because democracy requires constant work and safeguarding, we have to win every new generation.
And let me conclude where I started: Peace and stability in our part of the world is a common security interest for us, for you, and for the rest of Europe. And we stand here today more united than ever, and we are committed to strengthening our bonds even further. And Sweden is prepared to shoulder its responsibility as an ally in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
Thank you.
President Biden. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

The President. Thank you. Please sit down. Well, folks, first of all, concluding this tour with Admiral Linda Fagan, Vice Commander of Coast Guardsoon to be the Commander of the Coast Guard; and Administrator Spinrad of NOAA, it really is amazing what you all do to protect us, and it's astounding. I still marvel at the idea that somebody jumps out of a perfectly good helicopter in the middle of the ocean to save people. [Laughter] But it really is amazing what you all do.
You know, I met with some of these brave women and men who perform these high-risk missionsand they aretrying to help not only deal with, but predict the hurricanesthe severity of them, where they're going to land, and flying right into the heart of them.
Iincluding the dedicated personnel from the Air Force, NOAA, the Coast Guard, who help warn about hurricanes that are forming and predict their strength, what they're likely to be, and keep Americans safe.
But it's not going tothis job is not going to slow up anytime soon. It's likely to getI'm here to get a read on what's going to happen, what the hurricane season this year is going to look like. But we're prepared for the upcoming hurricane season.
My message to all Americans is straightforward: We know hurricanes are coming our way. They grow more extreme every season thus far. Pay attention to the hurricane warnings. Andand, andfollowfollowthe guidance of your local authorities.
While you do everything you can to protect yourself and your families, I promise you weall of us hereare going to do everything we can to protect you. Our top priority is to help Americans prevent, prepare, and respond in every community to what we're going towhat's going to happen.
And ouryou know, one of our charges andiswell, put it another way, one the changes I directed is thatto ensure that the piles of paperwork and the bureaucratic excuseexcuses we'vebeen used in the past sometimes don't stand in the way of getting to help the most disadvantaged communities as fast as possible.
And I know it's not preventing, but in the aftermath, you know, you've done an incredible job. You've done an incredible job of making sure we're not leaving anybody behind. Thank you. And Iunfortunately, I've visited too many devastated areas with youhurricanes, tornadoes, floods, et cetera. You do an incredible job.
And that's why HUD and Marcia Fudge, Secretary of HUD; and the SBA Administrator Isabel Guzman isbriefed me today, along with FEMA andAdministrator Criswell.
In 2021, it was the third most active hurricane season ever recorded, including the first hurricane to hit the Northeast in 30 years, killing more than 100 people and causing billionsbillionsof dollars in damage. And given the climate crisis, it's likely towe expect another tough hurricane season. And storms are going to be more intense, and we're going to have shorter notice, as we saw last year with Hurricane Ida.
That's why the work of these women and men is so important. And we're going to continue to ensure hurricane hunters and their partners have what they need to get their job done.
It's aboutthis isn't about red States and blue States; it's about helping communities prepare, having their back when the hurricane strikes, and being there to help, being thethere to help clear the roads, rebuild the Main Streets so families can get back to their lives.
And so we don't have a moment to lose. But I want to thank the leaders and the personnel assembled here for all the work you do, and I mean that sincerely. And I look forward to hearing from you.
And I've had the opportunity to, with notable exceptionI can only think of onevisit every serious area that has been affected by fires, hurricanes, tornadoes. You know, as I was talking to Deanne, our Administrator, yesterday, you know, we've lost more territory burned to the ground because of firesforest firesthan the entire State of New Jersey, from the New York border all the way down to the end of New Jersey; more has been lost. It's an enormous amount of damage. And the firefighters are risking their lives and losing them sometimes.
So I wish everybodyI think they do know, but I wish they knew how serious, how prepared, and how much risk all of your folks take in order to get things done.
So thank you, thank you, thank you. And I'm ready to be briefed on all you have to tell me. And I'm sure you're going to tell me, ""No hurricanes this year."" [Laughter] But
Finland/Sweden 
Q. Mr. President, how will you convince Turkey to support Sweden and Finland's NATO bid?
The President. I'm going to say one thing. I'm going to beI got a call months ago from the President of Finland, wanted to come and see me. I saw him. He told me what he was thinking about. And then I got a call that both the leader of Finland and Sweden are coming to see me on Thursday. I think we're going to be okay.
Q. You can convince Turkey to accept their bid?
The President. I thinkI'm not going to Turkey, but I think we're going to be okay.
Thank you.

2022-05-17 00:00:00,"Remarks at an Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander Heritage Month Reception","
Vice President Kamala D. Harris. Thank you, Ambassador Tai. It is true, there is something we all know: that we must always honor the mothers, the aunties, the chithis, all of them. [Laughter] And of course, the husbands and the fathers and the grandfathers. [Laughter]
It is good to be with everyone. I think this is, Mr. President, one of the biggest groups that we've had since we've been in office, and it's quite a beautiful sight to see. So good afternoon to everyone. [Applause] Good afternoon.
And as you all know, my mother arrived in the United States at the age of 19, from India. And when I think about the work that we are all doing, the work we are doing as an administration, led by our President, in terms of not only living the values but standing on the shoulders of so many who imagined that we would all be here and who know that when we talk about the beauty of who we are as a nation, as the United States of America, it is represented by all of the people who are here today and all those who are proud that we stand here today together.
President Joe Biden, Dr. Jill Biden, Mr. Second Gentleman[laughter]and members of our Cabinet, it is good again to be gathered with all of you today and to be joined by the members of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus.
As a former member of the caucus, I will take a few moments to talk about a friend to so many of us, a mentor to so many of us, one who helped found CAPAC and became its first chair. And of course, I am talking about the amazing Secretary Norman Mineta, who devoted his career to public service.
For all of those who knew Norm, he worked tirelessly to make our Nation stronger, safer, and more just. And in so doing, he inspired a generation of leaders, including me. Secretary Mineta's family is here with us today. And from my family to yours, please know that he is deeply missed.
Today, yes, it is a great celebration for so many reasons of so many things. But it is also impossible to ignore that we gather mere days after a horrific act of hate in Buffalo, New York, targeting Black Americans.
And you know, it was only last year, as the Ambassador saidonly last year that wethat I was with the President in Atlanta, mourning the murder of eight people, including six who were Asian American women. And sadly, what I said then remains true now: Racism is real in America. It has always been. Xenophobia is real in America. It has always been. Sexism too.
I said last year and I sadly say again today: We have had people in positions of incredible power in our country scapegoating, people with the biggest pulpits spreading this kind of hate. This requiresthese moments, sadly, tragically, requireus to ask: ""Who are we as a nation? And what do we stand for?""
It is yet again a moment to remember and talk about and reflect on how we treat people and do we live to the greatest and best of our ideals, which means treating peopleall peoplewith dignity and respect, remembering the history of our Nation and who built our Nation and honoring the diversity of all who have contributed to who we are today.
And of course, that is what this month requires us to do. And I know, looking around at the leaders here, we remember it every day of the year. And we also know in tragic moments like this that we are committed collectively to saying: A harm against any one of us is a harm against all of us, and it is all harm against our Nation.
And the President and I, and all of us as leaders, will not be silent. We will not stand by. We must always speak out against violence, against hate crime and discrimination, whenever and wherever it occurs. And we must do everything in our power to end this epidemic of hate.
We feel great pride, based on good reason and fact and history, in what we celebrate today. And we know that those who allowed us to be here, and paved the path for us to be present at this moment, expect great things from us, including that we are not only clear eyed, but that we are optimistic about our futurecollectively about our future as a nation; that we remain committed to the ideals that make this Nation great; that we remain committed to the notion that a harm against any one of us is a harm against all of us.
But that is an extension of a most profound belief, which is that we are in this together as one Nation undivided. So today we celebrate all those ideals when we celebrate the great people of this Nation who have paved a path for so many of us to be where we are today.
And finally, to quote, then, a great American, Norm MinetaI quote: ""If we will act together, then we are strong enough to withstand any evil, internal or external, that threatens to unravel""and this is key""this beautiful tapestry that is America.""
And now it is my great honor to introduce a man who ran for President because he knows that no one should be in this fight alone, President Joe Biden.
The President. You've got to admit, I have got good taste in picking people, don't you? [Laughter] Way above my pay grade.
Kamala, thank you, and Ambassador Tai; and Doug, the Second Gentleman, out there hiding behind everybody out there, I know. [Laughter].
And you know, Jill and I are honored to welcome all of you here to celebrate the Asian American, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander Heritage Month here in the Rose Garden.
You know, it's wonderful to see so many friends: U.S. Senator Mazie Hirono. Wherewhere's Mazie? I seewas told she's here. I'm looking. Mazie, wherever you are, you're the best.
And Tammy Duckworth. TammyTammy is here, I'm told. Orgoing to be here. No? At any rateand the chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, Representative Judy Chu, is here as well. And there's several other representatives here today who represent the community in Congress that is growing each election.
As Katherine mentioned, I'm proud to have reestablished the White House Initiative on Asian American, Native AmericanNative Hawaiian, and Pacific Islanders. Several members are here today along with members of the community across the administration at every level.
Also joining are mayors and local leaders and leaders of business and philanthropy, leaders of civil rights, the arts, the fashions and culture.
And this is a reception that follows on thethe great honor Jill and I, Kamala and Doug had in hosting Team U.S.A., including the Americanthe Asian American athletes who so honorably represented America in the Olympics.
Not too long ago, that included one of the most decoratedthe most decorated figure skater in U.S. historyand also worked on my campaignalso worked on my campaign and is now my nominee to be Ambassador to Belize: Michelle Kwan. Michelle, you're the best, kid. You're the best. You do things backward better than most people can do them forward. [Laughter]
And you represent a simple truth: There is no single Asianas Jill pointed out much more articulately than I havethere is no single Asian American, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander identity. It doesn't exist. The diversity of cultures, the breadth and achievement that has shaded and shaped so many, strengthened the fabric of this country in ways that you can't measure. I don't thinkI don't know how you can measure it.
The fastest growing demographic in the United States that has also gotten us through the pandemic as frontline and essential workers. And you've powered our economic recovery: An unemployment rate in a community that's fallen from 6.6 percent since we got in office to 3.1 percentfor Asian Americans. Entrepreneurship in the community has risenwith you all, it's risen the fastest rate in over a decade. Where members of the community were once tokenized as villains on the movie screens, you now light them up as superheroes.
And today I'll be travelingon Thursday, excuse me, I'll be traveling to the Republic of Korea and Japan to affirm the importance of our Indo-Pacific alliances. Folksand to celebrate the indispensable partnerships that are strengthening by the deep family ties and heritage and the values reflected in the AANNHPIaye, aye, aye, aye, aye[laughter]community here in the United States. As they say in Claymont, Delaware, ""All yous guys."" [Laughter]
But look, we know that for the generations of progress, racism, harassment, and hate crimes persist, as was pointed out by my friends behind me. And today we know that maybe you are one of them who don't feel safe walking American streets.
A shooting near Atlanta a year ago is still fresh, as been mentioned, in the hearts of so many. And Kamala and I went to visitdown to visit. Just as we've seen hate crime shootings in Orange County, California; Dallas, Texas, just last week. Jill and I just got back from BuffaloBuffalo, New Yorkwhere another lone gunman with a hate-filled soul shot and killed Black people at a grocery store on a Saturday afternoon.
You know, I probably shouldn't be saying this now, but I'm going to say it anyway: We have to not only talk about how we're going to end the hate, but who's responsible for generating it. Who is responsible for generating it.
Look, I've said many times: Hate can have no safe harbor in America. And every person deserves to be treated with dignity and respect. But you know, you have folks on television stations talking about the ""replacement theory,"" scaring the living hell out of people who don't have a whole lot of emotional stability, taking advantage ofon the internet and other means by talking about how we're going to be ""overtaken.""
That's why, 1 year ago, with the help of many of you, I signed into law the bipartisan COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act. And with your continued help[applause]no, with your continued helpour commitment to advance equality across the board in everything from health care, to education, to housing, to LGBTQ rights.
Look, we're working to fix our immigration system to reflect our values and the truth that legal immigration defines who we are as a nationwho we are as a nation. That's why we're so darn strong.
Bottom line is, we're doing the work to make real the promise of America for every American, a promise that holds that every person is created equal and deserves to be treated equally throughout their lives.
We've never fully lived up to that promise, but we've never, ever before walked away from it. We've never walked away from it. And that's what we acknowledge during this month: building a legacy of strength and resilience for people like you and almost all of our forebears.
You know, you were telling the storyJill is going to get mad at me forit reminded me. I happen to be Irish. [Laughter] That's the problem sometimes with Jill. But anyway, I'm only joking.
The First Lady. That's not true. [Laughter]
The President. No, I'm teasing. But my mother used to always say on birthdays, ""The mother should get the gift, not the child."" So I didn't realize it was both Asian and Irish, but[laughter]at least in my house.
And speaking of friends, the late Norm Mineta, whom Kamala just spoke about, was one of my close friends, for real. As you all know, Norm was born in 1931 in San Jose, California, an immigrantto immigrant parents from Japan. As an 11-year-old, he spent 3 years in an incarceration camp, among 120,000 Japanese Americans across the country. But with every reason to be angry and resentfulevery reason to be angry and resentfulNorm chose to believe in himself, to believe in America, and to believe in his country.
He served in the United States Army, elected the first Asian American mayor of a major city in his hometown, San Jose. Elected and served two decades as a Congressman. We werewe spent a lot of time together and traveled together, serving with pioneers and dear friends like Danny Inouye and Danny Akaka. They both taught me, by the way, not only about Asian Americans, they taught me that it is ""Native Americans,"" not ""Indian Tribes."" ""Native Americans.""
And Danny was the first guyI don't want to ruin his reputation, God bless his soulbut Danny was the first guy to convince me to run for President and be my national campaign chairman.
Then Norm became the first American of Asian descent to serve as a Cabinet Secretary. Norm passed away earlier this month, as we all know. Days after, I signed a bill into law naming the U.S. Department of Transportation headquarters in his honor. Today we're honored to be joined by two of his sons, David and Bob. Where are you guys? Come up here.
You're a good manyou're both good men. Thank you very, very much. And I want to tell you, he was one of hell of a man. So let's all follow in the power of Norm's example.
I thank you all for being here, and I want you to enjoy the rest of the reception. Remember, though: This fight that we'refor equality, we're just starting here. It's not just the wackos who go out there with those guns and get talked into doing something, it's the people who fill their brains with false ideas. It's the people who make themconvince them, for their power and their prestige and their moneyto be able to go out and do these terrible things.
That's not who we are. That's not who we are. And I'll be darned, as long as I'm President of the United States, I'm going to fight like hell, and we're going to expose everybody. We've got to make sure that thisand myyou know, there's athere's a hymn in mybased on the 91st Psalm, and it saysin my church""May He raise you up on eagle's wings and bear you on the breath of dawn, and let the sun shine upon you until""and then he goes on to talk about that we allallthat God will hold you in the palm of his hand.
That's how we've got to think about our fellow Americans. The reason we are strong, the reason we're who we are is because we're diverse, with so many talents. So many.
I know this group will never forget it. But I'm going to spend the rest of my term and as long I'm in office reminding the rest of America they should understand it too.
God bless you all, and enjoy the night, today. And thank you for being here.

The President's Remarks Honoring the Victims of the Shooting in Buffalo, New York 
Q. Mr. President, what was your message to the families? What was your message to the families?
The President. What was the question?
Q. Mr. President, do you
Q. What was your message to the families, Mr. President?
The President. My message was, they're going to be in pain for a long while. But they will get to the point where somethingthey'll open a closet door, or they'll ride by a park, or they'll eat their favorite ice cream, and they'll think of the person they lost, and they'll smile before they cry. And that's when they know you're going to make it. Until then, you're not sure. But it will happen. It will come.
Q. Mr. President
""Replacement Theory"" 
Q. Mr. President, do you believe that certain Members of Congress, the Republican Party, as well as Tucker Carlson, who have echoed the ""replacement theory,"" deserve some blame for violent acts like this?
The President. I believe anybody who echoes a replacement is to blamenot for this particular crime. But it's if for no purposeno purposeexcept for profit and/or political benefit. And it's wrong. It's just simply wrong.
Gun Control Measures 
Q. What more can you do on guns via executive action?
The President. Not much on executive action. I've got to convince the Congress that we should go back to what I passed years ago.
I mean who in God's
Q. How are you doing that?
The President. Well, I'm going to try. I'm going to try.
Gun Control Measures 
Q. What's yourwhat is your thoughts about next steps in Congress? Do you think there's an opportunity or a prospect for more movement there?
The President. The answer is, it's going to be very difficult. It's going to be very difficult. But I'm not going to give up trying.
Domestic Terrorism 
Q. Mr. President, is it time for a domestic terrorism statute?
The President. Well, we have enough laws on the books to deal with what's going on now. But we just have towe have to deal with it.
Look, part of what the country has to do is look in the mirror and face the reality. We have a problem with domestic terror. It's real.
I know you don't want to hear menot you. People don't want to hear me saying it. They say: ""Well, he's the President. He's a Democrat. He's""but that's what the intelligence community has been saying; that's what the military has been saying for a long time. There's nothing we can do about this. Nothing to do about this.
And look, there is a lot of people, like this murderer who committed this act, who are just deranged, who are susceptible, who are just lost and don't know what to do, and they're easily taken; they're easily sucked in. And it's got to stop. We have to admit it. I don't know why we don't admit what the hell is going on.
Anyway, thank you very much. We'll get on the plane.

2022-05-17 00:00:00,"Remarks Honoring the Victims of the Shooting at the Tops Friendly Markets Grocery Store and Condemning White Supremacy in Buffalo, New York","
The President. Before I begin, IJill would like to say a few words.
The First Lady. I just wanted to say thank you to the families for opening up your hearts to us and for letting us be with you today. So God bless you, and thank you for allowing us to be with you. Joe.
The President. To Majority Leader Schumer and Senator Gillibrand and Congressman Higgins.
And, Gov, thank you for taking my call when I called. And I'll never forget what she said. I said, ""I'd like to maybe come up if it's okay."" She said: ""This is a big Scranton. Come. Come."" And I think you're doing a heck of a job. Thank you. Thank you for your heart as well as your head.
And, Mayor Brown, you've been ayou've been wonderful. Thank you. And I know this is a lot ofwhen a Vice Presidential or a Presidential trip shows up, it'sthere's all kinds of paraphernalia and people, and I know it's not easy. I want to thank your law enforcement officers for not just what they did in this crisis, but for accommodating us.
And all the elected officials, and law enforcement officers, first responders, and faith leaders that are here today: Jill and I have come to stand with you.
And to the families: We've come here to grieve with you. It's not the same, but we know a little bit of what's like to lose a piece of your soul when you lose a son, a daughter, a husband, a wife, a mother, a father. The feeling of having thatas I said to some of you when we talked privately: You feel like there's a black hole in your chest you're being sucked into and you're suffocating, unable to breathe. That's what it felt like, at least to us. And I'm sure some version of thatit feels that way to you. The anger. The pain. The depth of a loss that's so profound.
You know, we know it's hard to believe, and you're probably not going to believe it, but I can tell you now from our personal experience and many others who we've met: The day is going to comeit will comewhen your loved one brings a smile as you remember him or heras you remember her; it's going to bring a smile to your lip before it brings a tear to your eye. It takes a while for that to happen. It takes a while. It might take more than a season, but our prayer for you is that time comes sooner or later, but I promise you it will come.
As a nation, I say to the families: We remember them. We've been reading about them. We visited the memorial wherethe show of the love for them, and you've all shown, by the supermarket.
And Celestine Chaney, 65 years old. Brain cancer survivor, churchgoer, bingo player. Went to buy strawberries to make her favorite shortcake. A loving mother and a grandmother.
Roberta Drury, 32. Beloved daughter and sister. Moved back home to help take care of her brother after his bone marrow transplant. She went to buy groceries for dinner. The center of attention who made everyone in the room laugh and smile when she walked in.
Andre Mackneilexcuse me, Andre Mackneil, 53. Worked at a restaurant. Went to buy his 3-year-old son a birthday cake. His son selling [celebrating]* a birthday, asking, ""Where is Daddy?""
Katherine Massey, 72. A writer and an advocate who dressed up in costumes at schools and cut the grass in the park and helped in local elections. The glue of the family and the community.
Margus Morrison, 52. Schoolbus aide. Went to buy snacks for weekly movie night with the family. Survived by his wife and three children and his stepdaughter. The center of their world.
Heyward Patterson, 67. Father, church deacon. Fed the homeless at the soup kitchen. Gave rides to the grocery store to neighbors who needed help. Putting food in the trunk of others when he took his final breath.
Aaron Salter, 55. Retired Buffalo police officer for three decades. Three decades. Loved electric cars. A hero who gave his life to save others on a Saturday afternoon. And had that man not been wearing that vest that he purchasedbulletproof vesta lot of lives would have been saved. A beloved father and husband.
Geraldine Talley, 62. Expert banker [baker].* And known for her warm, gentle personality. A friend to everybody. Devoted mother and grandmother.
Ruth Whitfield, 88. Beloved wife, mother, grandmother, great-grandmother who sang in the church choir. A caretaker of her husband, bringing him clean clothes, cutting his hair, holding his hand every day she visited him in the nursing home. Heart as big as her head.
Pearl Young, 77. A mother, grandmother, missionary of God. Public school teacher who also ran a local food pantry. Loved singing, dancing, and her family.
And all three are injured: Zaire Goodman, 20. Shot in the neck but fighting through it. Jennifer Warrington, 50. Christopher Braden, 55. Both treated with injuries, on a long road to recovery.
Individual lives of love, service, and community that speaks to the bigger story of who we are as Americans. A great nation because we're a good people.
Jill and I bring you this message from deep in our Nation's soul: In America, evil will not win, I promise you. Hate will not prevail. And White supremacy will not have the last word.
For the evil did come to Buffalo, and it's come to all too many places, manifested in gunmen who massacred innocent people in the name of hateful and perverse ideology rooted in fear and racism.
It's taken so much. Ten lives cut short in a grocery store, three other woundedthree other wounded by a hate-filled individual who had driven 200 miles from Binghamtonin that rangeto carry out a murderous, racist rampage that he would livestreamlivestreamto the world.
What happened here is simple and straightforward: terrorism. Terrorism. Domestic terrorism. Violence inflicted in the service of hate and the vicious thirst for power that defines one group of people being inherently inferior to any other group.
A hate that through the media and politics, the internet, has radicalized angry, alienated, lost, and isolated individuals into falsely believing that they will be replacedthat's the word, ""replaced""by the ""other,"" by people who don't look like them and who are therefore, in a perverse ideology that they possess and being fed, lesser beings.
I, and all of you, reject the lie. I call on all Americans to reject the lie. And I condemn those who spread the lie for power, political gain, and for profit. Because that's what it is. We have now seen too many times the deadly and destructive violence this ideology unleashes. We heard the chants, ""You will not replace us,"" in Charlottesville, Virginia.
I wasn't going to run, as the Senator knows, again for President. But when I saw those people coming out of the woodsof the fields ofin Virginia, in Charlottesville, carrying torches, shouting ""You will not replace us,"" accompanied by White supremacists and carrying Nazi banners, that's when I said, ""No."" ""No.""
And I, honest to Godthose who know meChuckyou know I wasn't going to run for certain. But I was going to be darned if I was going to letanyway. Don't want to get going. [Laughter]
Look, we've seen the mass shootings in Charleston, South Carolina; El Paso, Texas; in Pittsburgh; last year in Atlanta; this week in Dallas, Texas; and now in Buffaloin Buffalo, New York.
White supremacy is a poison. It's a poison[applause]running throughit really isrunning through our body politic. And it's been allowed to fester and grow right in front of our eyes. No more. I mean, no more. We need to say as clearly and forcefully as we can that the ideology of White supremacy has no place in America. None.
And look, failure for us to not say thatfailure in saying that is going to be complicity. Silence is complicity. It's complicity. We cannot remain silent.
Our Nation's strength has always come from the ideait's going to sound corny, but think about it: What's the idea of our Nation? That we're all children of God. All childrenlife, liberty, are universal goods, gifts of God. We didn't get it from the government, we got it frombecause we exist, and we're called upon to defend them.
The venom of the haters and their weapons of war, the violence in the words and deeds thatthat stalk our streets, our stores, our schoolsthis venom, this violence cannot be the story of our time. We cannot allow that to happen.
Look, I'm not nave. I know tragedy will come again. It cannot be forever overcome. It cannot be fully understood either. But there are certain things we can do. We can keep assault weapons off our streets. We've done it before. I did it when we passed the crime bill last time. And violence went down, shootings went down.
You can't prevent people from being radicalized to violence, but we can address the relentless exploitation of the internet to recruit and mobilize terrorism. We just need to have the courage to do that, to stand up.
Look, the American experiment in democracy is in a danger like it hasn't been in my lifetime. It's in danger this hour. Hate and fear are being given too much oxygen by those who pretend to love America, but who don't understand America.
To confront the ideology of hate requires caring about all people, not making distinctions. Reverend, the Scripture is seeing that we're all part of the Divine. ""Love thy neighbor as thyself."" That's the America I know, that Jill knows. And most deserve the mostwelook, we are the most multiracial, most dynamic nation in the history of the world.
Now is the time for the people of all races, from every background, to speak up as a majority in America and reject White supremacy. These actions we've seen in these hate-filled attacks represent the views of a hateful minority. We can't allow them to distort Americathe real America. We can't allow them to destroy the soul of the Nation.
As President of the United States, I travel the world all the time, and other nations ask meheads of state and other countries ask me: ""What's going on? What in God's name happened on January 6? What happened in Buffalo? What happened""they ask.
We have to refuse to live in a country where Black people going about a weekly grocery shopping can be gunned down by weapons of war deployed in a racist cause. We have to refuse to live in a country where fear and lies are packaged for power and for profit. We must all enlist in this great cause of America.
This is work that requires all of usPresidents and politicians, commentators, citizens. None of us can stay in the sidelines. We have to resolve, here in Buffalo, that from the tragedythis tragedywill come hope and light and life. It has to. And on our watch, the sacred cause of America will never bow, never break, never bend. And the America we lovethe one we lovewill endure.
So, to the families: From your pain, may we find purpose to live a life worthy of the loved ones you lost. From a hymn based on the 91st Psalm, sung at my church: ""May He raise you up on eagle's wings and bear you on the breath of dawn, make you to shine like the sun, and hold you in the palm of His hand."" That's my wish for us.
We can do this if we resolve to do it, if we take on the haters and those who don't even care; it's just about profit and politics. May the soul of the fallen rest in peace and rise in glory. And may God guide the United States of America, now and always.
To the families: As my grandpop used to say when I walked out of his home in Scrantonhe'd say, ""Joey, spread the faith."" And my grandma would yell, ""No, Joey."" I mean, he said, ""Keep the faith."" And my grandma would say, ""No, Joey, spread the faith.""
We're thinking of you. Hold on to each other tightly. Stick together. You'll get through this. And we'll make Buffalo and the United States a better place to live than it is today.

2022-05-16 00:00:00,Remarks With Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis of Greece at a Reception Commemorating 201 Years of Greek Independence,"
The First Lady. Thank you, everyone. Please sit down. And thank you, Your Eminence, for your kind words. Thank you.
And welcome, finally, to the bicentennial celebration and the very infirst in-person Greek heritage event of our administration. And it's so wonderful to see so many friends with us today.
I'm told that there's a Greek proverb that says, ""A society becomes great when its elders plant trees whose shade they know they will never enjoy."" From democracy and philosophy, to astronomy and medicine, to art and literature, the legacy of Greece touches every corner of our culture. We all enjoy the shades of its branches.
And I've had the chance to visit Greece many times over the years. And I've stood in awe at the history of Athens and the beauty of the islands. And each time, I've been welcomed with open arms. So it's my pleasure to be able to return that welcome to you, our Greek and Greek American friends.
And I'm especially honored to welcome Prime Minister Mitsotakis and his wife. [Laughter] And we spent a couple minutes getting to know one another, and it was so nice to get to know you and Sofia and Dafni. You want to stand up and say hello? Your work is so inspiring, and I hope that we can continue to deepen our friendship.
The story of America is the story of all of you. You are a part of our beautiful and rich history. You help write our future every day. And the trees you plant will continue to cover our world. So thank you very much.
And now, as all of you know, this community has been a true partner to my husband throughout the years, and you mean so much to him.
So please welcome your President, my husband, Joe Biden.
President Biden. Thank you. Your Eminence, I've been hanging around with the Greek American community for so long, as a Roman Catholic, I bless myself the wrong way. [Laughter]
[At this point, President Biden made the sign of the cross on his chest.]
I find myself going right. I don't know. Ithe Pope is not real crazy about my change. [Laughter]
Welcome to the White House. It's a welcomeit's wonderful to be able to host this reception again in person and to welcome the Prime Minister to Washington.
We've had good conversations. And I'm delighted to welcome your wife and daughters today andas well, because when it comes to Greek American relations, it's all about family in my experience. As wemy grandfather Finnegan would say, ""That's the Irish of it."" [Laughter]
But I want to welcome Speaker Pelosi. Where are you, Nancy? There you go. And Paul Pelosi, her husband. And to the Members of Congress that are here today, including a great many proud Greek Americans that are here with us today.
And if you will excuse a point of personal privilege, I'd like to introduce John Sarbanes. I want you to know how much we all are thinking about and missing your dad today. Every day. His dad was an enormous influence on me and educated me a lot when I got here as a 30-year-old kid in the United States
The First Lady. And his mom.
President Biden. Oh, is mom there?
The First Lady. Noand missing his mom too.
President Biden. Oh, yes. Excuse me. And missing your mom as well. But your dad really took me school, and I appreciate it.
And, Your Eminence, it's great to get to honor and see you again. What an honor it is. And I want to thank you for your moral leadership and all of the work the Greek Archdiocese of America is doing to shine a light in the world.
And last year, we had to commemorate the bicentennial of independence virtually because of the pandemic. And by the way, I want to thank the proud Greek Americans who are on the forefront of the fight against COVID-19 and our efforts to vaccinate the world.
Last year, we celebrated two hundredthis year, we celebrate 201 years, the end of a year of bicentennial celebrations. And it's an opportunity to honor the history of our two nations and peoples and how we share so much together, a chance to look to the future that we're going to build together.
I'm incredibly proud the first year of my Presidency was able to be the first year of the next 100 years of relations between Greece and the United States of America. [Laughter] It's no exaggeration to say that today our friendship and partnership and our alliance is closer and stronger than it has ever been. We had a great conversation. And the dangerous part for you all is, we like one another a lot. [Laughter]
Our two nations are working together across the board on climate and energy, on trade and investment, on defense and disaster response, and so much more.
And our new Ambassador to Greece, George Tsunis, a proud Greek American, is with us again today. WhereGeorge? I'm not sure if I was prouder to be elected President or George to be named Ambassador, which it was. [Laughter] But Georgethank you, palhas just taken up his post in Athens to continue carrying forward this important work.
And, Prime Minister, I think there is no area as vital for Greece and the United States to stand together than in the defense of our shared and diplomatic principles and our democratic systems.
The United States and the world owe a debt to the ancient Greek ideas that first taught us that ""we the people"" and the ""demos,"" our democracy, can control our own destiny. And weyou made us believe it. And the idea that has endured for a millennia. But it's also an idea that every generation has had to fight to uphold.
Every generation has had to defeat democracy's mortal foes. Because in our imperfect world, the appetites and ambitions of a few forever seek to dominate the lives and liberties of the many. And sadly, we have both discussed, including at the Summit for Democracies last year, that democracy is more under assault today thanincluding in the United Statesthan any time in the recent past.
But the Greek people know, just as the American people do, that freedom and democracy are worth sacrificing for. Just as the ideals of the ancient Athenians inspired America's founders, the American Revolution, I'm presumptuous to say, helped inspire Greek patriots to fight for their own independence over 201 years ago.
And Greece remembers that when dictators and strongmen seek to dominate their neighbors, there is only one answer: Oxi! Oxi!No! No! During World War II, when the Axis forces of fascism were sweeping across Europe, Greece said ""no,"" inspiring the world through its resistance. Today, the war and wisdomand the wanton disinformation have returned to Europe with Russia's brutal and unprovoked attack on its neighbor, Ukraine.
We're seeing horrific atrocities and war crimes, children being buried in mass graves, millions of refugees fleeing Putin's war, and Greece and the United States standing as one to support the people of Ukraine and impose severe economic costs on Russia to hold Putin accountable.
And I want to thank you, Mr. Prime Minister, for the moral courageand I mean it, the moral courageand clarity you have shown from the very beginning of this crisis: speaking out immediately to condemn Russia's aggression, welcoming Ukrainian refugees, being a bulwark of security for NATO's eastern and southeastern Europe and the Mediterranean.
Together, we're showing the power and the capacity of democracies to be able to act in unison. And we're helping Ukrainians say ""no"" to Russian aggression. And we're saying ""no"" to tyranny and to the idea that autocracies will outpace democracies in the 21st century, because that's what is at stake here in my view.
On a personal note, it's wonderful to see so many friends here today. Friends like Andy and Mike Manatoswhere are you guys? There you go. Go back a long waywho have helped with these events over the years since I was a Senator and Vice President.
And Father Alex, who can't be here todayI wanted him to know that he's the reason I bless myself the wrong way. [Laughter]
And my friend from the University of Delaware, President Dennis Assanis. Where are you, Dennis? There you go. The president of the university and his sons, Nicholas and Dimitris. Welcome, gentlemen. It's great to have you both here.
I like to joke about being known as ""Joe Bidenopolous"" in my Greek American community in Delaware. [Laughter] I only own by 3,100 votes when I ran as a United States Senator. And I think we got 92 percent of the Greek vote in Delaware[laughter]and the nickname stuck. Small population.
But the truth is, I've been blessed with lifelong friendships and political mentors in the Greek American community. I've found inspiration in the courage and principled leadership of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America, who fought for social justice and from the daysall the back to the days of Martin Luther King and right through George Floyd. And I thank you. I thank the church.
As a proud Irish American, I've felt a great kinship with the Greek American community. The same values define the way we grew up: courage, decency, honor, treating people with dignity as well as an immense pride in the heart and the heritage of our ancestors that they brought with them to America. This is an incredible resilience among Greek Americans, a determinationa determinationto keep going, to keep fighting, no matter the oddsno matter what.
And there's no greater symbol of the faithfulness and perseverance of the community than seeing Greek Americans proudly celebrate the reconstitution and reconsecration of the Saint Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church and National Shrine last November in Manhattan.
The original structure was destroyed more than 20 years ago during the 9/11 terrorist attacks in ouron our country. And in rebuilding that sacred home of the Greek Orthodox Church and the Greek American community reaffirmed that even in the deepest, darkest days, we always have hope for the future. Always.
And today let us tap into that same spirit and rededicate ourselves to all the hard work that lies ahead: to defend democracy in Greece, in the United States, and all the places where it is under threat today; to stand up to thefor the dignity and rights of all people.
My dad used to have expression that everyone, no matter whateveryoneand this is not a joke; he would say it all the timeis entitled to be treated with dignity. Dignity.
And to renew our commitment to leave our children a world that is more peaceful and more secure and more just than we found it. So I want to thank you again, Mr. Prime Minster, for making the trip and for the excellent discussions we had today. And I look forward to see you again at the NATO summit very soon in Spain and continuing our close cooperation on behalf of our two nations and all of our shared values.
But really, Jill and I are looking forward to seeing in Greece as well. [Laughter]
Thank you. Thank you. The floor is yours.
Prime Minister Mitsotakis. Thank you. Thank you all so much.
Thank you, Mr. President, Dr. Biden. Ladies and gentlemen, it is really a great privilege to be here with you at this bicentennial celebration. My wife, my daughters, my team, myself are tremendously grateful for the warm reception you have offered us.
And honorable guests, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us here tonight. I know this is a very special moment for you, Mr. President. I'm sure you see lots of very good friends amongst this gathering. But this visit, as you pointed out, has very strong historical connotations.
Modern Greece, like America before it, was forged in the hands of dreamers, of revolutionaries fighting for freedom, fighting for justice. And it was the story of your independence struggle and its eventual success, coming as it did decades before ours, that inspired the oppressed Greeks to fight against all odds for their own freedom.
The leaders of the Greek revolution drew inspiration from what was achieved on this soil. Our ancestors did not just dream of freedom and self-determination, they fought for democracy, Mr. President, that elusive government of the people, by the people, for the people, which was invented in ancient Greece 25 centuries ago.
And in his annual message on the 3d December, 1822, President James Monroe remarked: ""The mention of Greece fills the mind with the most exalted sentiments and arouses in our bosoms the best feelings of which nature is susceptible."" ""A strong hope,"" he said, ""is entertained that these people will recover their independence and resume their equal station among the nations of the earth.""
And it is this shared history of struggle, this shared history of sacrifice that binds our two nations together. It places upon us, as you said, a solemn responsibility to protect and defend the values that our forefathers risked so much to pass on to the next generations.
And today, this duty is more relevant than ever. The war in Ukraine, the invasion of Russia is a chilling reminder that what we took for granted in Europethat maps cannot be redrawn by forceis unfortunately no longer the case.
As you know, Mr. President, we supported Ukraine from the very beginning with humanitarian aid, but also with military assistance. We did so for reasons of principle, which should be painfully obvious, but we did so also to protect a world order that is based on the premise of respect for international law, what you like to call a ""rules-based"" international order.
Neoimperial fantasies belong to other centuries. They must not succeed. And they must not succeed not only for the sake of Ukraine, but to send a very clear signal to other authoritarian leaders that any violation of sovereignty will be met by a unified and a forceful response.
And this is why it is so important that Europe and the United States stand shoulder to shoulder in this fight. After all, what we are protecting are the values which lie at the foundations of our liberal democracies. And as a Prime Minister of Greece, but also as a member of the European Council, I would like to thank you again, Mr. President, for your leadership.
The sanctions we have imposed on Russia are crushing and rightly so. But as we discussed, we must not lose sight of the fact that our societies are paying a heavy price in terms of energy prices. And in this respect, there is so much more we can do together, the European Union and the United States, to bring down the prices of energy and, in particular, the price of gas.
And as we reduce our dependence on Russian hydrocarbons, we also need to use our market power as larger purchasers of gas to deliver short-term relief to our households and our businesses.
Mr. President, I really mean it when I say that the relationship between Greece and the United States is today at an alltime high.
Last Thursday, our Parliament ratified the new defense and cooperation agreement between our two countries. And this new cooperation manifests itself not just in the naval base at Souda Bay, on Crete, which I hope you will have an opportunity to visit. It has been described by many as the jewel in the crown of our fantastic military relationship. But it also manifests itself in the port city of Alexandroupolis in northeastern Greece, just 500 miles from the Ukrainian border.
And apart from its military importance for NATO, Alexandroupolis, as we discussed, is rapidly becoming a regional energy hub, an entry point for liquefied natural gas into the Balkans and Eastern Europe.
And Greece plans to play an important role as a gateway for electricity produced from cheap, renewable sources, primarily sun, in the Middle East, in Africa. And we're very happy, Mr. President, that the U.S. has provided its unequivocal support for these projects.
A quick word about our region, Mr. President. You are extremely knowledgeable about the Cyprus issue. And please, use all your influence to put the negotiation process back on track in accordance with the U.N. Security Council resolutions. No oneno onecan or will accept a two-state solution in Cyprus.
The Balkans are also still quite fragile. We must keep their European perspective alive and tangible. Greece is a pillar for regional prosperity and security, and we will always seek peaceful ways to resolve our differences with our neighbors. I'm convinced that we can achieve that.
We place great emphasis on the 3+1 scheme, a framework that connects the U.S. with Greece, with Cyprus, and with Israel. And at the same time, Mr. President, we will continue to invest in our armed forces and make it very clear that we will not accept any violations of our sovereignty and our sovereign rights. And after all, we're doing so in order not just to strengthen Greece, but also in order to strengthen NATO's southeastern flank.
We will continue our longstanding cooperation between our defense industries. We will launch the process for the acquisition of a squadron of F-35 aircraft, and we do hope to be able to add this fantastic plane to the Greek Air Force before the end of this decade.
And I'm happy that, on Friday, Lockheed Martin officially expressed its interest in investing in Hellenic aerospace. Of course, the bonds that connect usthe bonds between America and Greecereach far beyond our shared history, security and defense, and across the board from trade to tourism and technology and cultural exchanges. There is so much, ladies and gentlemen, to be mutually gained.
As you know, Greece has come through severe adversity. The recent economic crisis was extremely painful for our people. But Greeks have proven their resilience. Democracy in Greece has proven its resilience. And today, Greece bears no comparison to the Greece that became the poster boy of European financial crisis a decade ago.
Our economy is strong. Earlier this year, we paid off Greece's outstanding debt to the IMF 2 years ahead of schedule. We are creating jobs and investing in new industries, such as digital and clean tech. Many European companies, wary of their dependence on China, are bringing back manufacturing jobs to the European continent, and Greece is an obvious candidate to welcome them.
And many American companies are investing in Greece for the first time, companies such as Microsoft, Pfizer. They're doing so because they see a country that has an advantageous geographic position, that is both a member of NATO and the European Union, a country with a stable government that is welcoming for investors. Because Greece, Mr. President, is back and a promising future lies ahead of us.
Let me conclude, Mr. President, by saying that you recognize many Greek American friends amongst this gathering tonight. You've mentioned several of them by name. They call you ""Bidenopolous""[laughter]for a reason, although I suggested that maybe you should be called ""Bidenakis."" [Laughter] It would rhyme well.
I'm sure everyone in this audience is particularly proud today. I'm equally proud about what Greek Americans have achieved in the United States. Let me especially acknowledge the presence of your new Ambassador to Greece, George Tsunis. I met him at my office a few days ago. The first thing he told me was a story of his parents leaving a small village in western Greece called Platanos. We're honored to welcome George back to his second homeland. [Laughter]
And, Mr. President, marking this bicentennial, albeit with a year's delay due to COVID, matters deeply to the Greek people and to me personally. Recent events make this celebration that much more pertinent. The fight of democracies against autocracies is a defining battle of our generation. And the proud moments from the history of our two nations give us confidence in what we can achieve in the future.
We should never lose sight of what our ancestors fought for and that which we must now defend. All of us should draw great strength from their example.
I'm hugely grateful to you, Mr. President, and Dr. Biden for hosting this magnificent gathering. And I took your word very seriously that you do intend to visit Greece[laughter]to reciprocate this visit.
Thank you again, all, very much.
The First Lady. You know, my husband has always told me that all politics is personal. And I think that you can see that in the relationship that Joe has with the Prime Minister. And Mareva and I are already making plans to see how we can work together.
And talking about, you know, personal relationships, I want to thank each and every one of you for the relationships that we've formed with all of you and the support that you've given us.
So please enjoy the ""people's house"" with food and drink and music. So we look forward to saying hello. Thank you.

2022-05-16 00:00:00,Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis of Greece,"
President Biden. Well, Mr. Prime Minister, welcome. It's great to have you here. And later this afternoon we're going to celebrate 201 years201 yearsof Greek independence and the strong ties of family and shared democratic values with the United States and a burgeoning personal friendship between you and I. You've been wonderful.
The democratic ideals that we so cherish originated in Greece, as we all know, inspired by our Founders, who were students of Greece, and for centuries has empowered
[At this point, a cell phone rang.]
Someone's playing music. Anybody want to make that phone call? [Laughter] There you go. Thank you. It happens all the time. Don't worry about it.
Sadly, Russia's brutal attack on Ukraine is also about a threat to democracy from autocrats who want to bear down on rules-tested orders and rule-based orders. I want to thank you, Mr. Prime Minister, for Greeks' moral leadership here. It's not easy, I know. But thank you.
And we have much to discuss today: our ongoing support for Ukraine, our deepening defense and trade partnerships, energy security, climate change, and so much more.
Today, the friendship and partnership between our countries, between Greek andGreeks and Americans is, I think, more important than ever. And I'm honored to celebrate that partnership with you because you've been a good friend. So, welcome.
The floor is yours.
Prime Minister Mitsotakis. Well, thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. President, for these kind words. It is indeed a privilege for me to be here in the United States to celebrate with you 201 years since the beginning of our war of independence.
As you know, your Founding Fathers were inspired by the ideals of Athenian democracy, and our founding fathers were inspired by the struggle for independence on these lands. And over the past two centuries, our two countries have always been on the right side of history. We fought in wars together. And of course, we are now facing, united, the challenge of Russia's invasion into Ukraine.
At the same time, this visit is an opportunity to reassess the status of our relationship. I honestly believe it is at an alltime high.
President Biden. So do I.
Prime Minister Mitsotakis. And I'm not just speaking about the defense component of the relationship, but I'm also speaking about trade, investment, Greece's role as a reliable partner in the eastern Mediterranean, as a country that overcame the financial crisis with a booming economy, and as a pillar of stability both in the Balkans and in the broader region.
So, when we talk about issues such as energy security, there's so much more we can do together.
And I'm very, very happy to be here with you to discuss these important topics and, later, to be able to address also your many Greek American friends. And I know how close your ties are to Greeks and Greek Americans. And it's a privilege to have them here at the White House.
President Biden. Well, I'm delighted you're here. Thank you. And I look forward to our discussion.

2022-05-16 00:00:00,Remarks on Presenting the Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor,"
Thank you, General. Thank you very much. And welcome to the White House, everyone. The Attorney General Garland's introduction is incredibly worthwhile. We're here to recognize your leadership and all you've done.
You know, we're also joined by Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monacois hereand the Drug Enforcement Agency, Anne Milgram. Where's Anne? Anne is in the back.
And I would like to thank Members of Congress here today: Senator Chris MurphyChris. And I also want JimJimmy HimesJim Himes is here with us today. And Congressman Adriano Esplanat. AndEspaillat, excuse me. You can call me ""Bidden."" [Laughter] We've known each other so long, and I still stumbled. I apologize.
It's good to see you all. And you know, they represent members of the districts that many of you are from. And of course, we're honored to be joined by law enforcement and firefighter leaders from all across the country.
We can never fully thank you for your service or for your sacrifice. But today is an important day for the Nation to give thanks for all that you do for everybody, for all of us.
Because of COVID-19, we couldn't have this special ceremony for the past 2 years. But I'm honored that we finally can today honor 1515public safety officers from eight different departments with the Medal of Valor, the highest award a President can bestow on a public safety officer.
This designation reads, and I quote: ""For action above and beyond the call of duty; and exhibiting exceptional courage, extraordinary decisiveness and presence of mind, or unusual swiftness [in]* action, regardless of his or her personal safety, in an attempt to save or protect human life."" End of quote. That's valor. That's valor.
To the honorees: I don't know all of you personally, but I do know you. Growing up, you're the ones who, when we were outnumbered three to one, you jumped in. No, you did. I grew up in a neighborhood where you either became a cop, a firefighter, or a priest. I wasn't qualified for any of them, so here I am. [Laughter]
But you know, and you jumped in to help the one. Not a joke. Think aboutand your parents can attest to it. You were the ones to run into help when everyone else ran away, even before you became involved in firefighting or law enforcement.
As adults, you're the first ones to volunteer to coach a Little League team or shovel your neighbor or elderly neighbor's driveway or walkway when it snows. You're the heart and soul and the very spinethe very spineof this country and your communities.
Each one of you, from small-town departments to big cities, you're cut from the same cloth. You possess a selflessness that's really hard to explain, a rare commitment to your neighbors and your fellow Americans, an unusual bravery that inspires everyone. And you've been singled out because of your extraordinary heroism.
In a few moments, a full citation of your valor will be read. But this is who you are. You plunged into icy lake waters toand dove into choppy oceans to save people who were drowning. You faced a hail of gunfire to save your colleagues. You climbed burning buildings to save a baby and more than a hundred senior citizens. You drew fire to yourselfto yourselfto save a hostage.
And you did all this without concern for your own safety, thinking only of somebody elsethe other. You know, you've gone above and beyond. I think it's instinctive. Because this job isn't just what you do, it's who you all are. It's really who you are.
But we also know you didn't do this alone. To the parents who are here today, you getyou set a standard for remarkable public safety officers. They didn't just get this by osmosis; they got it through all of you. Something about the example you set made them want to do what they do.
I want to thank you moms and dads here for teaching your children the values that we honor today, because what we're honoring is their basic values.
And I want to thank the spouses and the children of the honorees. It takes a special person to marry or a childto be the child of a firefighter or a law enforcement officer. How many times have you sat in front of the steps of your house when the city lights have gone out, and you turn to your husband or your wife, holding your kids and say: ""We'll be fine. We'll be fine. Go do your job. Go do your job""?
You know, when your loved one puts on that shield and walks out the door each day, every family member dreads the possibility of receiving that phone call, knowing the uncertainty that faces you as they walk out the door. So today, from the bottom of our hearts, we thank you, the spouses, the children of the public safety officers. And I really mean it.
And there are two families in particular I want to acknowledge. Two of our honorees, Officer Jason Shuping and Lieutenant Jared Lloyd, are not with us today because they gave their lives in the full service to their communities and this Nation. To their families, unless you would rather not, I'd like you to stand so everybody can see you.
On behalf of the American people, my wife Jill and I want to extend our love. We know from personal, but different experience, that these events are really bittersweet. It brings everything back as if you just got the news. You're proud, but it's hard.
Just yesterday I stood at the United States Capitol for the National Police [Peace]* Officers Memorial Service to pay tribute to hundreds of fallen heroes. And I was joined by the president of the Fraternal Order of Police, Patrick Yoes, who is here today. I don't know where Patrick is, but I know he's here today. There you go, Patrick. Thank you for yesterday, and thank you for today.
We pay tribute to all the law enforcement officers and their families who understand what it takes, what's at risk to save and protect all of us. And that includes paying tribute to the Buffalo Police Officer Aaron SalterSlater [Salter],* excuse mewho gave his life trying to save others when a gunman shot and killed 10 innocent people in a grocery store in Buffalo on Saturday. He actually was able to shoot the assailant twice, but he had on a bulletproof vest. And he lost his life in the process.
No one understands more than all of you here today the pain and anguish those families in Buffalo feel. But if they were pulled into aas ifwhen it happens, at least in my experience, you feel like you're pulled into a black hole inside your chest and everythingeverything you can'tand it's hard.
But as you know, you're part of a special communitya special communitybecause the firefighters and police officers will always be there for you. I know it's a small consolation, but they'll always be there for you and your family and your children and your grandchildren and the whole family.
To talk about law enforcement being a family, about firefighters being a family, it's real, just like being a military family. It's unbreakable. There is a headstone in a cemetery in Ireland that reads: ""Death leaves a heartache no one can heal, love leaves a memory that no one can steal."" To the families of the fallen, no one can ever steal the memory of your loved one.
And I hope the day will come when the memory of your lost dad, son, husband brings a smile to your lips before it brings the tear to your eye. I promise you, it will come, but you know, my prayer is, it comes sooner than later.
You know, I want to say a special thanks to theto you all for being here because I know it's hard andbut understand all the people in this room and all the people listening, they understand the sacrifices that not only thatthat your spouse made, your son made, but you make every day. And all the families that are herelike I said, when that alarm goes off, when the bell sounds, you all wish them well, but you know and you worry. Thank you for all you do.
I'd like to conclude with this. There is an incredible group of 15 heroes. I know you don't do this work for recognition, but you reflect the best part of who we are as Americans. These medals reflect the profound gratitude of our Nation. It's the highest medal that can be honored.
So God bless you all. May God protect our firefighters and law enforcement officers and their families everywhere.
And it's now my honor now to award these medals and ask the Military Aides to read the citations. Thank you.
[At this point, Lt. Col. Raymond Roe, USAF, Air Force Aide to the President, read the citations, and the President presented the medals, assisted by Lt. Col. William Kerrigan, USMC, Marine Corps Aide to the President.]
A vacation he'll never forget. [Laughter]
I would like to give one last round of applause to the recipients of the Medal of Valor. Thank you all for your service and sacrifice.
And may God bless you, keep you safe. And may God protect all firefighters and all police officers. Like I said, you're the character of the country, and you're the best of all of them. Thank you all for being here. Appreciate it.
[The President paused briefly to face the audience before leaving the stage.]
Thanks, everybody. I really mean it.

2022-04-02 00:00:00,"Remarks on Commemorating the USS Delaware Commissioning in Wilmington, Delaware","
The President. My name is Joe Biden. I am Jill's husband. [Laughter]
It's always a good day when I get to celebrate Delaware or spend time with servicemembers and their families or introduce Jill. [Laughter] That's a trifecta in my family.
Governor Carney, Senator Carper, Senator Coons, Congresswoman Blunt Rochester, Secretary Del Toro, Commander Horton, and all the crew members and families of the USS Delaware: I'm genuinely honored to be with you.
This latest ship to carry the USS Delaware is part of a longthe nameis part of a long tradition of serving our Nation proudly and strengthening our Nation's securitythe security of the United States of Americanot just us, but our allies and partners around the world as well. In fact, it's already been doing that for some time.
So I just want to say thank you to everyoneto everyoneinvolved in bringing this submarine into service: for those who laid the keel, for those sailors who will crew it and allthrough all the years to come.
And I want you to know that I've had an incredible partner. Jill has watched over the progress of the USS Delaware for years. The daughter of a Navy signalman during World War II, the mother of a member of the Delaware National Guard, the grandmother of children who experienced having their father deployed away from home for a year at a time. She always holds our military and their families in her heart. And that is not hyperbole, that's real.
And I'm deeply proud of the work she is doing as First Lady with Joining Forces initiative she started with Michelle Obama when she [I]* was Vice President and now carries on. As First Lady, she doesn'tshe's been to more military installations around the world. She's hosted more than 20 events for military families.
And she's workingworkingto expand economic opportunities for military spouses whoby the way, in the words of Keats, ""They also serve who only stand and wait."" And a submariner's spouse stands and waits a lot. And to help military kids for the support they need and to make sure survivors and caregivers have the resources they deserve.
It's a true passion for Jill and for our entire family. As your Commander in Chief, I believe it is our sacred obligation as a nation forto prepare and equip those troops that we send into harm's way and to care for them and their families when they return home.
Nownowit's my honor to introduce your First Lady, the sponsor of this great vessel, Jill Biden.
The First Lady. Thank you, Mr. President. [Laughter] I must admit, I never get tired of saying that. [Laughter]
As this ship's sponsor, it's my pleasure to welcome so many distinguished guests and especially the Secretary of the Navy and Admirals Gilday and Caudle.
Commander Horton, Senior Chief Grammer, and the entire crew of the USS Delaware, it's an honor to share this special day with you and your families. I especially want to welcome some of my good friends from Delaware Boots on the Ground. You know, working with you connected me to a community of incredible military families. And all these years later, your work continues to inspire me, and I hope you can see your influence in our Joining Forces initiative.
So where are my Delaware Boots on the Ground members today? Where are they sitting?
Audience member. They're down.
The First Lady. They're down. They're down. Okay. Wow, you're down there? [Laughter]
The State of Delaware has loved the Bidens and cheered for us in most of our triumphant moments. It has carried us through the darkest times in our lives with a kindness that asks for nothing in return. Delaware is family.
I'll never forget the pride I felt when I stood at the Pentagon with Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus, as well as you, Tom, to announce that I would be this ship's sponsor. The USS Delaware was nothing more than a drawing then.
In 2016, my grandson Hunter joined me for the keel laying. And I think he felt the important connection that our family has to service then, and it was such a special moment for both of us.
Then, in 2018, I traveled to Newport News for the christening, seeing that simple drawing come to life in a shower of champagne. And I saw the truth of what Secretary Mabus said when it all began, that this vessel will always uphold the First State's motto of ""liberty and independence.""
So it's difficult to put into words how much it means to be a part of the USS Delaware family. It's an incredible honor that I take seriously. I have cherished getting to know this community, from bowling with you at Newport News, to spending time with your families at Fort Groton for the holiday last December. I've seen the heart of this crew, and it makes me feel both proud and humbled to be your shipmate for life.
Today's celebration, like so many things in the past few years, is just a bit out of the ordinary. At the beginning of the pandemic, the Delaware became the first ship ever commissioned while underwater, underway. It was a challenge to put a ship in service in the middle of a global pandemic, but you rose to the occasion as you always do.
Even if we are a little delayed in our celebration, today marks the beginning of an incredible journey: this ship's long and faithful service to our country. We may not know what's to come, but we do know this: The challenges will be met with honor, distinction, and valor of the 125 sailors who serve on her decks. You will lead with unparalleled character and courage.
Of course, commissionings also mark a beginning for the families of the sailors, as well. Though the spouses and the children, parents and siblings with us today will stay on dry land, a piece of their hearts will sail away again and again. You too have a mission; you too serve our Nation.
And as we look at this warship, we see its steel bulkheads and unbreakable hull. We see that it's strong enough to withstand the most crushing pressure and slip silently through the deadliest waters. And yet so much of its power is unseen: the engines and sonar, the rudders that give it direction and purpose.
You, the families of this crew, may not wear a uniform, but with your love and support and with your sacrifice and devotion, you are as critical to our mission as the rudder is to this submarine. Sailors, as you venture to new waters, know that the families who remain ashore will not be forgotten by your President or by me. We are working every day to honor the sacrifices that all of you make.
When our son Beau deployed to Iraq, another military mom shared with me a prayer, one that I said every night while he was deployed. And it goes like this:
May the deep waters bring you more solace than strife.
May the friendships you find warm the cold walls of this vessel with laughter.
May you feel the glow of each goodbye embrace long after the horizon has lost the shore.
May that light illuminate even the dimmest berthing.
May you always return home safely to the arms of the people who love you most.
And may God bless our troops and your families no matter where your journey takes you.
Amen.
Governor Carney, Senators Carper and Coons, Congresswoman Blunt Rochester, thank you for this celebration today. And to our sailors: Thank you for your service and sacrifice. Thank you for allowing me to be your shipmate for life.
Everybody is here? Okay?
Senior Chief Petty Officer Travis L. Grammer, USN. Yes, ma'am.
The First Lady. Okay.
Okay, shipmates: Officers and crew of the USS Delaware, man our ship and bring her to life!
Crewmembers. Aye, aye, ma'am! [Laughter]

2022-04-01 00:00:00,Remarks on the Bureau of Labor Statistics Report on the Employment Situation in March,"
The President. Good morning.
Today we learned that in March, our economy created 431,000 jobs. Nice sound to it. We also learned that in January and February, our economy created 100,000 more jobs than hadwe previously had thought. That means that over the last 3 months, the economy has created more than a half-millionmore than 500,000jobs a month.
Over the course of my Presidency, our recovery has now created 7.9 million jobs, more jobs created over the first 14 months of any Presidency in any term ever. And that's striking. But what's even more striking is this: In March, the unemployment rate fell to 3.6 percent, down from 6.4 percent when I took office about 15 months ago, the fastest decline in unemployment to start a President's term ever recorded.
In fact, there have been only 3 months in the last 50 years where the unemployment rate in America is lower than it is now. And that meanswhat it means is clear, is very clear: Americans are back to work. And that's good news for millions of families who have a little more breathing room and the dignity that comes from earning a paycheck, just the dignity of having a job.
And more and more Americans get jobsas they do, it's going to help ease the supply pressures we've seen. And that's good news for fighting inflation, it's good news for our economy, and it means that our economy has gone from being on the mend to being on the move.
You know, the American people, I think they're beginning to understand that the American Rescue Planand there's no reason why they should know the names of all these pieces of legislation that got passedbut the American Rescue Plan, with it, we were able to get Americans vaccinated, schools opened, and businesses humming.
A leading financial firm, Moody's, estimated that because of the Rescue Plan, 4 million more American jobs were created and unemployment is 2-percent lower than it would have been had we failed to move that legislation. Thanks to our infrastructure law, we have more than 4,000 projects getting started this year4,000in every single State in America, a total of 4,000 in all 50 States, rebuilding America.
We're building a recovery worth ofworthy of American workers: strong and resilient. And it's going to be able to overcome the headwindsand it hasof Delta, Omicron, and even war in Europe.
Our policies are working. And we're getting results for the American people, which is what it's all about, to state the obvious: record job creation, record unemployment declines, record wage gains. And by the way, jobs and unemployment are not just another statistic. They go directly to the core of what the economy represents: the ability for hard-working Americans to live with dignity, support their families, and build a better life for their children.
People are making more money. They're finding better jobs. And after decades of being mistreated and paid too little, more and more American workers have real power now to get better wages and to do what's best for themselves and their families.
Some people see that as a problem; we've had this discussion in the past. I don't. I see it as long overdue.
So when you hear these numbers, they're not statistics; it's a statement of the type of economy we're fighting for: an economy, as I've been saying from the beginning, built from the bottom up and the middle out, not from the top down. When we do it that way, everybody does well, everybody wins.
Even though we've created a record number of jobs, we knowI knowthat this job is not finished. We need to do more to get prices under control.
Putin's invasion of Ukraine has driven up gas prices and food prices all over the world. To help deal with that, yesterday I authorized the release of 1 million barrels per day for the next 6 months from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
I acknowledge this, by far, is the largest release from our national reserves in our history. It is a wartime bridgeis the way I look at itto increase our oil supply as we work with our oilU.S. oil producers to ramp up their production to get us through this period.
I've coordinated this release with partners and allies around the world. This morning over 30 countries from across the world convened an extraordinary meeting and agreed to the release of tens of millions of additional barrels of oil onto the market.
Hundreds of hours of meetings with key allies, keeping them together, is paying off. Nations are coming together to deny Putin the ability to weaponize his energy resources against American familiesnot only American families, but families in Europe and around the world.
I've also made it a priority to get America's fiscal house in order. Under my predecessor, the Federal budget deficit went up every single yearevery year. As I committed when I was running and as soon as I got here, we're going to turn that around.
In fact, last year, in 2021, we cut the Federal deficit by more than $350 billion. And this year, in 2022, we're on track to cut the deficit by more than $1.3 trillion1.3 trillion. That would be the largest 1-year reduction in the deficit in U.S. history. And it's particularly important now as we work to reduce pressures on inflation. That's what happens when you reduce the deficit.
So here are the facts: It was the previous administration whose reckless policies and mismanagement led to the record budget deficits. In my administration, that's getting the deficit under control.
In fact, I just released my budget this week, and it shows, going forward, we can cut the deficit by another $1 trillion over the next decade while still making prudent investments in economic growth, in climate, and other equitable economic decisions. But to do that, we have to be willing to do something previous administrations and Republicans today refuse to do. We need to make sure corporations and the super wealthy begin to pay their fair share.
Here's one example: Right now billionairesand there's not a whole lot of them in the country; maybe I won't give a number, because I don't know for sure. They average less than 1 percent. But my point is, billionaires pay an average rate of only 8 percent on their total income. A family led by a firefighter and a teacher can pay double that income tax rate: double what a billionaire pays; double the 8 percent.
So my budget has a billionaire minimum tax: a 20-percent minimum tax that applies only to the top oneone-hundredth of 1one-hundredth of 1 percent of American households. The billionaire minimum tax is fair. And here's the deal: It raises $360 billion that can be used to lower costs for families and cut the deficit. It would addit wouldand I would add, nobody making less than 4and you're tired of hearing me say itbut no one making less than $400,000 a year will pay a single penny more in Federal taxes.
As I've said in the past, I'm a capitalist. I have no problem with people making as much money as they are capable of making. But I'm asking you one simple question: Just pay your fair share. Pay your fair share. That's all. That's it. Just your fair share. And no one can argue that 20 percent for a billionaire is unfair.
Here's what this adds up to: We're going to continue to create jobs, bring down the cost for families, and rein in deficits left by my predecessor, all important steps in ourto continue our historic progress to build a better America.
I said from the outset we're the only country in the world that comes out of crises stronger than we went into them. That's what we're doing here.
I want to thank you all for showing up today. And we'll have plenty of time to answer questions about other items other than the jobs report next week. Thank you. Appreciate it.

2022-03-31 00:00:00,Remarks on Efforts To Reduce Gasoline Prices and an Exchange With Reporters,"
The President. Good afternoon. As I said in my State of the Union Address, I'm going to always be honest with the American people. Today I want to talk with you about the costs here at home of Putin's decision to brutally and savagely invade a sovereign nation. Fact is, he's causing thousands of deaths and untold destruction.
Working with our NATO allies and our European partners and beyond that, we're responding. We're aiding the Ukrainian people both economically and militarily while leaving the most punishing economic sanctions against Russia ever used against another nation in place and increasing them.
Thus far, these actions are crippling Russia's economy, isolating Putin from the world, and helping Ukrainians fight for their country and ease their suffering. But as I've said from the start, Putin's war is imposing a cost on America and our allies and democracies around the world.
Today I want to talk about one aspect of Putin's war that affects and has real effects on the American people: Putin's price hike that Americans and our allies are feeling at the pump.
I know how much it hurts. As you've heard me say before, I grew up in a family, like many of you, where when the price of a gallon of gasoline went up, it was discussed at the kitchen table. Our family budgets, your family budgets to fill a tanknone of it should hinge on whether a dictator declares war.
So today I'm laying out a two-part plan not only to ease the pain that families are feeling right now, but to end this era of dependence and uncertainty and to lay a new foundation for true and lasting American energy independence.
Parenthetically, just imagine if in fact Europe didn't have to count on Russian oil, if they were energy independent. It would change the nature of so much.
The problem we're facing with gas prices has two roots. First, the pandemic. When COVID struck, demand for oil plummeted, so production slowed down worldwide. Because of the strength and the speed of our recovery, demand for oil shot back up much faster than the supply. That's why the cost of gas began to rise last year.
The second root is Vladimir Putin. At the start of this year, gas was about $3.30 a gallon. Today, it's aboutaveraging $4.20, $4.22. It's higher in many States, nearly a dollar more in less than 3 months. And the reason for that is because of Putin's war.
And now many people are no longer buying Russian oil around the world. I banned the Russian import of oil here in America; Republicans and Democrats in Congress called for it and supported it. It was the right thing to do. But I said at the time, it's going to come with a cost. As Russian oil comes off the global market, supply of oil drops and prices are rising.
Now Putin's price strikeprice hike is hitting Americans at the pump, which brings me to the first part of my plan: to immediately increase the supply of oil. Our prices are rising because of Putin's actions. There isn't enough supply. And the bottom line is, if we want lower gas prices, we need to have more oil supply right now.
For U.S. oil companies that are recording their largest profits in years, they have a choice. One, they can put those profits to productive use by producing more oils, restarting idle wells, or producing on the sites they already are leasing, giving the American people a break by passing some of the savings on to their customers and lowering the price at the pump. Or they can, as some of them are doing, exploit the situation: sit back, ship those profits to the investors, andwhile American families struggle to make ends meet.
Look, this is a moment of consequence and peril for the world and pain at the pump for American families. It's also a moment of patriotism. I want to acknowledge those companies that have already announced they're increasing immediate production. They're investing money to produce more oil and also clean technology we need to reduce our dependence on oil in the future.
They have everything they need. Nothing's standing in their way. And they've indicated they will be producing an extra 1 million barrels of oil per day, probably starting as early as this fall. That's progress.
But some companies have been pretty blunt. They don't want to increase supply because Putin's price hike means higher profits. One CEO even acknowledged that they don't care if the price of a barrel of oil goes to $200 a barrel. They're not going to step up the production.
I say: Enough. Enough of lavishing excessive profits on investors and payouts and buybacks when the American people are watching, the world is watching.
U.S. oil companies made nearly $80 billion in profit last year. And this year, those profits are expected to continue to soar. This is the timenot the time to sit on record profits. It's time to step up for the good of your country and the good of the world; to invest in immediate production that we need to respond to Vladimir Putin; to provide some relief for your customers, not investors and executives.
Look, I'm a capitalist. I have no problem with corporations turning a good profit. But companies have an obligation that goes beyond just their shareholders: to their customers, their communities, and their country.
No American company should take advantage of a pandemic or Vladimir Putin's actions to enrich themselves at the expense of American families. Investing those profits in production and innovation, that's what they should do. Invest in your customers. And it isn't just likeit's not the patriotic duty, it's good for your business as well.
Right now oil and gas industry is sitting on nearly 9,000 unused but approved permits for production on Federal lands. There are more than a million [12 million]* unused acres they have a right to pump on. Families can't afford that companies sit on thesetheir hands.
So to help execute this first part of my plan, I'm calling for a ""use it or lose it"" policy. Congress should make companies pay fees on wells on Federal leases they haven't used in years and acres of public land they're hoarding without production.
Companies that are already producing from these wells won't be affected. But those sitting on unused leases and idle wells will either have to start producing or pay the price for their inaction.
Look, the action I'm calling for will make a real difference over time. But the truth is, it takes months, not days, for companies to increase production. That's why the next part of my plan is so important.
Today I'm authorizing the release of 1 million barrels per day for the next 6 monthsover 180 million barrelsfor the Strategicfrom the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. This is a wartime bridge to increase oil supply until production ramps up later this year. And it is by far the largest release of our national reserve in our history. It will provide a historic amount of supply for a historic amount of time: a 6-months bridge to the fall. And we'll use the revenue from selling the oil now to restock the Strategic Petroleum Reserve when prices are lower so we'll be readywe'll be readyfor future emergencies.
Folks, I've coordinated this release with allies and partners around the world. Already, I have commitwe have commitments from other countries to release tens of millions of additional barrels into the market. Together, our combined efforts towill supply well over a million barrels a day, nations coming together to deny Putin the ability to weaponize his energy resources against American families and families and democracies around the world.
Now, for the first part of my plan is about meeting an immediate crisis. The second part is about declaring real American energy independence in the long term so that we never have to deal with this problem again.
Ultimately, we and the whole world need to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels altogether. We need to choose long-term security over energy and climate vulnerability. We need to double down on our commitment to clean energy and tackling the climate crisis with our partners and allies around the world.
And we can do that by passing my plan that is literally before the Senate right nowthe United States Congress right now. It's been there for well over a monthto speed the transition to a clean energy future that's made in America with American products and American values.
We need to embrace all the tools and technologies that can help usfree us from our dependence on fossil fuels and move us toward a more homegrown clean energy; technologies made by American companies and American workers so we can bolster democratic supplyexcuse medomestic supply chains here at home and export those technologies around the world to reduce greenhouse gases.
That's why today I am issuing a directive to strengthen our clean energy economy. I'm going to use the Defense Production Act to secure American supply chains for the critical materials that go into batteries for electric vehicles and the storage of renewable energy: lithium, graphite, nickel, and so much more.
We need to end our long-term reliance on China and other countries for inputs that will power the future. And I'll use every tool I have to make that happen.
Yes, building a ""made in America"" clean energy future will help safeguard our national security. Yes, it will help us tackle climate change. Yes, it's going to help us ensure that America's creating millions of good-paying jobs for generations to come.
But most importantthe most important thing my plan will do right away is save your family money. And here's what I mean: Under my plan, which is before the Congress now, we can take advantage of the next generation of electric vehicles that a typical driver will save about $80 a month from not having to pay gas at the pump. If your home is powered by safer, cheaper, cleaner electricity, like solar or heat pumps, you can save about $500 a month [year]* on average.
Don't take my word for it. The CEOs of 11 of America's largest utility companies came to see me at the White House several weeks ago. They told me if we pass my plans before the Congress now, typical families will see savings show up in their utility bills immediately. And costs will come down even more as we innovate and develop cutting-edge energy storage technologies, clean hydrogen technology, advanced nuclear technology, carbon capture and sequestration technologies.
And by the way, this weeks, the benefit I included in the bipartisan infrastructure law to help families weatherize their homes are being delivered. My administration is making $3.2 billion available from this legislation to provide up to $6,500 direct payment for working class families to be able to weatherize their homes, to save them money, to keep them warm in the winter and cool in the summer. It's a direct grant.
This program has been around for a while, and in the past, it's delivered to familiesaverage families another $327 [$372]* in savings when they weatherize. But now we have the ability to reach 10 times as many families because of the legislation that we already passed in the legislation.
In addition to that, we're also setting new standards to boost fuel economies for new vehicles sold in America. Within 5 years, we're going to travel 10 miles more on every single gallon we have, because the average fuel economy of 49 miles to the gallon is going to be required. That means hundreds of dollars in savings for families at the pump.
We're also setting similar standards for appliances, from your air conditioner to your microwave, your refrigerator, washers, dryers. It's just one of a hundred actions we're taking to save the average family $100 per year in utility bills.
Look, the bottom line is this: Between rapping upramping up production in the short term and driving down demand in the long term, we can free ourselves from our dependence on imported oil from across the world.
Look, I know gas prices are painful. I get it. My plan's going to help ease that pain today and safeguard againagainst tomorrow. I'm open to ideas to strengthen the plan, but I will not be put off and put it on hold.
It's time to deliver true long-term energy independence in America once and for all. And I'm going to continue to use every tool at my disposal to protect you from Putin's price hike. It's not time for politics. America'sAmericans can't afford that right now. So let's meet this moment together.
Remember, we're the only nation that has turned every crisis we ever faced into an opportunity. We have a crisis: the price at the pump. So let's show some true strength of this Nationshow our unity, our resolve, our innovative spirit in Americaand come out of this, long term, much better off. If we stand up to the bullies of the world, the autocrats, and the dictators, we stand up for who those who are ready to uniteunite with us, the United States of America.
So may God bless you, and may God protect our troops. Thank you.
Q. Mr. President, how badly is Vladimir Putin being misinformed by his advisers?
Q. Mr. President, the ruble is back, sir. Mr. President, the ruble is back at the prewar level.
President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin of Russia 
Q. How badly is Vladimir Putin being misinformed by his advisers?
The President. That's an open question. There's a lot of speculation, but he seems to beI'm not saying this with a certaintyhe seems to be self-isolating. And there's some indication that he has fired or put under house arrest some of his advisers. But I don't want to put too much stock in that at this time because we don't have that much hard evidence.
Q. Mr. President
Gasoline Prices 
Q. Mr. President, how much, in monetary terms, do you estimate today's document will reduce gas prices? And when can Americans expect to see these changes?
The President. That's a really important question, and there's no firm answer to it. But prices already came down when it was announced ahead of time that Biden was going to release so muchand so much energy fromso many barrels of oil from the SPRO. They're already come down.
My guess is, we'll see it come downcontinue to come down. But how far down, I don't think anyone can tell.
And there's going to be a slight delay, because if you go out there and you're a gas station and you purchased x amount of gas at a certain price, you're not going to lower the price of the pump until you're able to get back what you invested. And thatI'm talking a matter of, I think, you know, days and weeks. But it's hard to tell.
And the other thing isexact. But it will come down. And it could come down fairly significantly. It could come down the better part ofyou know, anything from 10 cents to 35 cents a gallon. It's unknown at this point.
I'm also waiting to see whether or not our alliesexactly how many barrels they release from their supplies now. My guess is, it could be as highsomewhere between 30 million to 50 million barrels. And the higher the number, the more likely the price is to come down.
Q. Mr. President
Thank you all very much. I appreciate it. Thank you.
[At this point, reporters shouted questions as the President was leaving the room.] 
Q. Mr. President, have you seen any sign
Q. Mr. President, is buying oilMr. President, is buying oil from Venezuela out of the table?
President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin of Russia/Ukraine 
Q. Mr. President, have you seen any signs that Putin is pulling back his forces?
The President. No.
Q. You say he's not pulling back his forces?
Q. The ruble is back at prewar levels, sir? Are the sanctions still working, sir? Are the sanctions still working, sir? The ruble's back.
Q. Wait, wait, hold on.
[The President returned to respond to reporters.]
The President. Whoa, whoa, whoa. I'll answer one questionyour question.
Q. Thank you.
The President. The question is: Is he pulling back his forces? Whoever asked that question
Q. I asked that. Yes.
The President. The question of whether he's pulling back his forces depends on how you read exactly what's going on. Thus far, there is no clear evidence that he's pulling all of his forces out of Kyiv. And there is also evidence that he is beefing up his troops down in the Donbas area.
Depending on your view of PutinI'm a little skepticalit's an open question whether he's actually pulling back and going to say, ""I'm just going to focus on the Donbas, and I'm not worried about the rest of the country.""
I'm a skeptic. Ibut I don't have proof that, in fact, he is not goinghe is taking a pause, doing all he can to use all the troops he has in the Donbas and continue to keep an eye on and try to move beyond the rest of the country.
Don't know the answer. But it appears, so far, that he has not pulled all of histhe idea he's pulling all the troops out from around Kyiv and moving south, there's no evidence that he's done that.
Thank you.

Q. Are you considering a gas tax holiday? Are you considering a gas tax holiday?

2022-03-30 00:00:00,Remarks on the Federal COVID-19 Response and National Vaccination Efforts and an Exchange With Reporters,"
The President. Good afternoon. Today I'd like to update you all on where we stand on COVID-19.
Because of the strategy we executed over the past year on vaccinations, testing, treatments, and more, we're now in a new moment in this pandemic. It does not mean that COVID-19 is over, it means that COVID-19 no longer controls our lives. That's what it means.
Cases are ticking up, as we thought they might. But now, thanks to the foundation we've laid, America has the tools to protect peopleall the people. And you know, as we've done onfrom day one, my administration is making it easier than ever for Americans to access these tools.
Today I'm announcing the launch of COVID.govCOVID.gova one
[At this point, the President cleared his throat.]
excuse me, a one-stop shop where anyone in America can find what they need to navigate the virus: free vaccines and boosters, free at-home tests, high-quality masks. And for the latest information about the level of COVID-19 spread in your community, you can get that immediately.
Now, you'll also be able to find our new test-to-treat locations, which I announced in my State of the Union Address. These are pharmacies and other places in your neighborhood where you can get tested. And if you're positive, you can get lifesaving treatments all in one stop.
We've already stood up 2,000 test-to-street sitestest-and-treat sites across the country. We're also nearly atwe have nearly 200 sites just to serve military families and veterans communities as well. We've donewhat we've done throughout the pandemic, we've ensured there arethese locations are at the hardest hit, hardest to reach communities as well.
The bottom line: No longer will Americans have to scour the internet to find vaccines, treatments, tests, or masks. It's all there. And just go visit COVID.govCOVID.gov.
And let me remind you: When I took office about 14 months ago, the pandemic was raging, the economy was reeling, and the deficit was soaring. Most schools were closed. We didn't have enough vaccines. The unemployment claims were sky high. And then we got to work, and we delivered: enough vaccines for every American months ahead of schedule, effective treatments, at-home tests that are free and accessible.
Over 99 percent of our schools are open again. Businesses are open again. And because of how we responded, we created more jobs last year than ever before: 6.7 million jobs. And by the way, we did it while cutting the deficit, the largest 1-year deficit reduction in American history. Say that again: The largest 1-year deficit reduction in American history.
But none of that happened by accident. We were able to do it because we coordinated across the Government, partnered with State and local leaders, Governors on both sides of the aisle, and the private sector to leverage every resource we had to fight against this virus. We left no stone unturned. And we were able to do it because Congress worked with us and provided us the necessary funding.
But now, just as we've reached the critical turning point in this fight, Congress has to provide the funding America needs to continue to fight COVID-19. We're already seeing the consequences of congressional inaction. The monoclonal antibodiestake monoclonal antibodies, for example. They've helped save lives. This isn't partisan, it's medicine. But Congress hasn't provided enough money to keep purchasing these monoclonal antibodies. We've had to cancel planned orders and cut the supply we're sending to the States. Without more funding, we'll start to run out of them by the end of Maythe end of May.
We've also had to scale back our plan to purchase more preventive therapies for Americans who are immunocompromised, critical tools to protect the most vulnerable among us. Without more funding, we risk running out of the supply by this fall.
The same is true of testing. It took months to ramp up our testing capacity. The Omicronwe saw how vitaland with Omicron, we saw how vital it was and [that]* we have enough tests on hand to weather the surge. But without funding, we're not going to be able to sustain the testing capacity beyond the month of June. And if we fail to invest, we leave ourselves vulnerable if another wave of the virus hits.
Look, on vaccinesand most important tool in this fightwe're also running a risk. Yesterday the Food and Drug Administration, the FDA, and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC, authorized a fourth shot for those 50 years and older. We know boosters are critical to providing an additional level of protection. That's why I plan to get my second booster today right here after I'm done speaking.
If you haven't gotten your first booster, please don't wait. Do it today. Those who are 50 and older, as well as those who are immunocompromised, can now get itget even more protection than they have from the initial first doses. We have enough supply to give booster shots to those newly eligible individuals.
But if Congress fails to act, we won't have the supply we need this fall to ensure that shots are available, free, easily accessible for all Americans. Even worse, if we need a different vaccine for the future to combat a new variant, we're not going to have enough money to purchase it. We cannot allow that to happen.
Congress, we need to secure additional supply now. Now. We can't wait until we find ourselves in the midst of another surge to act. It will be too late.
And we also need this funding to continue our efforts to vaccinate the world, with commitments we made. It's critical to our ability to protect against new variants. There's no wall that you can build high enough to keep out a virus. Congress needs to act now, please.
Let me close with this: I've worked so hard to get our liveswe've worked so hard towe, all of us, have worked so hard to get our lives back.
We're summoning every ounce of American resilience; pulled every lever of our Government; called upon the goodness, decency, and patriotism of the American people; and together, we turned an unthinkable pain into an extraordinary progress and purpose. Americans are back to living their lives again. We can't surrender that now.
Congress, please act. You have to act immediately. The consequences of inaction are severe. They'll only grow with time, but it doesn't have to be that way.
We've proven what we can do when we work together. So I urge Democrats and Republicans to get this done with urgency. Let's stand united. Let's continue to pull together. Let's get this done.
Thank you, and God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.
And now I'm going to get my second booster shot.

I'm not sure why I'm doing it on stage. Just to prove I'm getting it, I guess.

2022-03-29 00:00:00,Remarks on Signing the Emmett Till Antilynching Act,"
[The President signed the bill.]
The President. All right. It's the law.
[At this point, the President greeted participants on the dais, then moved to the podium.]
The President. Thank you. It's a little unusual to do the bill signing, not say anything, and then speak, but that's how we set it up.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon.
Audience members. Good afternoon.
The President. I just signed into law the Emmett Till Antilynching Act, making lynching a Federal hate crime for the first time in American history. I want to thank Vice President Harris who was a key cosponsor of this bill when she was a United States Senator.
And I also want to thank Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer and Members of the Congress here today, especially Congressmen Hoyer and Bobby Rush, Senator Dick Durbin and Cory Booker. I also want to thank Senator Tim Scott, who couldn't be here today.
And the civil rights leaders gathered here today and, most of all, the family of Emmett Till and Ida B. Wells: Thank you for never giving up. Never, ever giving up. Matter of fact, granddaughter [great-granddaughter]* told me that her mother was herewhen?
Michelle Duster, great-granddaughter of journalist, civil rights leader, and antilynching activist Ida B. Wells-Barnett. [Inaudible]
The President. I mean, your grandmother [great-grandmother]* was here, when?
Ms. Duster. It was in 1898.
The President. In 1898, in order to make a case for the antilynching law. It was over 100 years ago, in 1900, when a North Carolina Representative named George Henry Whitethe son of a slave; the only Black lawmaker in Congress at the timewho first introduced legislation to make lynching a Federal crime. Hundredshundredsof similar bills have failed to pass.
Over the years, several Federal hate crime laws were enacted, including one I signed last year to combat COVID-19 hate crimes. But no Federal lawno Federal lawexpressly prohibited lynching. None. Until today.
One of the leading chronicles of our history of lynching is Bryan Stevenson, who happens to be a Delawarean from my home State, who wanted very much to be here today, but he could not. He helped build the National Memorial for Peace and Justice in Montgomery, Alabama, America's first site dedicated to understanding the legacy of lynching.
You know, his extensive research showed that between 1877 and 1950, more than 4,400 Black people were murdered by lynching, most in the South, but some in the North as well. That's a lot of folks, man, and a lot of silence for a long time.
Lynching was pure terror to enforce the lie that not everyonenot everyonebelongs in America and not everyone is created equal; terror to systematically undermine hard-fought civil rights; terror not just in the dark of the night but in broad daylight. Innocent men, women, and children hung by nooses from trees. Bodies burned and drowned and castrated.
Their crimes? Trying to vote. Trying to go to school. To try and own a business or preach the Gospel. False accusations of murder, arson, and robbery. Simply being Black. Often the crowds of White families gathered to celebrate the spectacle, taking pictures of the bodies and mailing them as postcards.
Emmett Till was an only child. He grew up on the South Side of Chicago with his mother Mamie, and grandparents and cousins. In the summer of 1955, Emmett turned 14 years old, ready to start eighth grade in the fall. Before school started, he wanted to visit his cousins in Mississippi.
So Emmett's mom dropped him off at the train station in Chicago. Her own family fled the Delta decades earlier, so she told himshe told himthe unwritten rules he had to follow. Quote: ""Be very careful how you speak. Say, 'Yes, sir,' and, 'No, ma'am,' and do not hesitate to beto humble yourself if you have to get down on your knees."" End of quote.
That same speech, that same admonition, too many Black parents today still have to use that admonition. They have to tell their children when it comes to encounters with the law enforcement. You know, and so many other circumstances.
She kissed Emmett goodbye. It was the last time she saw her son alive. Days after he arrived in Mississippi, Emmett's mutilated body was found in a river, barbed wire tied around his neck and a 75-pound cotton gin fan attached to that wire as he was thrown into the river. Emmett's motherhis motherdemanded that her son be sent home so that his funeral in Chicago could be an open casket. Here's what she said: ""Let the people see what I've seen."" America and the world saw what she saw.
Emmett Till was born nearly 40 years ago after the first antilynching law was introduced. Although he was one of thousands who were lynched, his mother couragehis mother's courage to show the world what was done to him energized the civil rights movement.
Exactly 100 days later, Rosa Parks was arrested on the bus in Montgomery. Her statue sits in my office. She said, ""I thought of Emmett Till, and I couldn't go back."" I thought of Emmett Till, and I couldn't go back. Dr. King often preached about, quote, ""the crying voices of little Emmett Till, screaming from the rushes of the Mississippi.""
To the Till family: We remain in awe of your courage to find purpose through your pain. To find purpose to through your pain. But the law is not just about the past, it's about the present and our future as well.
From the bullets in the back of Ahmaud Arbery to countless other acts of violencecountless victims known and unknownthe same racial hatred that drove the mob to hang a noose brought that mob carrying torches out of the fields of Charlottesville just a few years go.
Racial hate isn't an old problem, it's a persistent problema persistent problem. And I know many of the civil rights leaders here know, and you heard me say it a hundred times: Hate never goes away; it only hides. It hides under the rocks. And, given just a little bit of oxygen, it comes roaring back out, screaming. But what stops it is all of us, not a few. All of us have to stop it.
People like Ida B. Wells, one of the founders of the NAACP, established a hundred years ago in response to racial terror across the country. A brilliant, gifted writer, she exposed the barbaric nature of lynching as a tool to intimidate and subjugate Black Americans.
And her words, her courage, her convictionsshe was trying to prevent the murders of Emmett Till and Ahmaud Arbery and so many othersover 4,400 others. Ida B. Wells once said, quote, ""The way to right wrongs is to turn the light of truth upon the wrongs."" Turn the light of truth upon the wrongs.
That's what all of you have done, gathered in this Rose Garden, with this bill and so much more, including Ida B. Wells's great-granddaughter, Michelle Duster, whom I'm honored to introduce to mark this historic day.
Michelle, welcome to the White House, and welcome to the podium. And as my mother would say: God love you, dear.

2022-03-29 00:00:00,The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong of Singapore,"
President Biden. Welcome back to the White House. I'm honored to welcome Prime Minister Lee to the White House today. And I'm proudand I mean this sincerelyI'm really proud of the partnership thatbetween Singapore and the United States. It's as close and as strong as it's ever been. And together, we're working to uphold a rules-based orderinternational order, supporting the founding principles of the United Nationsand advance a future for the Indo-Pacific that is both free and open.
As we look toward the future, Prime Minister Lee and I share a commitment to ASEAN asand its centrality in all of what we do. And I'm looking forward to hosting the ASEAN leaders here in Washington, DC, for a special summit this spring.
We also discussed a wide range of concerns for peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific. That includes ensuring that all nations in the region, including China, uphold the principles that enable a free and open region. Singapore and the United States are both committed to freedom of navigation as well as the unimpeded flow of maritime commerce in the South China Sea.
We shared our concerns about the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and their destabilizing ballistic missile launches and in clear violationwhich are clearly in violation of multiple U.N. Council resolutionsSecurity Council resolutions. And we both urge North Korea to refrain from further provocations and return to the negotiation table for serious and sustained diplomacy.
We're deeply concerned, both of us, by the continuing suffering and violence in Burma, following last year's military coup, the coup that caused humanitarian crisis and reversed a decade of democratic and economic progress for the people of Burma. Singapore and the United States agree that the military regime must urgently implement the ASEAN five-point consensus and return Burma to its path to democratic transition.
And we also discussed the war in Ukraine. Last week, in Europe, the world saw the strong unity for a unified response and resolve among the NATO alliance, the G-7, and the European Union to answer Putin's brutal and unjustified assault on Ukraine.
Today, with the Prime Minister's visit and Singapore's strong leadership on this issue, it's clear that Putin's war is unacceptable to nations in every region of the worldnot just Europe, but in every region of the world. It's an attack on the core international principles, and itthat underpin peace and security and prosperity everywhere, including in the Indo-Pacific.
Today, Singapore and the United States are united in sending the message to all nationsto all nations, regardless of their size or population: They are equal in the rightin their rights on the global stage. They have a right to sovereignty and territorial integrity and to determine their own future free from violence and intimidation.
Mr. Prime Minister, our nations cooperate closely on security and counterterrorism; we have for some time. And we have deep commercial and economic ties. We've also developed deep personal ties as well, I must acknowledge.
And Iwe're going to continue to deepen our partnership and seize the opportunities to meet the challenges of the moment and to meet them together: fighting COVID-19, making sure we're prepared for the next pandemic; increasing our climate ambitions and working to decarbonize the shipping sector; cooperating on everything from cybersecurity to space exploration; promoting a broad-based economic growth throughout the Indo-Pacific, including by working together to develop an Indo-Pacific economic framework that will drive enduring prosperity across the region.
So we have a large agenda, Mr. Prime Ministeran important agenda, a shared vision that we are jointly pursuing: a free and open Indo-Pacific, an Indo-Pacific that is connected, prosperous, and more secure, and more resilient. And the U.S.-Singapore partnership is essential, I believe, to realize that future.
So thank you again, Prime Minister Lee. I always appreciate consulting with you. And as I've told you, both you and Singapore punch way above your weightway above your weight. And I value the time we spend together, and I look forward to many more meetings.
The floor is yours.
Prime Minister Lee. Thank you, President Biden. Thank you for those warm remarks.
President Biden, ladies and gentlemen: I'd like to thank the President for the very warm welcome that I and my delegation have received.
We last met in Rome on the sidelines of the G-20 summit, but much has changed since those few months ago. Current international uncertainties and crisis underscore the need for countries to work together with close friends and partners. And Singapore deeply appreciates theAmerica's commitment to engage Southeast Asia, and especially Singapore, despite the ongoing crisis in Ukraine.
We had a very good discussion with President Biden this morning. We reaffirmed the longstanding and multifaceted partnership between Singapore and the U.S. and our shared commitment to a stable, rules-based global order.
The U.S. has played an important and constructive role in the Asia-Pacific for more thanfor nearly 80 years. And Singapore has consistently supported a strong U.S. presence in the region through our words and actions.
We have substantial bilateral cooperation on economic, defense, and security issues, and also strong people-to-people ties. Singapore is the second largest Asian investor in the U.S., and the U.S. is the largest investor in Singapore. Singapore's investments in the U.S. and U.S. exports to Singapore support over a quarter million American jobs.
On the defense front, Singapore is a major security cooperation partner of the U.S., in fact, the only country with this status. For more than 30 years, we've had an MOU on defense cooperation, signed in 1990 and recently renewed in 2019, which has provided the U.S. military access to Singapore's air and naval bases.
We are also expanding our cooperation into new areas, including cybersecurity, digital economy, sustainable development, and even space.
Singapore deeply appreciates President Biden's leadership in strengthening U.S. engagement in the region. We welcome his intention to host an ASEAN-U.S. special summit here soon. It's a strong affirmation of American commitment to Southeast Asia and to ASEAN centrality.
The President and I discussed the importance of the U.S. growing both its strategic and economic stakes in the Asia-Pacific. It's important to advance a positive economic agenda that's open, inclusive, up to date, and flexible. We therefore welcome America's proposed Indo-Pacific economic framework, which will strengthen America's engagement in the evolving regional economic architecture.
I discussed with the President his recent visit to Europe and the ongoing crisis in Ukraine. Singapore is a staunch supporter of international law and the U.N. Charter, which prohibits acts of aggression against a sovereign state. And that's why we have strongly condemned the unprovoked attack by Russia on Ukraine.
The sovereignty, political independence, and territorial integrity of all countries, big and small, must be respected. The unprovoked military invasion of a sovereign country under any pretext is unacceptable. We cannot condone any country arguing that another country's independence is the result of historical errors and crazy decisions.
I shared with President Biden the measures that Singapore has taken to constrain Russia's capacity to conduct war against Ukraine. Our actions are based on principles that are fundamental to our survival and existence as an independent, sovereign nation. We've upheld these principles and voted in accordance with them at the U.N. in successive crisis over many decades involving different countries.
The war in the Ukraine has implications for the Asia-Pacific. There are potential flashpoints and contentious issues in our region too, which, if not managed well, could escalate to open conflict. Countries with interests in the region need to pursue all efforts to settle disagreements through peaceful means so that we can avoid reaching a point of no return.
It's important, therefore, to keep open channels of dialogue between countries, including at the highest level. This will help to manage developments in order to avoid conflict and prevent misreading each other's intentions.
We also need to create inclusive constructs to bridge differences and encourage cooperation and interdependence in the Asia-Pacific, for example, the APEC leaders' meeting and the proposed Indo-Pacific economic framework.
The U.S. has enduring strategic interests in the Asia-Pacific and many friends in the region who want you to stay actively and consistently engaged. And I'm confident that within this regional context, Singapore's own relationship with the U.S. will continue to grow from strength to strength.
Thank you very much.
President Biden. Thank you. Now, we each agreed we would take one question. AndI'llas I'll recognize someone first.
Darlene Superville, Associated Press.
Russia/Ukraine 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. What is your view of Russia's announcement today that it will, quote, ""fundamentally"" scale back its military operations near Kyiv and another northern city in Ukraine? Do you see this as possibly the war beginning to come to an end, or do you see this as Russia trying to buy time and to recalibrate for a new military effort?
President Biden. We'll see. I don't read anything into it until I see what their actions are. We'll see if they follow through on what they're suggesting. There are negotiations that have begun todayor not begun, continued; today: one in Turkey and others.
I had a meeting with the heads of state of four allies in NATO: France, Germany, the United States, and Great Britain. And there seems to be a consensus that let's just see what they have to offer; we'll find out what they do. But in the meantime, we're going to continue to keep strong the sanctions. We're going to continue to provide the Ukrainian military with their capacity to defend themselves. And we're going to continue to keep a close eye on what's going on.
Thank you.
Prime Minister Lee. I call on Dawn Tan, Channel NewsAsia.
Q. Good afternoon, Mr. President. Good afternoon
Prime Minister Lee. Use the mike.
Q. Oh. Good afternoon, Mr. President. And good afternoon, Prime Minister.
Prime Minister, you've advocated the benefits for the United States to develop a bipartisan consensus on Asia, that Asia depends upon a predictable U.S. policy towards the region.
How assured are you, though, that the momentum that you've seen with ASEAN-U.S. engagement has the ability to move the needle on shared objectives in the Asia-Pacific towards the fundamentals that we all need to live by: peace, prosperity, and economic development? And basically, how well is President Biden doing in this regard? [Laughter]
Prime Minister Lee. I think if you put it at a very broad level, there is consensus in the United States on the direction of their policy in the Asia-Pacific: that they want to engage China; that they are developingtrying to develop a stable, predictable relationship with China; and, at the same time, engaging other countries in the region not just on strategic and security issues, but also on economic cooperation and trade and other investment and environmental and sustainability links.
So, at the very broad level, I think the consensus is there. At the level of specific policies, each administration launches new initiatives. I'm quite convinced, having seen several administrations, that this one is completely focused on achieving something lasting in Asia. And we in Singapore will do our best to help to make sure that their proposals work and will take root and will continue to grow for many years to come.
President Biden. Thank you.
Prime Minister Lee. Thank you, President Biden.
President Biden. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Thank you.
Prime Minister Lee. Thank you.
President Biden. Thank you, gentlemen.

2022-03-29 00:00:00,Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong of Singapore,"
President Biden. Well, Prime Minister, it's great to have you back. We've
Prime Minister Lee. Happy to be here.
President Biden. spent a fair amount of time together.
This is a critical moment for, I think, both our countries and the region that you so ably represent.
And the strength of the U.S.it seems to me, at least; I hope you think the same waythe Singapore Strategic Partnership to support peace and prosperity throughout the Pacific these many years: Today, that partnership is as important as it's ever been, in my opinion. As a matter of a fact, I think it's growing in importance.
And a rule-based order is facing unprecedented challenges. Russia's unprovoked and unjustifiable war against Ukraine is an urgent threat to both Europe and, I believe, to the Indo-Pacific as well. And it's attacking the core tenets of a rule-based international order. And the borders can't be changed by force. And all the nations, large and small, are equal and sovereignin rights for their sovereignty.
And I want to thank you, Mr. Prime Minister, for Singapore's principled leadership in supporting the people of Ukraine. I know it's not easy, but I want to thank you for it. You're a man of principle, and you've stepped up every time you've had to.
And even as we address the crisis in Europe, my administration is strongly supportive of moving rapidly to implement the Indo-Pacific strategy that we've talked about, as you know.
And the United States is a proud Indo-Pacific nation. It's hard for most other nations of the world to understand that, but we have a big country and a lot of Pacific territory. [Laughter] And Iit's a free and open area that we want to make sure iswe want to maintain it that way and connect it in purpose and security and in terms of our resilience.
And so, today, at the end of the day, we're going to discuss a number of important issues: the U.S.-ASEAN relationship, upholding freedom of the seas, promoting return of democracy in Burma, and advancing an inclusive and sustainable economic growth in both our areas.
And so I want to thank you, again, for making this journey. And, Mr. Prime Minister, the floor is yours, good friend.
Prime Minister Lee. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, especially, for receiving me at this critical moment in world affairs. And I'm sure you're completely seized with what's happening in Europe right now. But we doubly appreciate the time you are giving to the relationship with Singapore and with Southeast Asian countries generally, especially ASEAN.
Singapore is a very good partner of the United States. We are a major security cooperation partner of the U.S. And our relations are doing very well economically, as well as in the security and defense realms, and they prosper and grow and venture into new areas continuously.
And I hope to discuss that with the President today, as well as to further the relationship between the U.S. and ASEAN, which is an engagement which is important to the U.S. because it helps the U.S. to be present in the Asia-Pacific and to deepen its relations with many friends and to strengthen its strategic interests in the region.
We will, of course, exchange views also on Ukraine and what that means for the Asia-Pacific region.
Singapore hopes that the United States, amidst all its many preoccupations, will continue to deepen its relationship with countries in the Asia-PacificChina, certainly, but also other countries besides Chinaand deepen it substantially in many different ways through the Indo-Pacific strategy and, in doing so, to foster the peace, stability, and security of the region, as you have done for so many decades since the war.
Thank you very much.
President Biden. I assure you that's our objective. I assure you.
Prime Minister Lee. Thank you.
President Biden. Thank you all.

"
2022-03-28 00:00:00,Remarks on the Fiscal Year 2023 Budget and an Exchange With Reporters,"
The President. Thank you. Well, good afternoon, folks. It's been a busy couple of days for all of you.
Thelet me begin by saying thatthanking Director Young.
You know, you've heard me say this before over the years: My dad had an expression. He said: ""Don't tell me what you value. Show me your budget, and I'll tell you what you value."" Don't tell me what you value. Show me your budget, and I'll tell you what you value.
Well, the budget I'm releasing today sends a clear message to the American people that wewhat we value. First, fiscal responsibility. Second, safety and security. And thirdly, the
[At this point, the President cleared his throat.]
Excuse methe investments needed to build a better America.
The first value is fiscal responsibility. The previous administration, as you all know, ran up record budget deficits. In fact, the deficit went up every year under my predecessor. My administration is turning that around.
Last year, we cut the deficit by more than $350 billion. This year, we're on track to cut the deficit by more than 1 trillion 300 billion dollars1 trillion 300 billion dollars. That would be the largest 1-year reduction in the deficit in U.S. history.
And here's how we're achieving itthis record deficit reduction: First, we're growing the economy. We have created a record 6.7 million jobs since I took office. And we have generated a GDP growth of 5.7 percent, the best economic growth we've seen in this country in over 40 years. This has led to a substantial increase in Government revenues and dramatically improved our fiscal situation.
Secondly, this record economic and job growth has made it possible for us to responsibly and significantly cut back on emergency spending.
Early in the pandemic, it was right to give people help to make ends meet and to keep theirthis economy going. But because of the progress we've made dealing with these emergencies, the labor market is strong, and unemployment claims are at historic lows. We ended the pandemic unemployment assistance programs because Americans are back to work. I'm calling for new pandemic subsidies for large businessesto not continue those because those businesses are back and moving again as well.
But because we have put this economy on a strong foundation, even the Delta and Omicron variants of COVID-19 and the cost of Putin's aggression in Ukraine have not required additionalan additional fiscal package for State and local governments. But we still spend what we need to spend to continue to fight COVID. But those expenditures will be dramatically less than last year.
Compared to 2020, we're reducing the size of the deficit relative to our economy by almost two-thirds, reducing inflationary pressures and making real headway cleaning up the fiscal mess I inherited. After my President'smyexcuse memy predecessor's fiscal mismanagement, we're reducing the Trump deficits and returning our fiscal house to order.
Now, the budget I'm releasing today will continue this approach. It makes prudent investments in economic growth, a more equitable economy, while making sure corporations and the wealthy pay their fair share. And, I would add, nobody making less than $400,000 a year will pay a penny more in Federal taxes.
We can do this by, one, passing legislation that lowers costs for families on things like childcare, health care, and energy costs while lowering our deficit at the same time. We can give hard-working parents raising children tax relief that gives them just a bit of breathing room and lowers child poverty.
We can give Medicare the power to negotiate lower prescription drug prices. This will bring down the cost for seniors and reduce the deficit by hundreds of billions of dollars. Congress can do thatthis all right now. They're debating it now.
We can also restore fiscal responsibility. The Trump tax cuts added $2 trillion in deficit spending and largely helped the rich and the largest corporations. Under my plan, as I said, no one making less than $400,000 a year will pay an additional single penny in taxes. No one. If you don't make 400 grand, you're not going to pay a single penny in additional Federal taxes.
And the wealthy and corporations will finally begin to pay their fair share. For most Americans, the last few years were very hard, stretching them to the breaking point. But billionaires and large corporations got richer than ever. Right now billionaires pay an average rate of 8 percent on their total income. Eight percent, that's the average they pay.
Now, I'm a capitalist, but justI wantif you make a billion bucks, great. Just pay your fair share. Pay a little bit. A firefighter and a teacher pay more than doubledoublethe tax rate that a billionaire pays. That's not right. That's not fair. And my budget contains a ""billionaire minimum tax"" because of that, a 20-percent minimum tax that applies only to the top one-hundredth of 1 percent. One-hundredth of 1 percent of the Americans will pay this tax.
The billionaire minimum tax is fair, and it raises $360 billion that can be used to lower costs for families and cut the deficit.
As I said, my budget also ensures that corporations pay their fair share. In 2020, there were 50 Fortune 500 companies that made $40 billion in profit combined, but didn't pay a single, solitary cent in Federal taxes. My budget raises the corporate tax rate to 28 percent, far lower than the rate it was between World War II and 2017, when it was loweredas of today.
Last year, I rallied more than a hundred andsome of you were overseas with me130 countries to agree to a global minimum tax for corporations doing business in their countries; to put an end to a tax system that rewards multinational corporations for shipping the jobs and profits overseas, and avoiding taxes at home.
It's my hope that Congress enacts this law this year so I can sign it and we can get to work.
The second value my budget reflects is security: security at home and security abroad. My budget tackles security in two keys ways.
First, it secures our communities at home. This is an issue families in every part of the country face. I've said it before: The answer is not to defund our police departments, it's to fund our police and give them all the tools they need, training, and foundation, and partners and protectors in ourthat our communities need.
The budget puts more police on the street for community policing so they get to know the community they're policing; allows the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms and the FBI to hire the agents they need to help fight gun crime and other violent crimes in our communities; and funds body cameras and makes sure police work with our local communities and are accountable to these communities.
It funds crime prevention and community violence intervention, drug treatment, mental health, criminal justice reform, and reentry for people coming home after incarceration. All demonstrable ways to reduce crimeand proven ways.
Security also means national and international security. This budget provides the resources we need to keep Americans safe, ensuring that our military remains the best prepared, best trained, best equipped military in the world.
This budget also provides additional funding to forcefully respond to Putin's aggression against Ukraine and its economic, humanitarian, and security consequences.
The world has changed. In addition to dealing with terrorist organizations, for the second quarter of the 21st century, we're once again facing increased competition from other nation-statesChina and Russiawhich are going to require investments to make things like space and cyber and other advanced capabilities, including hypersonics.
And this will be among the largest investments in our national security in history. Some people don't like the increase, but we're in a different world today. America is more prosperous, more successful, and more just when it is more secure. We can restore fiscal responsibility and safeguard our security at home and abroad while meeting a third value, what I call ""building a better America.""
Let's provide universal preschool, cap the cost of childcare at 7 percent of a family's income. Like many families, that would cut the cost of childcare in half. Let's makeand it will make college more affordable. My budget doubles the maximum Pell grant to families making under $50,000 a year to nearly $13,000. And it helps more than 8 million students who rely on Pell grants pay for college.
My budget invests in building more homes to keep us upto deal with the skyrocketing cost of housing for the middle class and the poor. My budget lowers family energy costs with tax credits to help people make their homes more efficient, research and development to broaden the reach of solar and build a clean energy future.
My budget also invests in other areas of bipartisan common goodI call them ""unity agendas;"" I spoke to them at the State of the Unionbeating the opioid epidemic, taking on challenges of mental health, supporting our veterans, and ending cancer as we know it.
This budget includes investments to get Americans the mental health services they need, and we need them. And when it comes to fighting cancer and other diseases, my budget funds a new organization called ARPA-H at the Health and Human Servicesat the Department of Health. And it stands for Advanced Research Projects [Agency]* for Health.
It's based on DARPA, the Defense Department program that led to breakthrough technologies like the internet, GPS, and so much more. ARPA-H will drive breakthroughs to prevent, detect, and treat diseases, including Alzheimer's, diabetes, cancers, and more.
And here's what this all adds up to: historic deficit reduction, historic investment in our security at home and abroad by modernizing our capabilities in both areas, and an unprecedented commitment to building an economy where everyone has a chance to succeeda plan to pay for those investments that we need as a nation. That's what we do.
So I look forward to working with Members of CongressDemocrats, Republicans, and Independentsto deliver this budget and keep delivering for the American people.
I want to thank you all. And may God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.
Q. Mr. President
The President. Let meKelly O'Donnell, NBC [NBC News].
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Do you believe what you said
[At this point, a microphone was handed to Ms. O'Donnell]
Q. thank you, sir.
President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin of Russia/Ukraine 
Q. Do you believe what you saidthat Putin can't remain in power? Or do you now regret saying that? Because your Government has been trying to walk that back. Did your words complicate matters?
The President. Well, you asked three different questions, and I'll answer them all.
Number one, I'm not walking anything back. The fact of the matter is I was expressing the moral outrage I felt toward the way Putin is dealing, and the actions of this manjust the brutality of it. Half the children in Ukraine. I had just come from being with those families.
And sobut I want to make it clear: I wasn't then, nor am I now, articulating a policy change. I was expressing the moral outrage that I feel, and I make no apologies for it.
Q. Your personal feelings? Your personal feelings?
The President. Personal. My personal feelings.
Secondly, you asked me aboutwhat was the second part?
Q. Does it complicate the diplomacy of this moment?
The President. No, I don't think it does. You know, the fact is that we're in a situation wherewhat complicates the situation at the moment is the escalatory efforts of Putin to continue to engage in carnagethe kind of behavior that makes the whole world say, ""My God, what is this man doing?"" That's what complicates things a great deal.
Andbut I don't think it complicates it at all.
Q. Mr. President
The President. Let me go to Steve Holland, Reuters.
President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin of Russia 
Q. Mr. President, thank you. When you say that you're not walking anything back, you do feel that Vladimir Putin should be remained fromremoved from power. Is that what you're saying? And
The President. No, what I wasI was expressing just what I said. I was expressing the moral outrage I felt towards this man. I wasn't articulating a policy change.
And I think that, you know, if he continues on this course that he's on, he is going to become a pariah worldwide. And who knows what he'd comebecomes at home, in terms of support.
Q. Just to follow up, are you concerned this remark might escalate the conflict?
The President. No, I'm not. I'm not at all.
Q. [Inaudible]
The President. Lookyou know, look, the other thing is that a couple people have asked me, as wellmight as well speak to it, unless you want to ask the questionbut you know, that other governments have suggested that this is a problem, I'm escalating things. No. And it has weakened NATO? No, it hasn't. NATO has never ever, ever, ever, ever, ever been as strong as it is today. Never.
President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin of Russia/North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
Q. So, if saying he cannot remain in power does not mean regime change, what does it mean in your view?
The President. It means that I would hopeI just was expressing my outrage. He shouldn't remain in power. Just like, you know, bad people shouldn't continue to do bad things.
But it doesn't mean we have a fundamental policy to do anything to take Putin down in any way.
Q. What made you add that? Because that wasn't in your prepared remarks, we were told. So what made you add that at the end, Mr. President?
The President. Because I was talking aboutI was talking to the Russian people. The last part of the speech was talking to the Russian people, telling them what we thought. And I was communicating this to not only the Russian people, but the whole world.
This is just stating a simple fact that this kind of behavior is totally unacceptabletotally unacceptableand the way to deal with it is to strengthen and putkeep NATO completely united and to help Ukraine where we can.
Cleve [Cleve R. Wootson, Jr., Washington Post], you had a question? Where is he?
Fiscal Year 2023 Budget/Policing Best Practices/Community Violence Intervention Programs 
Q. Thanks, Mr. President. On youron your budget, you've said repeatedly at the State of the Union that you are not for defunding the police. I do wonder how much emphasis you think should be put on alternative forms of crime prevention, not just defunding the police, but you know, crime reduction in communities.
The President. Oh, a significant amount. I've laid that out in detail in the budget.
For example, we do know that intervention programs work. We do know that what police need, they need psychologists in the department as much as they need extra rifles. They need people who are in the department who can deal with the crisis that the police are going through as welldealing with their crises, dealing with their mental state and how they're handling things. They need outthey need social workers engaged with them. I lay it all out.
There's aand it all works. If you see these community intervention programs, they work. They actually reduce crime. They significantly reduce crime. So that's a big piece of it.
Q. Just a follow-up. Is anyis any of it related to political pressure from Republicans saying that Democrats are soft on crime; thatyou know, that you guys are careening to the left?
The President. Isn't it kind of fascinating? When I first got elected, I was being beat up because I supported the police too much for the previous 30 years. No. It's what I think.
And, Asma [Asma Khalid, NPR].
President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin of Russia/North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
Q. Yes, hi. Surprised to hear my name called. [Laughter] Thank you, Mr. President. Are youare you willing to try to meet with Vladimir Putin? And I have a quick follow-up to that.
When you last met with him face-to-fact in Geneva, you described that as a productive conversation; you said that he did not want a cold war. And do you feelgiven the actions, though, that have happened over the last few months, I guess I'm asking: What has changed, in his mind?
The President. I don't know if it's changed his mind. His behavior has changed. When we met, remember what we were talking about. We were talking about setting up a strategic dialogue and talking about the relationship of NATO and Russia and facing off in the regions and how we could have more transparency and all the rest. It was a normal discussion I had, going all the way back to Kosygin and others, back ina hundred years ago, when I was a young Senator.
And so what changed wasnothing remotely approaching that.
Remember when he first met with me, he said, ""I have two objectives."" This is the second or third time I met with him. He said, ""I have two objectives."" One is to make sure that they never become part of NATO. And two, to make sure there are no long-range missiles in therein Ukraine.
I said, ""We can deal with the second one easily, but we can't close the door on the first."" Because when we talk about missiles, we want to talk about what's also on the Russian border heading towards Europe. Do both.
And then, if you noticed, that demand list of hisnot with me, with othershave escalated significantly in terms of what he thinks is necessary.
Thank you very
[Several reporters began speaking at once.]
The President. I'm going to take another one.
Q. We need some more clarification, sir.
Q. Mr. President, thank you. Thank you very much.
The President. I know you're going to ask a really nice question.
Q. Well, it's an important question, I think.
The President. No, I'm kidding.
The President's Visit With U.S. Servicemembers in Jasionka, Poland 
Q. Are you worried that other leaders in the world are going to start to doubt that America is back if some of these big things that you say on the world stage keep getting walked back?
The President. They'rewhat's getting walked back?
Q. Itmade it sound like, just in the last couple of daysit sounded like you told U.S. troops they were going to Ukraine. It sounded like you said it was possible the U.S. would use a chemical weapon. And it sounded like you were calling for regime change in Russia. And we know
The President. None of the three occurred.
Q. None of the three occurred?
The President. None of the three.
Q. Mr. President
The President. You interpret the language that way. I was talking to the troops. We were talking about helping train the troops inthat arethe Ukrainian troops that are in Poland. That's what the contextI sat there with those guys for a couple hours. That's what we talked about.
Chemical Weapons 
Q. So when you said, ""You're going to see when you're there,"" you were not intending to send U.S.[inaudible]?
The President. I was referring to withbeing with and talking with the Ukrainian troops who are in Poland.
Q. And when you said a chemical weapon use by Russia would ""trigger a response in kind""?
The President. It will trigger a significant response[inaudible].
Q. What does that mean?
The President. I'm not going to tell you. Why would I tell you? You've got to be silly.
Q. The world wants to know.
The President. The world wants to know a lot of things. I'm not telling them what the response would be; then Russia knows the response.
Q. Mr. President, you said
Q. Mr. President
The President. All right, I'm going to take two more questions. One, two.
President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin of Russia 
Q. Mr. President, thank you. I still want to get back to your original words that he cannot remain in power. Can you help us understand: You have more foreign policy experience than any President who has ever held this office. Whether those are your personal feelings or your feelings as President, do you understand why people would believe you, as someone commanding one of the largest nuclear arsenals in the world, saying someone cannot remain in power is a statement of U.S. policy?
And also, are you concerned about propaganda use of those remarks by the Russians?
The President. No and no.
Q. No? Tell me why. You have so much experience. You are the leader of this country.
The President. Because it's ridiculous. Nobody believes we're going to take downI was going toI was talking about taking down Putin. Nobody who believes that. Number one.
Number two, what have I been talking about allsince this all began? The only war that's worse than one intended is one that's unintended. The last thing I want to do is engage in a land war or a nuclear war with Russia. That's not part of it.
I was expressing my outrage at the behavior of this man. It's outrageous. It's outrageous. And it's more an aspiration than anything. He shouldn't be in power.
There's noI mean, people like this shouldn't be ruling countries, but they do. The fact they dobut it doesn't mean I can't express my outrage about it.
Last question.
President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin of Russia 
Q. Mr. President, thank you. You've said that you're confident that your comment won't undermine diplomatic efforts, but just to be clear, are you confident that Vladimir Putin sees it that waythat he will not use this as an escalatory
The President. I don't care what he thinks.
Look, here's the deal: He's going to do what he's going to do. Putinlook
Q. But you're not concerned that he may see your language and view that as a sign of a reason for escalationuse that as an excuse to escalate, given
The President. No.
Q. his recent behavior?
The President. Given his recent behavior, you shouldexcuse me, I shouldn't say that to yougiven his recent behavior, people should understand that he is going to do what he thinks he should do. Period. He's not affected by anybody else, including, unfortunately, apparently his own advisers.
This is a guy who goes to the beat of his own drummer. And the idea that he is going to do something outrageous because I called him for what he was and what he's doing, I think is just not rational.
President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin of Russia/Ukraine 
Q. You didn't say whether you'd meet him again. Would you meet with President Putin ever again?
The President. No. Itno, it's not a question ofthe question is: Is there something to meet on that would justify him being able to end this war and be able to rebuild Ukraine. That's the issue.
Q. So there is a chance you would meet with him?
Q. Can I ask you about the Supreme Court
The President. Sure.
Q. sir?
Q. Are youcan you just say
Q. Real quick, on the Supreme Court?
Q. Sorry, can you just say yes or no, Mr. President, whether or not you would be willing to meet with President Putin again?
The President. It depends on what he wants to talk about.
Q. Thank you.
White House aide. Okay. Last question.
Q. What if he wanted to talk about negotiations though? What if he wanted to
The President. Now, look, you said Supreme Court. [Laughter] Now, don't play games, okay?
Congressional Investigation of the January 6, 2021, Attack on the U.S. Capitol/Department of Justice 
Q. Well, you can't leave that hanging. [Laughter]
Just real quicktwo matters on the Supreme Court. Therewhile you were away, there were reports about the wife of Justice Thomas and texts that she had with former White House Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows. Should Justice Thomas recuse himself from any cases involving the January 6 insurrection or former President Trump at this point?
The President. I'd leave that to two entities.
Q. And onokay, go ahead.
The President. No, go ahead. Ask your second question.
Q. No, two entities. Go ahead. Sorry. [Laughter]
The President. One, the January 6 committee and, two, the Justice Department. That's their judgment, not mine to make.
Q. So, on Justice Thomas recusing, you don't think he should? Or
The President. I'm notI said thatI told you: Those things get into legal issues; that, in fact, I told you I would not tell the Justice Department what position to take or not take. And I'm not going to instruct the Congress either.
Supreme Court Nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson 
Q. And did you get any chance to watch much of the Judiciary Committee hearings last night?
The President. I didn't get a chance to see any of it, unfortunately.
Q. The fact that Republicans were questioning Judge Jackson on matters like former sentences related to child pornography cases or the definition of a ""woman""does that, as the former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, make sense to you?
The President. Look, this is one of the most qualified nominees ever nominated for the Supreme Court in every respectin terms of her disposition, her intellectual capacity, her experience and background, and serving on twothree additional courts. A woman who is totally, thoroughly qualifiedtotally, thoroughly qualified, and will be a great addition to the Court, in my view.
Thank you.
Q. Mr. President
Q. Mr. President, do you think that Russia is behind the alleged poisoning of those Ukrainian peace negotiators?

2022-03-26 00:00:00,"Remarks on International Assistance Efforts for Ukraine in Warsaw, Poland","
Thank you, thank you, thank you. Please, if you have a seat, be seated. [Laughter] If you don't, come up on stage. Thank you very much. It's a great honor to be here. Mr. President, they tell me you're over there somewhere. There you are. Thank you, Mr. President. ""Be not afraid."" They were the first words at the first public address of the first Polish Pope after his election on October of 1978. They were words that would come to define Pope John Paul II, words that would change the world.
John Paul brought the message here to Warsaw in his first trip back home as Pope in June of 1979. It was a message about the power: the power of faith, the power of resilience, and the power of the people. In the face of a cruel and brutal system of government, it was a message that helped end the Soviet repression in the Central land and Eastern Europe 30 years ago. It was a message that will overcome the cruelty and brutality of this unjust war.
When Pope John Paul brought that message in 1979, the Soviet Union ruled with an iron fist behind an Iron Curtain. Then, a year later, the Solidarity movement took hold in Poland. And while I know he couldn't be here tonight, we're all grateful in America and around the world for Lech Walesa. It reminds me of that phrase of philosopher Kierkegaard: ""[F]aith sees best in the dark."" And they were dark moments.
Ten years later, the Soviet Union collapsed, and Poland and Central and Eastern Europe would soon be free. Nothing about that battle for freedom was simple or easy. It was a long, painful slog fought over not days and months, but years and decades. But we emerged anew in the great battle for freedom: a battle between democracy and autocracy, between liberty and repression, between a rules-based order and one governed by brute force. In this battle, we need to be clear eyed. This battle will not be won in days or months either. We need to steel ourselves for the long fight ahead.
Mr. President, Mr. Prime Minister, Mr. Mayor, Members of the Parliament, distinguished guests, and the people of Poland, and I suspect some people of Ukraine that are here: We are gathered here at the Royal Castle in this city that holds a sacred place in the history of not only of Europe, but humankind's unending search for freedom. For generations, Warsaw has stood where liberty has been challenged and liberty has prevailed. In fact, it was here in Warsaw when a young refugee, who fled her home country from Czechoslovakia was under Soviet domination, came back to speak and stand in solidarity with dissidents.
Her name was Madeleine Korbel Albright. She becameone of the most ardent supporters of democracy in the world. She was a friend with whom I served, America's first woman Secretary of State. She passed away 3 days ago. She fought her whole life for essential democratic principles. And now, in the perennial struggle for democracy and freedom, Ukraine and its people are on the frontlines fighting to save their nation. And their brave resistance is part of a larger fight for an essential democratic principles that unite all free people: the rule of law; fair and free elections; the freedom to speak, to write, and to assemble; the freedom to worship as one chooses; freedom of the press.
These principles are essential in a free society. But they have alwaysthey have alwaysbeen under siege. They've always been embattled. Every generation has had to defeat democracy's mortal foes. That's the way of the worldfor the world is imperfect, as we know. Where the appetites and ambitions of a few forever seek to dominate the lives and liberties of many. My message to the people of Ukraine is the message I delivered today to Ukraine's Foreign Minister and Defense Minister, who I believe are here tonight: We stand with you. Period.
Today's fighting in Kyiv and Mariupol and Kharkiv are the latest battle in a long struggle: Hungary, 1956; Poland, 1956 then again 1981; Czechoslovakia, 1968. Soviet tanks crushed democratic uprisings, but the resistance continued until finally, in 1989, the Berlin Wall and all of the walls of Soviet domination, they fell. They fell. And the people prevailed. But the battle for democracy could not conclude and did not conclude with the end of the cold war. Over the last 30 years, the forces of autocracy have revived all across the globe. Its hallmarks are familiar ones: contempt for the rule of law, contempt for democratic freedom, contempt for the truth itself.
Today, Russia has strangled democracyhas sought to do so elsewhere, not only in its homeland. Under false claims of ethnic solidarity, it has invalidated [invaded]* neighboring nations. Putin has the gall to say he's ""de-Nazifying"" Ukraine. It's a lie. It's just cynical. He knows that. And it's also obscene. President Zelenskyy was democratically elected. He's Jewish. His father's family was wiped out in the Nazi Holocaust. And Putin has the audacity, like all autocrats before him, to believe that might will make right.
In my own country, a former President named Abraham Lincoln voiced the opposing spirit to save our Union in the midst of a civil war. He said, ""Let us have faith that right makes might."" ""Right makes might."" Today, let us now have that faith again. Let us resolve to put the strength of democracies into action to thwart the designs of autocracy. Let us remember that the test of this moment is the test of all time.
The Kremlin wants to portray NATO enlargement as an imperial project aimed at destabilizing Russia. Nothing is further from the truth. NATO is a defensive alliance. It has never sought the demise of Russia. In the lead-up to the current crisis, the United States and NATO worked for months to engage Russia to avert a war. I met with him in person and talked to him many times on the phone.
Time and again, we offered real diplomacy and concrete proposals to strengthen European security, enhance transparency, and build confidence on all sides. But Putin and Russia met each of the proposals with disinterest in any negotiation, with lies and ultimatums. Russia was bent on violence from the start.
I know not all of you believed me and us when we kept saying: ""They are going to cross the border. They are going to attack."" Repeatedly, he asserted, ""We have no interest in war."" Guaranteed he would not move. Repeatedly saying he would not invade Ukraine. Repeatedly saying Russian troops along the border were there for ""training,"" all 180,000 of them.
There is simply no justification or provocation for Russia's choice of war. It's an example of one of the oldest of human impulses: using brute force and disinformation to satisfy a craving for absolute power and control. It's nothing less than a direct challenge to the rule-based international order established since the end of World War II. And it threatens to return to decades of war that ravaged Europe before the international rule-based order was put in place. We cannot go back to that. We cannot.
The gravity of the threat is why the response of the West has been so swift and so powerful and so unified, unprecedented, and overwhelming. Swift and punishing costs are the only things that are going to get Russia to change its course. Within days of its invasion, the West had moved jointly with sanctions to damage Russia's economy. Russia's Central Bank is now blocked from global financial systems, denying Kremlin's access to the war fund it stashed around the globe.
We've aimed at the heart of Russia's economy by stopping the imports of Russian energy to the United States. To date, the United States has sanctioned 140 Russian oligarchs and their family members, seizing their ill-begotten gains: their yachts, their luxury apartments, their mansions. We've sanctioned more than 400 Russian Government officials, including key architects of this war. These officials and oligarchs have reaped enormous benefit from the corruption connected to the Kremlin, and now they have to share in the pain.
The private sector is acting as well. Over 400 private multinational companies have pulled out of doing business in Russialeft Russia completelyfrom oil companies to McDonald's. As a result of these unprecedented sanctions, the ruble almost is immediately reduced to rubble. The Russian economy[laughter]. That's true, by the way. It takes about 200 rubles to equal $1. The economy is on track to be cut in half in the coming years. It was rankedRussia's economy was ranked the 11th biggest economy in the world before this invasion. It will soon not even rank among the top 20 in the world.
Taken together, these economic sanctions are a new kind of economic statecraft with the power to inflict damage that rivals military might. These international sanctions are sapping Russian strength, its ability to replenish its military, and its ability to project power. And it is Putinit is Vladimir Putinwho is to blame, period. At the same time, alongside these economic sanctions, the Western world has come together to provide for the people of Ukraine with incredible levels of military, economic, and humanitarian assistance.
In the years before the invasion, we, America, had sent over $650 million, before they crossed the border, in weapons to Ukraine, including anti-air and anti-armor equipment. Since the invasion, America has committed another $1.35 billion in weapons and ammunition. And thanks to the courage and bravery of the Ukrainian peoplethe equipment we've sent and our colleagues have sent have been used to devastating effect to defend Ukrainian land and airspace. Our allies and partners have stepped up as well. But as I've made clear: American forces are in Europenot in Europe to engage in conflict with Russian forces. American forces are here to defend NATO allies.
Yesterday I met with the troops that are serving alongside our Polish allies to bolster NATO's frontline defenses. The reason we wanted to make clear is their movement on Ukraine: Don't even think about moving on one single inch of NATO territory. We have a sacred obligation[applause]. We have a sacred obligation under article 5 to defend each and every inch of NATO territory with the full force of our collective power.
And earlier today I visited your National Stadium, where thousands of Ukrainian refugees are now trying to answer the toughest questions a human can ask: ""My God, what's going to happen to me? What's going to happen to my family?"" I saw tears in many of the mothers' eyes as I embraced them; their young childrentheir young childrennot sure whether to smile or cry. One little girl said, ""Mr. President""she spoke a little English""is my brother and my daddyare they going to be okay? Will I see them again?"" Without their husbands, their fathers, in many cases, their brothers and sisters who stayed back to fight for their country.
I didn't have to speak the language or understand the language to feel the emotion in their eyes, the way they gripped my hand, and little kids hung on to my leg, praying with a desperate hope that all this is temporary; apprehension that they may be perhaps forever away from their homes, almost with debilitating sadness that this is happening all over again. But I was also struck by the generosity of the people of Warsawfor that matter, all the Polish peoplefor the depths of their compassion, their willingness to reach out, their opening their hearts.
I was saying to the mayor they're preparing to open their hearts and their homes simply to help. I also want to thank my friend, the great American chef, Jos Andrs, and his team who helped feeling thosefeeding those who are yearning to be free. But helping these refugees is not something Poland or any other nation should carry alone. All the world democracies have a responsibility to help. All of them. And the people of Ukraine can count on the United States to meet its responsibility.
I've announced, 2 days ago, we will welcome 100,000 Ukrainian refugees. We already have 8,000 a week coming to the United States of other nationsnationalities. We'll provide nearly $300 million of humanitarian assistance, providing tens of thousands of tons of food, water, medicine, and other basic supplies. In Brussels, I announced the United States is prepared to provide more than $1 billion, in addition, in humanitarian aid.
The World Food Programme told us that despite significant obstacles, at least some relief is getting to major cities in Ukraine, but not Metropolno, excuse me, not Mariupol, because Russian forces are blocking relief supplies. But we'll not cease our efforts to get you humanitarian relief wherever it is needed in Ukraine and for the people who've made it out of Ukraine.
Notwithstanding the brutality of Vladimir Putin, let there be no doubt that this war has already been a strategic failure for Russia already. Having lost children myselfI know that's no solace to the people who have lost family. But he, Putin, thought Ukrainians would roll over and not fight. Not much of a student of history. Instead, Russian forces have met their match with brave and stiff Ukrainian resistance. Rather than breaking Ukrainian resolve, Russia's brutal tactics have strengthened the resolve. Rather than driving NATO apart, the West is now stronger and more united than it has ever been.
Russia wanted less of a NATO presence on its border, but now he has [we have]* a stronger presence, a larger presence, with over a hundred thousand American troops here, along with all the other members of NATO. In fact, Russia has managed to cause something I'm sure he never intended: The democracies of the world are revitalized with purpose and unity found in months that we'd once taken years to accomplish.
It's not only Russia's actions in Ukraine that are reminding us of democracy's blessing. It's our own countryhis own country, the Kremlin, is jailing protesters. Two hundred thousand people have allegedly already left. There's a brain drainleaving Russia. Shutting down independent news. State media is all propaganda, blocking the image of civilian targets, mass graves, starvation tactics of the Russian forces in Ukraine.
Is it any wonder, as I said, that 200,000 Russians have all left their country in 1 month? A remarkable brain drain in such a short period of time, which brings me to my message to the Russian people:
I've worked with Russian leaders for decades. I sat across the negotiating table going all the way back to Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin to talk arms control at the height of the cold war.
I've always spoken directly and honestly to you, the Russian people. Let me say this, if you're able to listen: You, the Russian people, are not our enemy. I refuse to believe that you welcome the killing of innocent children and grandparents or that you accept hospitals, schools, maternity wards that, for God's sake, are being pummeled with Russian missiles and bombs; or cities being surrounded so that civilians cannot flee; supplies cut off and attempting to starve Ukrainians into submissions.
Millions of families are being driven from their homes, including half of all Ukraine's children. These are not the actions of a great nation. Of all people, you, the Russian people, as well as all people across Europe, still have the memory of being in a similar situation in the late thirties and fortiesthe situation of World War IIstill fresh in the minds of many grandparents in the region.
Whatever your generation experienced, whether it experienced the siege of Leningrad or heard about it from your parents and grandparentstrain stations overflowing with terrified families fleeing their homes, nights sheltering in basements and cellars, mornings sitting through the rubble in your homesthese are not memories of the past. Not anymore. Because it's exactly what the Russian army is doing in Ukraine right now.
March 26, 2022. Just days beforewe're at the twenty-firstyou were a 21st-century nation with hopes and dreams that people all over the world have for themselves and their family. Now, Vladimir Putin's aggression have cut you, the Russian people, off from the rest of the world, and it's taking Russia back to the 19th century. This is not who you are. This is not the future reserveyou deserve for your families and your children. I'm telling you the truth: This war is not worthy of you, the Russian people.
Putin can and must end this war. The American people stand with you and the brave citizens of Ukraine who want peace. And my message to the rest of Europe: This new battle for freedom has already made a few things crystal clear. First, Europe must end its dependence on Russian fossil fuels. And we, the United States, will help. That's why just yesterday, in Brussels, I announced a plan with the President of the European Commission to get Europe through the immediate energy crisis.
Over the long term, as a matter of economic security and national security and for the survivability of the planet, we all need to move as quickly as possible to clean, renewable energy. And we'll work together to help get that done so that the days of any nation being subject to the whims of a tyrant for its energy needs are over. They must end. They must end. And second, we have to fight the corruption coming from the Kremlin to give the Russian people a fair chance. And finally, and most urgently, we maintain absolute unitywe mustamong the world's democracies.
It's not enough to speak with rhetorical flourish, of ennobling words of democracy, of freedom, equality, and liberty. All of us, including here in Poland, must do the hard work of democracy each and every day. My country as well. That's why[applause]. That's why I came to Europe again this week with a clear and determined message for NATO, for the G-7, for the European Union, for all freedom-loving nations: We must commit now to be in this fight for the long haul. We must remain unified today and tomorrow and the day after and for the years and decades to come.
It will not be easy. There will be costs. But it's a price we have to pay. Because the darkness that drives autocracy is ultimately no match for the flame of liberty that lights the souls of free people everywhere. Time and again, history shows that it's from the darkest moments that the greatest progress follows. And history shows, this is the task of our time, the task of this generation.
Let's remember: The hammer blow that brought down the Berlin Wall, the might that lifted the Iron Curtain were not the words of a single leader, it was the people of Europe who, for decades, fought to free themselves. Their sheer bravery opened the border between Austria and Hungary for the Pan-European Picnic. They joined hands for the Baltic Way. They stood for Solidarity here in Poland. And together, it was an unmistakable and undeniable force of the people that the Soviet Union could not withstand.
And we're seeing it once again today with the brave Ukrainian people, showing that their power of many is greater than the will of any one dictator. So, in this hour, let the words of Pope John Paul burn as brightly today: ""Never, ever give up hope, never doubt, never tire, never become discouraged. Be not afraid."" A dictator bent on rebuilding an empire will never erase a people's love for liberty. Brutality will never grind down their will to be free. Ukraine will never be a victory for Russia, for free people refuse to live in a world of hopelessness and darkness.
We will have a different future, a brighter future rooted in democracy and principle, hope and light, of decency and dignity, of freedom and possibilities. For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power.
God bless you all, and may God defend our freedom, and may God protect our troops. Thank you for your patience. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

And I was told thatthey said, you know, they've done a cutout of number 46, the Vicethe Presidency. I'm the 46th President. And I'm thinking, ""Well, maybe I can take it home."" [Laughter] That's solid steel, man. [Laughter] And you guys did that on your time. Well, thank you very much. I'm not going to try and take it home. [Laughter]
But look, folks, it really is: It's an honor to be here, for real. And I want to thank your soon-to-be new, full-blown, full-bore ironworker. Marty is already trying to get her to Boston, but that's another thing I got to warn you about. [Laughter]
But, folks, look, it's an honor to be here with Vice President Harris and with the Labor Secretary, Marty Walsh, a proud member and former president of the Laborers' Local Union 222223 up in Boston. And our Secretary of Energy, Jennifer Granholm, has got a few things we're going to build.
And I want to thank the Maryland delegation: Ben Cardin, who's been a friend for a long time; and Chris Van Hollen, who's a really close friend; and an outstanding Congressman, Anthony Brown, and other elected officials that are here. Look, all of whom fight for working people, in Maryland and in everyand every other State. Because if it happens here, it happens around the worldhappens around the country.
It's been an honor to be with the ironworkers of Local 5. And we talk about building a future that's made in America. We're talking about you. And this time we're going to get it really correct.
You know, one of the press persons said to meand I can't remember whoabout 3 months ago, thatI don't know if it's factual or not, but he said, ""You've used the word 'union' as President more than any other President in American history."" So let me tell you: I'm not sure that it's true.
Participant. It's true!
The President. But I tell you what: I promised you you'd have a union President. And I am, because you're the best.
You know, we talk about whether Wall Street built America. There are good folks on Wall Street; they're not bad folks. There are good people all over the country. I tell you who built America: the middle class. And the people who built the middle class are organized laborunions, unions. Unions did it. That's not hyperbole. That's a fact. That's a straight fact.
And the Executive order I'm going to sign today is going to help ensure that we build a better America, we build it right and we build it on time and we build it cheaper than it would have been otherwise.
You know, the Executive order is making sure that Federal construction projects get completed on time and under budget, saving taxpayers money, clearing construction zones quickly, and ensuring that everything the Federal Government signs to contract to build is built to last. You guys really, genuinely, are the best in the world. Notthat's not hyperbole. It's a fact.
To do that, we're using a tool that ironworkers here know very well, called ""project labor agreements."" I know you all know it, but folks who may be watching this may not fully understand it.
Simply put, these are agreements that contractors, subcontractors, and unions put in place before a construction site gets underway, before the construction begins. They ensure that major projects are handled by well-trained, well-prepared, highly skilled workers, and they ward off problems. They resolve disputes ahead of time, ensuring safer work sites, avoiding disruptions and work stoppages that can cause expensive delays down the line.
And that makes a big difference for the American taxpayer. Because when big construction projects are completed efficiently and with the highest degree of professionalism, it's good for the American taxpayer. That's not hyperbole; that's a fact. We don't talk about it though. We don't talk about how you all save the American taxpayers money.
It's good for families who live in those communities. All across the country, the Federal construction projects are being built as I speak. And it means that modernization of your local waterways will get done sooner, won't cost twice as much as expected. And when the next storm comes, the power will more likely stay on and homes and businesses will be better protected from flooding.
It means new air traffic control towers at the local airports will be up and running more quickly, so flights are safer at the airports and more efficient. It means new housing will be built on our military bases; will be of the highest quality, which these servicemembers deserve. It will hold up better and make life easier for our military families.
The Executive order I'm going to sign will help defuse problems before they arise. They're going to improve coordination between contractors, subcontractors, and workers on the job site. It's going to help guarantee a consistent supply of high-quality, highly trained workers.
You know, what people don't understand if they're notdon't know the industry is, you know, it's like you going to college, kid. Four years. Four years of busting your neck, learning a trade. This isn't something you walk up and show up in a day and raise your hand, ""I need a job."" You work like the devil for it. Fortunately, you get paid while you're doing it, and you're able to do it, but it is an educationfull-blown education you're getting in your trade.
Well, you'll have a voice on the work site, full commitment to getting the job done. And it's going to raise the bar on quality for some of those vital projects we're going to be building. And we're going to make sure that Federal construction projects are staffed with good-paying union jobs.
One of you actually came up to me today and said, ""Joe, you said you're going to do that, and you're doing it."" Well, when President Obama asked me to run the Recovery Act, I made sure every single job I could get was a union job, prevailing wage. Because I've noticed when folks are getting paid a decent wage, everybody in the community does better, everything looks better.
They're jobs you can raise a family on. Or as my dad would say, ""They're jobs you can put your head on the pillow at night and just have a little breathing room""a little security, a little breathing room. Jobs that can't be outsourced. And that's good for nearly 200,000 workers on Federal construction contracts right now. It's good for everybody.
I don't want to get going because I'll keep you here too long, because you know all of what I'm about towhat I've said, and you know what I've done, and you know what we're doing, and you know whatI know what you're doing.
But let me close with this: A week ago, I went to Pittsburgh to tour a former steel mill that's now a cutting-edge manufacturing research and development hub. Right before I left to the trip, I got word that a bridge collapsed. You saw it on television. It looked as bad in person as it did at the time. The bridge had been rated in poor condition, like, I might add, over 3,000 bridges in Pennsylvania, 45,000 across the Nation. It had been rated that way for the last 10 years.
When I got there, folks told me something close to a miracle had occurred. Because of a snowstorm that morning, school openings were late and commutes were delayed. So when that bridge collapsedand it was well over a hundred feet off thetwoalmost twoI don'tI didn'tI don't know the exact, but probably from down to the creek that it went over and the ravine, probably a couple hundred feet.
When it collapsed, instead of a bus with a couple people on itbeing packed with school buses full of children, the people on their way to work on the bridge that is one of the busiest bridgesyou know, there are more bridges in Pittsburgh than any other city in the world; with the three riversthe bridge was empty, relatively empty. Fortunately, no one was killed, but for a snowstorm.
Just imagine the challenges we face and the opportunities to build a better America, and extend it far beyond roads and bridges now that we canknow we have to do. We passed that infrastructure bill. But it's not just that.
Across the country right now there are countless buildings, ports, airports, power stations, and other Federal construction projects that need to be modernized and built for the future. We can't count on miracles, like happened inout in Pittsburgh, to prevent tragedies that are waiting in plain sight.
But what we can count on, what America has always counted on: the American worker, the hardest working, best trained workers in the world; American workers who, given just half a chance, have never, ever, ever, ever, ever let their country down, and gotten the job done.
And that's what this day is all about, in my view: getting the job done for the American taxpayers, getting the job done right the first time.
You know, folks, there's a law that's existed for a long time that has too many exceptions like this one had, and that is thatbuy American.
As President of the United States, I award contracts. And I'm now making it the caseand it's working; it's one of the reasons those jobs were upis unless the product that I'm purchasing for the American people was made in America and all of its component parts are made in America, we ain't buying it. We're just simply not buying it.
And what's going to happen herenot a joke; it's a fact. It's not a violation of any international laws either. What we're talking about here, with three exceptions I won't bore you withand they're highly unusualbut with three exceptions: Every single project that we're talking about that's paid for with Federal dollars and is a Federal project, it's going to be union jobs, every single one of them.
The last time we tried it, there were so many exceptions, I think only 19, 20 jobs[inaudible]. There are going to be thousands, thousands of people put to work. Not a joke. I mean, this is serious.
And guess what? The American public's going to be safer, and it's going to be cheapercheaper paying the right wage and the right trained people to begin with and get the job done right and on time.
So I'm about to walk over and sign an Executive order that's going to make that happen. And we're going to start once that order is signed.
Just remember: It ain't labor, it's unions. Thank you.
Now, usually you have a pen to give out to everybody around you, but we didn't have enough pens to bring with us. So I'm going to sign this order, but you're all going to get one of the signing pens, starting with the Maryland delegation. [Laughter]
[At this point, the President signed the Executive order.]
There you go.
Thank you all. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2022-02-04 00:00:00,Remarks on the Bureau of Labor Statistics Report on the Employment Situation in January,"
The President. Hey, folks. Good morning. It's still morning by about 10 minutes. [Laughter] I want to speak to you this morning about the extraordinary resilience and grit of the American people and American capitalism. Our country is taking everything that COVID has to throw at us, and we've come back stronger.
I'm pleased to report this morning what many of you already know: that America's job machine is going stronger than ever, fueling a strong recovery and opportunity for hard-working women and men all across this great country. America is back to work.
Today we learned that in January, our economy created 467,000 jobs. But that's not all. We learned that job growth in November and December over last year was revised up by more than 700,000 jobs. On top of that, 400,000 jobs are previouslyon top of the 400,000 that were previously reported.
This morning's report caps off my first year as President. And over that period, our economy created 6.6 million jobs6.6 million jobs. If you can't remember another year when so many people went to work in this country, there's a reason: It never happened.
Take a look at the chart. You can look at the lastall the way back to President Reagan. Look how many jobs we've created inon average per month. This isit's never happened before. And look, history has been made here.
But it comes alongside the largest drop in unemployment rate in a single year on record, the largest reduction in childhood poverty ever recorded in a single year, and the strongest economic growth this country has seen in nearly 40 years. Historic economic progress.
And I'm proud of the role the administration played in this economic plan and has played in the recovery: you know, the Rescue Plan that Democrats passed to get the economy going again; the bipartisan infrastructure law that's starting to get underway, rebuilding bridges, roads, highways, ports, airports, internet, and so much more that we're doing as well; and my decision at the outset of our administration to buy American. It's always been the law; it was very seldom ever followed. Now it's a reality, not an empty promise.
I made clear that when the Federal Government spends taxpayer dollars, we buy American productsAmerican products made in Americaincluding all the component parts of that product, with very few exceptions. With the support of the American private sector, our business leaders and entrepreneurs, our workers, our union leadersthey've all come together like never before in my days in Washington.
I know it hasn't been easy. I know that January was a very hard month for many Americans. I know that after almost 2 years, the physical and emotional weight of the pandemic has been incredibly difficult to bear for so many people. But here's the good news: We have the tools to save lives and to keep businesses open and keep schools open, keep workers on the job, and sustain this historic economic comeback.
Vaccination and boosters have proven incredibly effective. This past month, we started mailing out tens of millions of at-home tests to deliver to your home for free so you can determine whether or not you have COVID. And that's in addition to the 20,000 sites across America where you can get a test in person, for free, to determine whether or not you have COVID. And we have more treatments today to keep people out of the hospital, including lifesaving antiviral pills, which we purchased millions of.
And now we're seeing the difference of what our efforts have made. Look at what's happened: Just in the past 3 weeks today's extraordinary job report data was collected, the COVID crisis has been cut in halfdown in half in just 3 weeks. Still too many cases; still we have to be on the alert. But to be clear: This is a dramatic decline.
Now, I want to be clear: Even with the extraordinary news, even with historic economic progress we've made across the past year, we still have a lot of work to do. Making sure every American has a job is a great start, but it's not the finish.
For many Americans, wages are up this year. In January, wage increases were strong across the board, and that's good. We have to continue to keep wages growing. And we need even more high-paying jobs, jobs you can raise a family on and have some breathing room.
Two weeks ago, the CEO of Intel, Pat Gelsinger, came to the White House to announce a brandnew $20 billion semiconductor factorythey called it a ""campus""outside of Columbus, Ohio. It's going to create 7,000 jobs just constructing the facility and 3,000 permanent jobs running the facility, with an average salary of $135,000.
These semiconductors or microchips power virtually everything in our everyday lives, from our cellphones to automobiles to refrigerators, the internet, the electric grid. Without semiconductors, these things do not function in a modern economy.
So the spinoff of this is going to create thousands of additional jobs as well, helping us build more American products in manufacturing automobiles, appliances, and so much more. It's going to create jobs, and it's going to help ease inflation.
One of the reasons why automobiles cost so much money these days and they're responsible for one-third of all the inflation that's calculated in the market is because they lack the semiconductors to build the vehicles. Intel's announcement helps fix that problem.
Last week, I called a meeting of CEOs from General Motors, Ford, Microsoft, and other major corporations in America. Mary Barra of General Motors, the chairman of the boardthe CEO, I should sayannounced a $7 billion investment in a Michigan manufacturing plant to manufacture electric vehicles. It's going to create 4,000 new, quality jobs at prevailing wage.
That's on top of the announcement last year made by Ford's CEO, Jim Farley, who was with us, to invest $11 billion to make electric vehicles, creating 11,000 new good-paying jobs.
Look, last Friday, I went to Pittsburgh, where the Pacificthe Union Pacific Railroad announced the largest purchase of American battery-electric locomotives in history, built in Erie, Pennsylvaniabuilt by American manufacturing workers in Western Pennsylvania, creating even more good-paying jobs.
And again, the spinoff from that: These locomotives aren't just going to be purchased in America. Countries around the worldbecause they're going to be the best productare going to purchase them, American-made electric vehicles made in Erie, Pennsylvania. Good-paying jobs.
Look, we all know we're in competition with the world. These announcements are the drumbeat a jobof a job resurgence unlike anything we've seen in our history.
And it didn't happen by chance. It's a result of the economic plan I put into action on day one when I said it's going be ""buy America."" I'm delighted to keep it going and expand what we've done, because we have a great opportunity ahead of us to further progressmake progress wherebeyond what we've already made.
Look, the House of Representatives just passed, a few minutes ago, just a bit before I walked over here, to provide $90 billionover $90 billionfor research and development, manufacturing, and all those elements of the supply chain needed to produce end products right here in America, so we can keep delivering more announcements like the one we've had in these past few weeks.
Another way we're boosting our economy is by promoting competition. Look, hamburger is, you know, up four timesfour-fold almost in many places. Well, guess what? Meat processing, meat processors areshipping, railroads, and other industriesare dominated by a few giant companies that control the market they operate in.
And over the years, this domination of the market by a smaller number of companiessmaller and smallerit's about four in the meatpacking areahas reduced competition; squeezed out small businesses and farmers; and in many cases, increased pricesat almost all of themincreased prices for consumers.
Look, I'm a capitalist. But capitalism without competition is not capitalism, it's exploitation. So I'm going to continue to do everything in my power to work with the Congress to make our capitalist system work better, to provide more competition, and lower prices for American consumers.
And they're still going to do well. But that isn't going to be enough. We still need to ease the burden on working families by making everyday things more affordable and accessible.
Look, average people are getting clobbered by the cost of everything today. Gas prices at the pump are up. We're working to bring them down, but they're up. Food prices are up. We're working to bring them down as well.
Look, I grew up in a family where if the price for a gallon of gas at the pump went up significantly, it was felt by the family. I get it. I understand. But these things are necessities, but that's not the totality of what the family needs. They still have to pay for childcare. They still have to pay for prescription drugs. They still have to pay for health care.
There's more than one way to help a family when it comes to their standard of living. We're going to work to bring down the prices that are way up, but guess what? Guess what? We're going to keep strengthening the supply chain to bring down the costs of everyall of these goods.
But in the meantime, there is a lot we can do to give families a little extra breathing room. For example, childcare: Families can spend $14,000 a year per child, in some cases in this countryin some cases less than $14,000 a yearfor childcare. Our plan cuts in half mostwhat most families are paying, helping their budgets; helpingkeeping millions of parents, and especially women, allowed to go back to work because they can get childcare.
Or the cost of prescription drugs, like insulin: Insulin costs about $10 to make. But for families who need the insulin, they're paying up to $650 a month on average in some places and as high as $1,000 a month.
Think about all of those Americans out there with type 1 diabetes who need this insulin to stay alive and stay healthy, or the 200,000 American children with type 1 diabetes. Think about being one of the parents without the insurance or the money to pay for that insulin. How do you look your child in the eye who needs that insulin? They have no idea how they're going to figure out how to pay for it. Think about what it does to them: to their self-esteem, their dignity, their ability to look their child in the eye.
We cap the cost of insulin at $35 on our plan$35 a month. The companies are still going to make a healthy profit. We can do that tomorrow with the stroke of a pen.
But we have a generation ofso-called, for example, ""sandwich generation."" That is, you have a young child and an elderly parent who needboth need help. And look, we can help them take care of mom and dad and make it work.
There's a program that allows us toon Medicarethat someone can come and install a handrail in the shower so mom doesn't fall; to make sure they have what they need to live with safety and dignity in their home, pick up the prescriptions, make an occasional meals. We can do all that. So when mom and dad put their head on the pillow at night, they can have peace of mind that their elderly parents are doing well and their children are okay.
We're still going to work on gas prices. We're still going to work on the food prices. But in the meantime, we can deliver that peace of mind to the American people and give them a little breathing room.
And by the way, the proposals that I have out therenobody earning less than $400,000 a year would pay a single additional penny in taxes. Not a single penny. And a lot of companies that I've spoken to are willing to pay a little more in their corporate taxes and their personal taxes to see that happen.
You've heard me say it a hundred times: You've got 55 companies of the Fortune 500 companies that paid zero tax in the last couple years, and they made over $400 billion.
Look, we can do this without increasing the deficit. Actually, we've reduced the deficit over $300 billion.
And 17 Nobel laureates in economics came to me several months ago to say that this plan would not only not raise inflation, it would ease long-term inflationary pressures.
Look, the bottom line is this: The United States is once again in a position to not only compete with the rest of the world, but outcompete the rest of the world once again. If we can keep coming together and invest in the backbone of Americaworking class and the middle class folksthere's no limit to what we can achieve. So let's keep the raisesthe wages rising, and let's start lowering costs.
Our businesses are the best in the world. Our workers are the best in the world. Give them half a chance, and they'll outcompete anyone, anywhere in the world.
We can have a quality of life for working people that they deserve at the same time. And by the way, the middle class, when it does well, when the working class does well, everybody does well. Everything is better for the wealthy, the superwealthy, and the slightly wealthy. Nobody gets hurt.
So let's face these challenges head on. Let's keep building a better America.
I want to thank you, and God bless you, and may God protect our troops. Thank you.

2022-02-03 00:00:00,Remarks at a Gun Violence Strategic Partnership Meeting in New York City,"
Okay. Well, General Garland; Governor; Mr. Mayor; Representative JeffersJeffries, excuse me; Representative Velzquezthey rode up on the flight with meand other Members of Congress that are here: Thank you.
And I just want to thank Mayor Adams and Commissioner Sewell and the lawall the law enforcement that's here today fornot having me, for what you do every single day.
It'sand let me start by saying Detective Wilbert Mora and Jason Rivera are the ""who"" and ""what"" law enforcement ought to be. And theSenator Gillibrand and I have talked about that on the way up as well.
I've spoken to their families, and their loss for the city is also a loss for the Nation. You know, the future is cut short by a man with a stolen Glock with 40 roundsa magazine with 40 rounds. And it's really a weapon of war.
One of the things I was proudest of years ago, when I was in the SenateI was able to get these weapons and the size of magazines outlawed. That got changed. It got overruled. But I don't see any rationale to why there should be such a weapon able to be purchased. It doesn't violate anybody's Second Amendment rights to deny that opportunity.
But anyway, their futures were cut short by a man with a stolen Glock and that 40-round magazine. And I tell you, I want to thank the man back to my leftI think he's sitting right therefor taking on. Stand up.
Now, if you'll excuse aas we used to say in the Senate, ""a point of personal privilege,"" Iwhen everythingwhen the economy died in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and I moved down to Delaware with my dad and my mom and the family, I moved to a little town called Claymont, Delaware. And it was a steel town just across the border from Pennsylvania, right up in that arc.
And I went toI spent 12 years going to school there. Or actually, not 12; I started in third grade. At any rate, I went to a schoola little Catholic school called Holy Rosaryacross from a small police department and a fire hall. And everybody that I grew up with either became a cop, a firefighter, or a priest. I wasn't qualified for any of them, so here I am. [Laughter] But I admire the hell out of all of you. I really do. It's notI'm not being solicitous. I mean it sincerely.
And to the many parents, spouses, brothers, sisters who have to bury a piece of their soul in the deep earth, it's really tough stuff. It's hard as hellyou all know itto lose a colleague, to lose a son, a daughter, a husband, wife.
And I want to thankifthere are not many here, but I want to thank all the spouses of every one of you or your significant other, because every time you pin that shield on and walk out the door, they're worried whether they're going to get that phone callget that phone call. And too many have gotten the phone call lately.
And every day in this country, 316 people are shot, 106 are killed. And six NYPD officers have been victims of gun violence so far, just this yearthe same in the town north of me, Philadelphia; and my much smaller town of Wilmington, Delaware; and Washington, DC. Sixty-four children injured by gun violence so far this year, twenty-six killed. It's enough. Enough is enough.
Because we know we can do things about this but for the resistance we're getting from some sectors of the government and the Congress and the State legislatures and the organizational structures out there.
You know, Mayor Adams, you and I agree: The answer is not to abandon our streets. That's not the answer. The answer is to come together, the police and communities, building trust and making us all safer.
The answer is not to defund the police, it's to give you the tools, the training, the funding to be partners, to be protectors. And the community needs youand know the community. You know[applause]policepolicing that treats everyone with respect and dignity.
That's why I called on the Congress to pass a budget later this year that provides cities, like New York and others, with an additional $300 million for community policing, you know, where the police interact with the community, get to know the community, build trust in the community.
And I've noticed, in my experiencewhen I wrote the first crime bill, I noticed that, you know, I don't hear many communitiesno matter what their color or their backgroundsaying, ""I don't want more protection in my community."" I don't know, I haven't found one of those yet.
And so I've asked the Congress to provide $200 million to invest in community violence intervention programs as wellthey work; they workwhere community members with credibility work directly with people that are most likely to commit crimes or be victims of gun crimes. And they work.
For example, in 2017, the program I'm going to see this afternoon, which sends people to the communityin the community to interrupt violence, to mediate conflicts, to deescalatesucceed in preventing singlea single shooting from occurring in this largest public housing development last year. No shooting for a full year because they engage directly with the community.
You know, I know this is a priority for Senator Schumer, what you all are doing here. Iif I hear one more call from him that we need more money for housing and more money for copsI don't know, I'm going to send him back to you all. [Laughter] But all kidding aside, this is a half a billion dollars of proven strategies, and we know it will reduce crime.
Congress needs to do its job to pass the budget. Every one of these folks here from Congress are all supportive. But you know, it's time to fund communities, community police, and the people who are going to protect them.
Look, as I said, we're not about defunding, we're about funding and providing the additional services you need beyond someone with a gun strapped to their shoulder or to their hip.
We need more social workers. We need mental health workers. We need more people who when you're called on these scenes and someone is about to jump off a roof, there's not just someone standing there with a weapon; it's someone who also knows how to talk to people, talk them down. We can't expect you to do every single, solitary thing that needs to be done to keep a community safe. It's time to fund community policing to protect and serve the community.
And so I'm also calling for increased funding for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, and the U.S. Marshals offices. I'm confident that if we fund these programs, we'll see a reduction in violence.
In the next year's budget, I'm also going to try to double down on this investment. I think I got a lot of partners here in New York that are going to help. Mayor Adams, you say that gun violence is a sea fed by many rivers. Well, theyou know, I put forward a plan to dam up some of those streams.
You know, you can count on me to be a partner in that effort. And I have the U.S. AttorneyUnited States Attorney General here with me today. And we put together a comprehensive strategy to combat gun crime in cities like New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and many other citiesSan Francisco.
First, we want to crack down on the flow of firearms used to commit violence. That includes taking on and shutting down rogue gun dealers atand it's about doing background checks, as well as outright selling of thatmaking sure the people who are not allowed to have a gun, don't get the gun in the first place.
And again, for any of the press in here, the press listening: This doesn't violate anybody's Second Amendment right. There's no violation of a Second Amendment right. We talk like there's no amendment that's absolute. When the amendment was passed, it didn't say anybody can own a gun and any kind of gun and any kind of weapon. You couldn't buy a cannon inwhen thethis amendment was passed. And so no reason why you should be able to buy certain assault weapons. But that's another issue.
And look, one of the things that we focused on, the Attorney General and Iand we're getting to the point where I think we're going to be able to have a real impact on itincludes going after ghost guns. Ghost guns are the guns everyone in this room knows that can be purchased in parts, assembled at home, no serial number, and can't be traced. And they're as deadly as any other weapon out there. But the fact is, they are out there. And you know, this spring, the Justice Departmentthis spring, the Justice Department will issue a final rule to regulate these so-called ""ghost guns.""
But there's more we can do. Across the country, police departments report sharp increases in the number of ghost guns found at crime scenes. That's why, today, the department is launching an intensified National Ghost Gun Enforcement Initiative to determine and deter criminals from using those weapons to cover their tracks. If you commit a crime to the ghost gun, not only are State and local prosecutors going to come after you, but expect Federal charges and Federal prosecution as well.
We've also created a strike force to crack down on illegal gun trafficking across State lines. As the mayor said, as he pointed out, guns that are used to kill people in New York City, they aren't made in New York City, they aren't sold in New York City. They are sold in other places.
Today the Attorney General directed all U.S. attorneys in the United States to prioritize combating gun trafficking across State lines and city boundaries. The Justice Department is sending additional prosecutorial resources to help shut down what's referred to, as you all know, as the ""Iron Pipeline"" that funnels guns from shops in States like Georgia to crime scenes in Baltimore and Philadelphia and New York and so many other places.
Governor, you worked with the mayor and the NYPD and nine other States to create an Interstate Task Force on Illegal Guns. That's the kind of leadership that's going to solve the problem. And I'm eager to hear more about that progress.
And, folks, the second thing I want to point out is, I want to help every major city follow New York's lead to put together partnerships like this one you put together that meet on a daily basis.
Every day, here in New York City, like this meeting today, Federal, State, and local enforcement meet to share intelligence about arrests, shootings from the day before, and work to take those shooters off the streets as quickly as possible.
Just look around: This is what a partnership looks like, and this is what you put together. And it's an important partnership. And we need more cities adopting the same model.
That's why, today, the Attorney General is also directing U.S. attorneys to work with State and local law enforcement to strengthen partnerships like this one and to get repeat gun violence offenders off the street and behind bars.
You know, I want more cities and States to use some of the $350 billion we sent to them on the American Rescue Plan to fight crime, to keep our communities safe by hiring more police officers for community policing and paying police overtime and purchasing gun-fighting technologies, like technologies that hears, locates gunshots so there can be immediate response because you know exactly where it came from.
The third thing our plan calls for: investing in critical services that reduce crime and violence; community violence intervention programs, like the one I'm going to see after this meeting; summer school; afterschool programs for teens.
As the saying goes and the teachers have taught me, ""An idle mind is a devil's workshop."" We've got to have things for these kids to do, jobs for young adults, more school counselors and nurses, more mental health required in school, and mental health/substance abuse treatment as well.
Fourthly, with someonewhen someone finishes their time in prison, all our experience tells us, you just can't continue to give them 25 bucks and a bus ticket. They'll end up under the same bridge you arrested them in the first place from.
And so I don't want them ending up back in prison or being there because they've committed another crime. We need to be able to train for and get a job, find stable housing, reenter society, and have a second chance at a better life. My Department of Labor is funding programs that help formerly incarcerated individuals, including young adults, receive the education and training they need and then connect them to quality jobs.
I'll keep doing everything in my power to make sure that communities are safer. But Congress needs to do its part too: pass universal background checks, ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, close loopholes to keep out of the hands of domestic abusersweapons, repeal the liability shield for gun manufacturers.
Imagine had we had a liabilitythey're the only industry in America that is exempted from being able to be sued by the public. The only one. Imagine had that been the way with cigarette manufacturers. Where the hell would wewhere the heck would we be? We'd be in tough shape.
Why gun manufacturers? Because of the power of their lobbying ability. It's got to end. End. They've got to be held responsible for the things that they do that are irresponsible. And, folks, you know, it's the only industry in America, as I said, that's exempt from being sued. And I thinkI find it to be outrageous.
And, folks, these laws, if we're able to pass them, are going to save lives, and moreand equally importantly, help you protect one another and protect yourself, put law enforcement in a morea safer circumstance. We have an opportunity to come together and fulfill the first responsibility of government and our democracy: to keep each other safe.
So I want to thank you all. There's much more to say, but I probably already said too much, because a lot of people are going to speak. But let's get this done. Let's get this done.
And God bless the men and women who put their lives on the line every single day to keep our communities safe.
Now I'm going to turn it over, with your permission, to the Attorney GeneralAttorney General Garland.
General.

2022-02-03 00:00:00,"Remarks on the Death of Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) Terrorist Organization Leader Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi, Also Known as Hajji Abdullah, in a United States Counterterrorism Operation in Atmeh, Syria","
Good morning. Last night, operating on my orders, United States military forces successfully removed a major terrorist threat to the world: the global leader of ISIS, known as Hajji Abdullah.
He took over as leader of ISIS in 2019 after the United States counterterrorism operation killed al-Baghdadi. Since then, ISIS has directed terrorist operations targeting Americans, our allies and our partners, and countless civilians in the Middle East, Africa, and in South Asia.
Hajji Abdullah oversaw the spread of ISIS-affiliated terrorist groups around the world after savaging communities and murdering innocents. He was responsible for the recent brutal attack on a prison in northeast Syria holding ISIS fighters, which was swiftly addressed by our brave partners in the Syrian Democratic Forces.
He was the driving force behind the genocide of the Yazidi people in northwestern Iraq in 2014. We all remember the gut-wrenching stories: mass slaughters that wiped out entire villages, thousands of women and young girls sold into slavery, rape used as a weapon of war.
And thanks to the bravery of our troops, this horrible terrorist leader is no more. Our forces carried out the operation with their signature preparation and precision, and I directed the Department of Defense to take every precaution possible to minimize civilian casualties.
Knowing that this terrorist had chosen to surround himself with families, including children, we made a choice to pursue a special forces raid, at a much greater risk than ourto our own people, rather than targeting him with an air strike. We made this choice to minimize civilian casualties.
Our team is still compiling their report, but we do know that as our troops approached to capture the terrorist, in a final act of desperate cowardice, hewith no regard to the lives of his own family or others in the building, he chose to blow himself upnot just with a vest, but to blow up that third floor rather than face justice for the crimes he has committed, taking several members of his family with him just as his predecessor did.
I'm grateful for the immense courage and skill and determination of our U.S. forces who skillfully executed this incredibly challenging mission. The members of our military are the solid-steel backbone of this Nation, ready to fly into danger at a moment's notice to keep our country and the American people safe, as well as our allies.
And I'm also grateful to the families of our servicemembers. You serve right alongside yourthese soldiers and sailors, marines, special forcesthe loved ones, giving them the strength and support they need to do what they do.
To our servicemembers and their families: We're forever grateful for thewhat you do for us, and we owe you a debt. Thank you.
We're also aided by the essential partnership of the Syrian Democratic Forces. I want to commend our dedicated intelligence community, the Department of Defense, and members of our national security team throughout the Government whose meticulous and tireless work over the course of many months ensured that this mission succeeded. This operation is testament to America's reach and capability to take out terrorist threats no matter where they try to hide anywhere in the world.
I'm determined to protect the American people from terrorist threats, and I will take decisive action to protect this country.
And we'll continue working with our close allies and partnersthe Syrian Democratic Forces; the Iraqi Security Forces, including the Kurdish Peshmerga; and more than 80 members of the global coalitionto keep pressure on ISIS, to protect our homeland.
We remain vigilant. We remain prepared.
Last night's operation took a major terrorist leader off the battlefield. And it sent a strong message to terrorists around the world: We will come after you and find you.
Once again, today, we continue our unceasing effort to keep the American people safe and to strengthen security of our allies and partners around the world.
I want to thank you all. And may God bless you, and may God protect our troops.
I'm heading off to New York right now; I'm late. And I thank you for your time. Appreciate it.
Q. Mr. President, has the threat from ISIS been eliminated, sir?
Q. How many U.S. troops were involved, sir?

2022-02-03 00:00:00,Remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast,"
Well, thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I don't know who she's talking about[laughter]but thank you.
Folks, look, let me sayI hadn't planned onI didn't know I was going to get that kind of introduction. But let me say at the outset that, you know, we've all gone through really difficult timesevery one of you out therein one way or another. And I had an overwhelming advantage, and I mean it sincerely.
I had a family that was there for me every single, solitary moment. And so I don't deserve this credit for enduring that so many people I meetthink of all the people you know, whether they're constituents or friends or relatives, who get up every morning, don't have anybodydon't have anybody, and they put one foot in front of the other, and they do it. They lost a child, they lost a mother, a father, a husband, someone close to themjust plucked awayand they get up every single day and put one foot in front of the other. And they're the people who deserve our recognition and our credit.
I think I've talked to Bill and Grace Nelson about this: The only thingtoday is my son Beau's birthday. But the only thing that Beau said to me when he waswe were told he washe was going to die within minutes orif an hourthat he looked at me, and he said: ""Dad, promise mepromise me, Dad, you're going to stay involved."" I said: ""I'll be involved. I'll be good, Beau."" He said: ""No, dad, promise me. Give me your word as a Biden that you're going to stay engaged.""
Because he knew, like a lot of youwhat you've been throughthe first instinct is, you just want to curl up in a ball and just leave, no longer do what you've done your whole life that you'vehe said, ""DadDad, promise me."" ""I give my word.""
And that was the last conversation in Walter Reed Hospital, lying there in the bed. And then he looked at me and he said, ""And, Dad""and his brother Hunter who was his closest friend. We were all three on the bed. And he turned to me and he said, ""Dad, I want you to know I'm not afraid.""
So, you know, I had so much helpso much helpstarting from the time that I lost my wife and daughter in an accident. But look, everybody has got horrible things they've had to deal with. And we've watched themI sat in the Senate for 36 years. We watched people literally die in our midst. I remember that scene where Teddy walked out. OrI mean, thereso, you know, I'm flattered that you think as highly of me as you stated, Kirsten, but I hadI had a lot of help. I had a lot of help. And I want to thank you for the introduction. It's very gracious. But like I said, there's a lot more people who've done a lot more.
And to my good friend Chris Coonstwo things I tell everybody about Chris Coons you've got to know: One, he's smarter than you. [Laughter] And, two, the boy can preach. He's the only guy that went to law school and got a divinity degree at the same time. I worry about ""divine"" lawyers. [Laughter] Butanyway, Chris, thank you. You've been a great friend.
And asBryan, as you were speaking, Chuck sort of leaned over; he didn't say anything, but he just like, ""Was that Delaware?"" But it was Delaware. It's why I got involved in politics in the first place.
I remember sitting ongoing to a little Catholic grade school in Claymont, Delaware, which was a steel town that was dying. And the bus would gomy mother would drive me to the school parking lotit was called Holy Rosary Schoolfrom a littleand it was called Brookview Apartments. Used to be section 8 housing later.
And I get out of the busI get out of the car. And this is where I-95 runs parallel to these days. And I said, ""Mom, why are all those kids""it was then ""colored."" ""Why are all those colored kids in that bus?"" Because in Scranton there weren't anythere were very few Blacks. She said, ""They're not allowed to go to school with us here, in Delaware."" So, you knowand Milton wasn't what you might call the epicenter of desegregation.
And so you've been through a lot, but you've done a lot as well. And I thank you.
And, KariKari Jobe, you have the voice of an angel, kid. [Laughter] I tell you what: You really do. And that guy sitting next to you, he's a lucky guy. [Laughter] He's a lucky guy. And besides, he has all his hair. [Laughter]
And Vice President Harris, Majority Leader Schumer, Mitch McConnelland, Mitch, I don't want to hurt your reputation, but we really are friends. [Laughter] And that is not an epiphany we're having here at the moment. We've alwaysyou've always done exactly what you've said. You're a man of wordof your word, and you're a man of honor. Thank you for being my friend.
And, folks, Members of Congress and spouses: I'm honored to join you all today.
You know, we're keeping our prayers for Senator Lujn, and keep him in your prayers today. I think, from what I understand, he's going to be okay and be back with us in the not-too-distant future. But we pray for a safe recovery.
And a special thank you to the bipartisan chairs of this breakfast: Representative Lamb and Walberg, [Senators]* Gillibrand and Rounds. Mike, I know it's been 3 months to this day that you lost Jean to cancer. So, you knowyou know of which I speak. And it's like losing a piece of your soul. And Iyou know, II remember.
Today, as I said, is a day that a lot of us can remember the times when we losteach of us. And just like I miss my son every single day, Ithere'sI know he's always with me, for real. He's always with me.
Congresswoman McBath, just like your precious son Jordanhe's always going to be with you, for real. It becomes a piece of you. You know, how many times did you all been through this, about to make a decision and say, ""What would Beau want?"" Or ""What would Jill want?"" Or ""What would""you know, whatever it is. So it'syou know.
And for everyone out there who has lost a piece of their soul, they're always with you. And all through the pain, I think youif you can find purpose, find purpose. Purpose of a life that makes you worthy in their eyes and what they expect of you.
This breakfast usually is held in a big Washington hotel with a big crowd. Today we're here in the Visitor Center of the United States Capitol with a much smaller crowd, a more intimate setting, to see each other here and listen to each otherstanding in this, which is, in Governmental terms, a ""sacred place.""
I thank ourI think about our former colleagues and close friends we lost in this year: Bob Dole; Harry Reid; Johnny Isakson, who was a hell of guy; Max Cleland; Carl Levin; Mike Enzi; John Warner; and Walter Mondale. And you know, I learned a long time ago: Never make one good eulogy. Because if you make one good eulogy, you've got to do a lot of eulogies. But I've had the pleasure of knowing their families. And there's a lot of good friends, both sides of the aisle, who disagreed on many, many things, who still talked and listened to one another.
I think I've said to Mitch and some of you earlier, in the last couple of years, that, you know, one of the things I don't know for sure, but I think is missing in the Congress is, we don't spend as much time with one another as we used to. We used to eat lunch together. I mean, literally sit downnot in the Senate Dining Room of the Senate or that small dining room off to theright across the hall from the visitors dining room, and there were those two big round tablesbigbig dining room tables and a buffet.
And I remember when I first got here, after my wife and daughter were killed in an accident, my boys were still in the hospitaland I remember Teddy would always come and say, ""Come to lunch."" I didn't want any part of going to lunch. And one day, he just dragged me over to lunch. And he said, ""You'll learn more there than anyplace else.""
And I would go to lunch there, literally every day, and listen to the senior members. And you learn about their losses, their happiness. You learn about them. You learn about theiryou know, I remember one day I walked in and there was a little corner in the tableor a corner table, when the big table was filled. And I sat down. And Jim Eastland said: ""Come over here, Joe. Sit down here."" And I wasn't about to sit in John Stennis's seatand because he sat at the head of the table. And he said: ""No, come on. He's gone."" So I ordered my hamburger or whatever I ordered and took a couple of bites. And in walks John Stennis. And I immediately put a napkin on all my stuff, and I said: ""I'm finished, Mr. Chairman. Come on. Right here.""
I later got a handwritten letter from him, about 3 o'clock in the afternoon: ""I appreciate the honor of you recognizing my seat, but you didn't finish your meal. I promise this favor will be returned."" He not only returned, he actually endorsed me when I ran for President from Mississippi. [Laughter] And I thinkthat was an expensive hamburger for him. [Laughter]
But I guess what I'm trying to say is: You know, when you know one another, when you knowand no matter how badly you disagreeand people think, Rev, that in the days as divided here, we hadwe had a lot of flat-out, old segregationists still in our caucus. But Teddy Kennedy would argue like hell with Jim Eastland, and then he'd go down to have lunch. Didn't agree with one another, but they treated each other with respect even in that day.
And I just think that, when you learn that another man or womanand you're flying a codel, and someone has their husband or wife with them, and you learn that they have a kid with a problem with alcoholism, or you learn that they have a daughter who ishas breast cancer. You learn that they haveit's hard to dislike the person.
And so one of the things I pray forand I mean itis that we sort of get back to the placeand it's so busy; I think things have changed so muchbut that we get to really know each other. It's hard to really dislike someone when you know what they're going through is the same thing you're going through.
You know, like President Eisenhower, the first President to attend this breakfast 70 years agoat the time, President Eisenhower saidhe said, ""There's a need we all have in these days and times for some help which comes from outside ourselves."" Outside ourselves.
I've attended many of these Prayer Breakfasts over the yearswith our Nation at war, in struggle, in strife, peace, in times of prosperity, when everybody was getting on, but a nation in prayer. Jill and I have been humbled by the prayers of so many of you, and it means everything to us. We pray for our Nation as we face an inflection point in our history.
So much is going to change, no matter who's sitting in my job. The world is changing. The world is changing. Ithere's athe momentbut there's also a moment of great progress, of lives saved in this pandemic, not just the ones lost; new jobs created for people, new hope for rebuilding the Nation, but also a moment of pain for the lost lives and the lives lost in this pandemic. And the cruel twist of fates that occur.
You know, at a moment of great division of our democracy is at greatgrave risk. I pray that we follow what Jesus taught us: To serve rather than be served. I don't always do it. I hope to try. I don't always do it.
I pray to keep the faith. That very promise of America, believing that there's nothing we can't do, where every person is created equal in the image of God, no matter who or where we come from, who we are, or what our color, or how we choose to pray, or whether or not we choose to pray; they deserve to be treated equally throughout their lives.
Faith in the very idea of America that can be defined, in my view, by a single word. I've been saying this for over 30 years. When I get asked to define America, one word: ""Possibilities."" ""Possibilities.""
One of the reasons why other countries sometimes think we're arrogant is, we believe anything is possible. Anything is possible. And faith in the American people will prove each and every day we're a great nation because we're, at our heart, a good people. We do bad things when we get frightened.
Saint Augustine wrote that, ""A people was a multitude defined by a common object of their love."" I believe the common objects of our love that define us as Americans are opportunity, liberty, dignity, respect, honor, service, truththings everybody recognizes both here and around the world.
As I stand in this citadel of democracy that was attacked 1 year ago, the issue isfor us is unity. How do we unite us again? Unity is elusive, but it's really actually necessary. Unity doesn't mean we have to agree on everything. But unity is where enough of usenough of usbelieve in a core of basic things: The common good, the general welfare, a faith in the United States of Americathe United States of America.
Nearly 3 weeks ago, we were reminded of that truth. A gunman entered a synagogue in Colleyville, Texas. He took four worshippers hostage, including a rabbi, for 11 hours.
But violence and vengeance didn't pierce the goodness and grace of that scene. Heroic law enforcement officers were joined by local faith leaders, including an imam, a Baptist minister, who offered their help. A nearby Catholic church opened its doors for the hostages' families.
At sunset, a group of Muslim womenfriends of the rabbi's wifewalked in with one of the rabbi's favorite foods. They hugged, and they wept. Because of the bravery of the hostages and the law enforcement officers, the hostages wereescaped safely, and the families were reunited.
When asked later if he would change anything, the rabbi said, quote, ""We will do what we always do, which is the best we can."" ""Which is the best we can."" I had a long conversation with the rabbi. It was interesting to hear him describe the scene and how faith mattered: Whether you're in a synagogue or a church or a mosque or a temple, whether you're religious or not, we're all imperfect human beings, trying our bestthe best we can, because we can't know the future. We can't know what's coming. But we also can't live in fear every step of the way.
That's America. From darkness, we found joy, hope, and light.
Rather than driving us apart, faith can move us together. Because all the great confessional faiths have the same fundamental basic beliefs: not just faith in a higher power, but faith to see each other as we should, not as enemies, but as neighbors; not as adversaries, but as fellow Americans.
And as leaders of this Nation who work and pray together, there is an oath to God and country to uphold and a charge to keep: to stand in the breach and to protect our democracy, to work together to right wrongs. That's why we all came here, to make the most of our time on Earth.
For if a house divided cannot stand, surely a house united can do anything. And if we do that, I think we'll have done our duty. With history and God watching, we will have to prove that there is nothing beyond the capacity of the United States when we're unitedthe United States.
You know, some of the senior Senators who are here used to kid me because I was quoting Irish poets on the floor of the United States Senate. And there's a poem, ""The Cure at Troy,"" written by an Irish poet who I got to know. It says: History teaches us not to hope ""on this side of the grave. But then, once in a lifetime, [that] . . . tidal wave of justice [rises] up, and hope and history rhyme.""
I honestly believe we're at one of those moments. There's so much at stake. The division has become so palpable, not just here, but around the world. We have a chance. We have a chancea chanceto make hope and history rhyme, because the rest of the world is looking to us.
Every time I'd walk out of my Grandpa Finnegan's house up in Scrantonsome of you heard me say this beforehe'd yell, ""Joey, keep the faith."" My grandmother would yell, ""No, Joey, spread it."" Let's go spread the faith.

2022-02-02 00:00:00,Remarks on Relaunching the Cancer Moonshot and an Exchange With Reporters,"
The President. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I'm Joe Biden, Jill Biden's husband. [Laughter] I want to thank you, Doctor, for that introduction. But I want to thank you more for all the effort you put in to change, save, alter people's lives and your dedication to it.
And as we used toI used to say in the Senate, I think it's still said in the Senate: ""If you excuse the point of personal privilege,"" I'd like tosee that doctor on the end there? That's the man who spent 18 months trying to save our son's life. Doctor, I love you. The whole family loves you. Folks, the doctor's optimism and fearlessness embodies what our Cancer Moonshot is all about.
And of course, I want to thank Jill and Kamala and Doug. They just shared how personal it is for them and our families andlike so many of you. Every one of you have a story. Every one of you have a story.
And our message today is this: We can do this. I promise you we can do this. For all those we lost, for all those we miss, we can end cancer as we know it. I committed to this fight when I was Vice President. It's one of the reasons why, quite frankly, I ran for President. Let there be no doubt: Now that I am President, this is a Presidential White House priorityperiod.
You know, with the bipartisan Members of Congressand I'veI don't want to start, because I'll leave somebody out. [Laughter] But you know, Congress is here. And this is, they can tell you, one of the truly bipartisan issues in the United States Congress.
I know there are votes, but that includes Senator Patrick Leahy, Michael Bennet, Amy Klobuchar, Chris Van Hollen, Sanford Bishop, Representative Joyce Beatty, Barbara Lee, Jim McGovern, Donald Payne, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Bonnie Watson Coleman, Tom Cole, Brian HigginsI said I wasn't going to do this[laughter]Terri SewellTerri Sewell.
And it can be truly an American moment if it'sI'm sure I've left somebody out, for which I apologize. But this can really be an American moment that proves to ourselves and, quite frankly, to the world that we can do really big things.
You know, we've made enormous progress in the past 50 years since Congress passed the Presidentand President Nixon signed into law the National Cancer Act and declared war on cancer. We learned cancer is not a single disease. We used to think, at that time, it was a single disease. There are over 200, as you all know200 different types of cancer caused by different genetic mutations in our cells.
We discovered new medicines, therapies, early detection, prevention measures that extend lives and save lives. In the first 25 years since the National Cancer Act, the death rate from cancer was largely unchanged. Then things began to change. The progress over the last 25 years: The death rate has fallen by more than 25 percent.
But here's the deal: Despite the progress of lives extended and lives saved, cancer is still the number-two cause of death in America, second only to heart disease. In the last 2 years of COVID-19 pandemic, it's taken more thanthe pandemic has taken more than 800,000 American lives. But that same period of time, cancer has claimed 1.2 million American lives year in and year out.
For too many patients and their families ondiagnosed with cancer, instead of hope, there's also bewilderment. Remember, Doc, you telling the family that you had to be ablewe had to be able to ask questions and you were available, because it's a hard road to understand and to traverse: the feeling of being on your own, a static [statistic]* adrift in a sea of patients, frustrated that hospitals and doctors can't onlyeasily share your medical records or help find answers when there'sminutes count; having to advocate for even the most basic care and attention for your loved one; a flood of informationa completely different language, in many caseswith no one to help you decipher it; being within reach of a therapya therapy that's too expensive or your insurance won't cover it.
Despite all the progress, there's still a sense of powerlessness, guilt that maybe you're not doing enough because you don't know enough, and fear.
So when President Obama asked me to launch our Cancer Moonshot in our administration, our goal was to bring a new sense of urgency to make the system of prevention, research, and patient care to take advantage of the 21st-century science and technology.
We began the process. Many of you in this room were a part of that. We harnessed the resources of the Federal Government to change the culture, increase cooperation among scientists, and break down some of the silos.
I'd note, parenthetically, I remember I wanted to transfer a particular scan from a hospital in Pennsylvania to a hospital in DC, and I was told they couldn't do itwasn't able to do it. Could transfer just about anything else in the world, but they couldn't do it because the hospitals didn't want the other hospitals to have access to theirbecause the patients could change their mind, with all the records.
That included everything from making federally funded cancer research more accessible to the public, instead of hiding behind a paywall. We launched trials.cancer.gov so everyone can look up cancer clinical trials across the country and around the world.
I traveled the country, bringing together leaders of health care, technology, education, business, and technology. I visited most of the major cancer centers, literally, in the world, met with heads of state in those countries, and decided how we could work together to try to make progress. I remember a particularly good meeting in Australia.
One of the final pieces of legislation that President Obama signed into law was the bipartisan 21st Century Cures Act with the help of Members of Congress, particularlyI don't know ifis Fred Upton here? Fred, are you here? Well, Fred Upton was part of it and Diana DeGette in the House.
It streamlined the Food and Drug AdministrationFDAso that new cancer treatments can be evaluated faster. It provided 7 years of new funding, including research on cancer disparities, trial networks to discover new drugs, and new efforts for childhood cancer.
The President of the Senateas President of the Senate, I presided over the overwhelming vote, after the election had already taken placethe Presidential electionwhen everything is supposed to come to a screeching halta bipartisan vote to fund over $6 billion. And I watched my friendand he is my friend; we disagree a lotMitch McConnell stand there and ask unanimous consent to name the cancer provisions after our son Beau.
The Cancer Moonshot brought the country and the world closer together on this issue.
And when we left office, Jill and I knew we had to keep it going. So we tookand a lot of youwe had five Nobel laureates and others who were involved, through the cancerthe Biden Cancer Initiative. We focused on turning the Moonshot into a movement to create the cancer research and care system that most people think we already have and that they all deserve, but they don't know they don'twe don't have it until they try to deal with it.
And everywhere we'd go, people would share their storiesin grocery stores, airports, rope lines. And while we heard stories of loss and despair, the stories began to change just a little bit, a change of feeling, real hope. But not because of me and Jill, but because of all of you in this room and so many more at home: doctors, researchers, advocates, caregivers, patients, survivors.
And that's why, today, I'm proud to announce our plan to supercharge the Cancer Moonshot as a central effort of the Biden-Harris administration. It's bold. It's ambitious. But it's completely doable.
Just as we harnessed the science to develop cutting-edge COVID-19 vaccines and treatments, we'll bring a fierce sense of urgency to the fight against cancer. The goal is to cut the cancer death rate in half in the next 25 yearsat least by 50 percentand to turn more cancers from death sentences into chronic diseases that people can live with; to create a more supportive experience for patients and their families; and, by doing these things and more, to end cancer as we know it.
And here's what we're fighting and how we know what cancer looks like today: a disease where we often diagnose it too late, and we have too few effective ways to prevent it. The stark inequities based on race, disparity, ZIP Code, sexual orientation, gender identity, and other factors still persist.
And we know too little about why treatments work in some patients and the exact samethat same patient with the exact same diagnosed cancer, it doesn't work in that patient. Where we still lack strategies to develop treatments for some cancers. Where we don't do enough to help patients and their families navigate through the process. Where we don't learn enough from patients' experienceexperiences or their data.
In fact, when we first started this work, one of the first things we did was make sure that doctors and researchers work together, share information, allow patients to share their data with other doctors and researchers to help others. But there's so much more to do.
I remember when we were going through this in the Moonshot and my saying thatI was told that ""Well, patients don't want to share their data."" They all want to share their data. [Laughter] Sometimes, you all don't want to share what you know. [Laughter]
And for each of the ways we know cancer today, we know we can change its trajectory. For example, to prevent cancer, scientists are exploring if the new mRNA vaccine technology that brought us safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines could also be used to stop cancer cells when they failwhen they first arrive, get them then.
To target the right treatments to the right patients, we're learning more about how to use genetics, immune response, and other factors to tell which combinations of treatments that are likely to work best for a particular individual.
To address inequities, we can target prevention, detection, and treatment efforts so that all Americanswhether they're urban, rural, or Tribal communitieshave equal access to cancer diagnosis, therapeutics, clinical trials. There's so much more we can do.
And as I said at the beginning, this is a Presidential priority. I will do my part on funding and using my authorities as President to break logjams and speed breakthroughs. I challenge and encourage all of youall of you to continue to do your part. This will be bipartisan. This will bring the country together and, quite frankly, other nations as well.
Here are some of the actions that I'm announcing today:
First, I've formed a new Cancer Cabinet, which is convened in thewe will convene in the coming weeks, to include members of the Cabinet who are here today, all of the people sitting on the stage here. They'll drive a whole-of-Government effort to unleash every possibility within our power, within their jurisdictions.
The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, led by senior scientist and adviser Dr. Eric Lander, sitting on the end there, will chart the path for the Cancer Moonshot for 2022 and beyond.
And I'm calling on Congress to fund my proposed ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. This will be a new kind of entity within the National Institute of Healththe NIHwith autonomy and authorities to drive unprecedented progress in biomedicine.
It's based on DARPA. Most everybody knows, in this town, what DARPA is. That's the Defense Department's Advanced Research Project Agency that has led to breakthrough technologies that protect our national security, from the internet to GPS and so much more.
ARPA-H will have a singular purpose: to drive breakthroughs to prevent, detect, and treat diseases, including cancer, Alzheimer's, and diabetes and other diseases. And I think there's strong bipartisan support for this, but it costs money. And it's the bestthese are the best dollars we could spend. So we've got to get it done, and we've got to get it done now and not wait any longer.
I'm also calling on the scientific and medical communities to bring the boldest thinking to this fight. I'm calling on the private sector to develop and test new treatments, make drugs more affordable, and share more data and knowledge that can inform the public and benefit every company's research.
And I'm respectfully calling on people living with cancer and caregivers and families to keep sharing their experience and pushing for progress. You'll have a voice and a seat at the table, I promise you.
And here's the one thing we can all do: Americans missed more than 9009 million cancer screenings in the last 2 years because of COVID. Nine million. We have to get cancer screenings back on track and make sure that they are accessible to all Americans.
So today I'm announcing a call to action for cancer screening and early detection. If you were supposed to get a cancer screening during the pandemic, call your primary care doctor today. If you're that doctor, talk to your patients. Get a screening scheduled, whether it's in the office, at home, or through a telehealth visit. Because the Affordable Care Act now will cover [requires]* most private insurance plans, as well as Medicare and Medicaid, to cover the recommended preventive care screening free of charge.
I'm calling on companies, health care providers, nonprofits, and others to step up, including developing mobile units and popup clinics to reach people where they live.
And if you're putting off screening because you're afraid of what you'll findthey'll findlet me say thisand so many people areput it off: Last November, I got a colon cancer screening. I'm glad I did. Trust me, I know cancer is scary. Going to the doctor's can be scary. But screening is how you catch it early, before it's too late. The earlier you get it, the better shot you have.
Let me close with this: There's a quote thatwhen I made one of these speeches, years ago5, 6 years agoattributedit was attributed to Yo-Yo Ma. I later was informed it was attributed to Vince Lombardi. [Laughter] But whoever the hell gave the quote[laughter]it makes sense. Here's the quote: ""Practice makes permanent. Only perfect practice makes perfect.""
My challenge to everyone involved in this fight against cancer: Take a hard look at your practice. Ask yourself, are you practicing perfectly, or am I practicing to make the old way permanent? Old practices that created data silos, minimized the role of patients, fostered the wrong kind of competition instead of the right kind of collaboration.
I know we can get this rightI'm positive we canby not losing sight of the ultimate goal: the patient's health. And by not losing sight of something else I also believe: America is the single place on Earthsingle country that can be defined, as I told Xi Jinping, by one word, ""possibilities."" Possibilities.
When we work together in America, there is nothingnothingbeyond our capacity. Nothing. So let's show the world what's possible. Let's show the world that we're committed. Let's show that we can do big things, that thein the United States of America, when we work together, there's nothing beyond our graspI mean, nothing beyond our grasp.
And I know of nothing, as I think my colleagues would say, that's more bipartisan than take on this fight and fundamentally change cancer as we know it. It's a mission that can truly unify the Nation, that shows us at our best, working together, andrather than working against one another.
For every patient asking for one more dayI remember I've metI met with over 3,000 researchers in the various organizations, and they're good. They're devoting their whole lives to try to save someone. And they work really long hours, but they're not practitioners. They've not had that patient come up and say, ""Doc, can you give me just 2 more weeks so I can see my daughter marry."" ""Doc, all I needcan you do anything to give me just 6 more months to see the baby born. That's all I'm asking for, Doc.""
There's a sense of overwhelming urgencyoverwhelming urgencyif you're a patient or a family member of a patient. Every patient asking just for 1 more day. They're not asking to ""cure me."" One more day. One more week. ""Can I get another year to be able to doboom.""
For survivors and caregivers who carry the physical and mental scars of treatments and recovery and for those who have lost and for the ones we can still save: Let's end cancer as we know it. I refuse to believeI refuse to believethis is beyond our capacity. I refuse to believe it.
You know, when I put together the Cancer Moonshot, I was Vice President, and the President gave me authority to task anyone in the administration. And when they found out I had the Department of Energy and Ernie Moniz, when they found out I had NASA and a lot of other agencies, they looked at me like, ""What's the matter with you?""
I said: ""Guess what? NASA knows more about radiation than all of you."" [Laughter] Seriously. And Ernie Monizwe were at a place where you got a billion, billion calculations per second. And it goes on. Skills people never thought would impact on this can do it.
So my plea to you scientists is: Share data as best you can. My plea to my Members in Congress is: Let's fund this particular program and focus on it until we beat it. And to the American people: Keep the hope alive. There is hope. There is hope.
And I'm confidentabsolutely confidentif we make all our effort to deal with it, we can make fundamental changes in people's lives and change the families in this countryin a much better position than they are today with regard to cancer.
Thank you all for being here. I appreciate it. Thanks, everybody.
[At this point, the President left the podium to greet attendees. He then returned to the podium and spoke as follows.]
Every time I'd walk out of my Grandpop Finnegan's house in Scranton, he'd yell, ""Joey, keep the faith."" [Laughter] And my grandmother would yell, ""No, Joey, spread it.""
Go spread the faith, guys. We can do this.

2022-02-01 00:00:00,Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Richard J. Durbin and Ranking Member Charles E. Grassley To Discuss the Forthcoming Supreme Court Vacancy,"
The President. Look, I invitedwe're different parties, but two good friends down here. We've done an awful lot of Supreme Court Justices together, Senator Grassley and I, as well as Senator Durbin. And we've worked together on a lot of court nominations overall, but particularly Supreme Court nominees.
And selecting a Justice is one of the President's most serious responsibilities. And as I always saidand I went back and looked at a lot of the opening statements I madeapparently, Dick, I've presided over more Supreme Court Justices than anybody around who's still in Congress or associated with the Government, which iskind of means we must be beyond 60, Chuck. I'm not sure what it is, but we're a little older. But
Ranking Member Grassley. For me, it'd be 15 or 16.
The President. [Laughter] Yes, well, and I started way back early on in the early seventies.
At any rate, what we're going to do, as I've said beforeand I went back and looked at some of the opening statements that I made for Justices over the years that, you know, it'sthe Constitution says advise and consent""advice and consent."" And I'm serious when I say it: that I want the advice of the Senate as well as the consent, if we can arrive on who the nominee should be.
And you know, it'sthere's always a renewed national debate every time we nominateany President nominates a Justice, because the Constitution is always evolving slightly in terms of additional rights or curtailing rights, et cetera. And it's always an issue. And there's several schools of thought in terms of judicial philosophy. And we'll see.
But the fact is that I'm looking for someone who I canthis is not a static issue; it flows back and forth. What I'm looking for is a candidate with character; with the qualities of a judge, in terms of being courteous to the folks before them and treating people with respect; as well as a judicial philosophy that is more one that suggests that there are unenumerated rights in the Constitution and all the amendments mean something, including the Ninth Amendment.
Andbut I intend to take this decisionto make this decision and get it to my colleagues by the end of the month. That's my hope. And I'm looking forward to their advice in how to proceed and how the hearings will be conducted and the like.
So thank you very much. We're going to get a chance to talk. I want to hear from them today.
Thank you.

Ukraine/Russia 
President Biden. Well Ilet me start by saying a few wordsbefore I talk about our guestabout Russia and Ukraine. I'veI had a productive talk last week with President Zelenskiy. And we continue to engage in nonstop diplomacy and to deescalate tensions and attempt like the devil to improve security for our allies and partners and for all of Europe for that matter.
And today, in the United Nations, we've laid out the full nature of Russia's threat to Ukraine's sovereignty and the territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as the core tenants of a rule-based international order. And we continue to urge diplomacy as the best way forward. But with Russia continuing its buildup of its forces around Ukraine, we are ready no matter what happens.
United Arab Emirates 
I also want to note that the U.A.E. defeated a ballistic missile attack launched by the Houthisa separate issuefrom Yemen yesterday. And we've been in daily contact with the U.A.E. to address those threats.
And I've directed Secretary Austin to do everything he can to communicate the support of the United States for the U.A.E., Saudi Arabia, and throughout the Gulf region. America will have the backs of our friends in the region.
Qatar-U.S. Relations 
Todaybut I'm honored to be here with a good friend, who has been wonderfulrelationship since I've been President and before. The Sheikh isI want to welcome you to the White House.
Amir Tamim. Thank you.
President Biden. Fifty years of partnership. You're not that old, but 50 years of partnership. And this past year, our partnership with Qatar washas been central to many of our most vital interests: relocating tens of thousands of Afghans; maintaining stability in Gaza and providing lifesaving assistance to the Palestinians; keeping pressure on ISIS and deterring threats across the Middle East; and a lot more.
And the Amir and I have a lot on our agenda today, and we want to talk about the security in the Gulf and in the broader Middle East, ensuring the stability of global energy supplies, continuing our work together to support the people of Afghanistan, and strengthening commercial and investment cooperation between our two countries.
And speaking of that, on that front, I want to applaud the new deal that Qatar Airways Group signed with Boeing for 20a $20 billion deal, one of the largest deals that Boeing aircraft has ever had. And it will support tens of thousands of good-paying U.S. jobs here in America.
Qatar is a good friend and a reliable and capable partner. And I'm notifying Congress that I will designate Qatar as a ""major non-NATO ally"" to reflect the importancethe importanceof our relationship. I think it's long overdue.
And I want to thank you again, Your Highness, for being here and for making this tripfor you, for your commitment to our friendship and between our nations. And I'm looking forward to our discussion today.
Amir Tamim. Well, thank you very much, Mr. President. Good afternoon to everyone. I'm very happy to be here, Mr. President. Two-thousand-twenty-two is a very important year. It marks the 50th anniversary of our diplomatic relationship between Qatar and the United States of America. It's a very strong relationship, and we're very proud about it. We are very proud of what we have achieved.
Of course, this afternoon I'm going to be talking with the President about different topics, mainly about the security of our region. I think we demonstrated thathow solid and how strong we can work together and cooperateon what we did in Afghanistan. We are very proud that we managed to evacuate tens of thousands of people inof Afghanistan.
Of course, we have other issues as well that we're going to talk about: the equal rights of the Palestinian people and other issues in the region.
So, you know, we're very happy and proud of this great relationship. And we're going to continue working together to find ways and means to bring peace in our region.
So thank you very much for, you know, seeing me today, Mr. President. And as you mentioned, that we'll be talking about several topics.
President Biden. Welcome.
Amir Tamim. Thank you, sir.
President Biden. Welcome.

2022-01-31 00:00:00,Remarks in a Meeting With the National Governors Association,"
[Vice President Kamala D. Harris made introductory remarks, concluding as follows.]
Vice President Harris. And I will now introduce the President of the United States of America, Joe Biden.
The President. Well, thanks. Thank you very much. Look, I'm going to[applause]thank you.
Governors, it's truly to have ait's a pleasure to have you all here. And I'm glad you're having an opportunityand my Cabinet and overall team is getting a chance to meet you all and know you personally, and engage with you on thegreat concern that you have.
You know, theI had a chance to hear from several leaders of my administration this morning, including former Governors. If you noticed, I hired a lot of Governors and mayors because they know how to get things done. And you have two Governors, sitting to my left here, who are taking on major, major responsibilities.
I remember, when we were out on the trail, Governor Vilsack telling me that the first industry in the world that was going to have net-zero emissions is going to be agriculture, and he was right. At the time, it was a fairly novel idea, but a lot of you picked it up and moved beyond.
And I know thatlook, the American Rescue Plan was a lot of money. And it was designed to make sure we could carry the Nation forward in dealing with vaccines, boosters, or creating jobs and keeping schools open and a number of other things.
And, Gov, you said send you money. We have. [Laughter] We've sent you a whole hell of a lot of money. And we're going to send you more if you keep using it as well as you have.
And we're talking about the ability toreally, the way I look at itand I mean this sincerely, and I've said it last night in a more casual way: We are at an inflection point. And we have an opportunity toAmerica is one of those nationsI think the only nationthat's come out of every crisis stronger than it went into the crisis. And I'm not beingit's not hyperbole. We have had a crisis. We've come out. We've been stronger.
And I think that's where we are again. And I think we have a chance to sort of restate and reassert our world leadership on a whole range of issues and lead the world on everything from the environment to dealing with the issues of immigration, a whole range of issues, Gov.
Andbut the American Rescue Plan gives us the resources to do many of those things. And, you know, there's a lot of challenges out there that we're not even talking to directly; today, there's so many. But the surge of gun violence since the start of this pandemic.
I made it clear we should use these funds to combat violent crime as well, including hiring additional police officers and investing in community violence interventions that have been proven to work in communities. And I know you're making those investments in Michigan. I know you're making those investments in New Jersey. You're making those investments in Ohio. A lot of you are making them all over the country.
Another one of the national challenges: We need to bring back workers to better jobs with better pay and better working conditions than the ones that they left. The American Rescue Plan, there wasa major part was $350 billion to allocate to your States and local budgets, as well as funds for school and for childcare. And we know the difference this has made in jobs. Last year, we had the greatest job growth in American history. And as part of that, State and local jobs grew by 464,000, the most in 20 years.
And, Governor of Hawaii, you've workedyou've talked about the 10,000 State workers that areyou're able to keep on the job thanks to the American Rescue Plan. I'm not sure where you're sitting, but any rate. There you are, Gov. Sorry.
And I know that the education funds helped many of you stay open, keep your schools open, and keep them open safely. There's a lot of money you have there for everything from dealing with ventilation to clean busesschool buses and everything in between. There's no reason why we can't keep our schools open, in my view.
And getting kids to school was an essential step getting our economy back to normal. And we're not quite there yet. But we also know that if people find they can afford childcare, they get back to work as well.
I think we're going to be coming back to you. There's one reason why there's 1.2 million women who were working, who are not in the job market now, because it's hard to get back and the combination of worrying about, is school open, as well as whether or not there'sthe cost of childcare. In 43 of your States, you've already gotten relief, with 150,000 childcare providers to help many of them keep their doors open, and at a critical timethe actual physical facilities.
And now we need it even more to get Americanskeep them at work and the essential workers on the job. And that can mean, as some of you used, hero retention bonuses, higher pay, temporary paid leave to combat burnout in essential health care workers, like Delaware, Illinois, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania have all announced. It can mean paid leave, as is being done in the State of Washington.
But to keep schools open, to keep kids in school, to make up for learning losses, we need to bring back more teachers, more tutors, bus drivers, school nurses. And we're seeing creative efforts in North Carolina, for example, which is providing bonuses for all school employees, and Arkansas, as you know, Gov, which is creating a Tutoring Corps.
And we're seeing States like Kansas and New Jersey and Nevada using funds to expand the pool of counselors and mental health care workers in our schools, which are badly needed, in my view.
And already 27 States have announced they're using over $14 billion in the American Rescue Plan funds to get a head start on rebuilding our Nation's infrastructure. As you said, Gov, you know how to build roads and bridges. Well, we've got a hell of a lot to build, and we're going to build a bunch of them. And also clean water and ports and a whole range of things. We have a lot of opportunity to build back a lot better.
And I think it's really importantit's equally important to make sure we have a well-trained and diverse workforce ready to fill the jobs and careers that my infrastructure lawour infrastructure law is going to help open up wide. And that means using the Rescue Plan funds to support union-based apprenticeships, community college partnerships, on-the-job training in key areas like advanced manufacturing and clean energy, which some of you are doing, and construction. And we're seeing States like Wisconsin, Colorado, Connecticut, North Carolina, Maine, Massachusetts all doing that already.
We have dozens of examples of how important the creative work that is underway as a result ofand we're providing a hell of a lot more flexibility that you all required. I think we've done that. If you haven't, I'd like to hear it today if you don't have enough flexibility.
It's good work you're doing. It is a good start. And we need you to do even more to retain, train, and hire workers. We need to serve our people and expand our economy.
And so, because ofthis is chance for us to not only come together and get through this pandemic, it's a chance for us to come through it stronger and ready to build on our progress and deal more Americans in to win the competition of the future.
We are doing better than any nationany major nation in the world. We've got to keep thatwe've got to pick it up. And I can think of no better group of people to pick it up with. It takes State leaders, Federal, business, labor.
I've notI've never seen as much cooperation that is across the board. There's differences, I know. But there's been a hell of a lot of cooperation across the board, including business and labor pulling together, accelerating efforts, and trying to do a lot more to make sure we get out of this hole.
And so, I want to thank you all for being here. And I know you spoke today with the CDC. You hadnot the CDC, but you had the head of my COVID team in here. We've got a way to go on that, in my view, but we're moving. And so, I think it's all about making sure we have the same standards we're applying across the board.
And, you know, as you said, Gov, we're going to try like the devil to keep schools open. Because we do knowstudy after study, as all of you know and you've done; the great universities in your States have done themis that, you know, losing a semester can put a kid back a year and a half. And so, there's a whole lot we canhave to do, in my view, to focus. And I think that keeping schools open is a big part of that.
And border securityGov, we're working a lot with the neighboring countries. A lot to dothere's a lot. I think one of the fundamental things we've got to do in addition to some of the changes we'll makewe won't get into it todaybut is that if we figure out why they're leaving in the first place.
It's not like people sit around and say, in Guadalajara: ""I've got a great idea. Let's sell everything we have, give it to a coyote to take us across the border and leave us in the desert in a country that doesn't want us, where we don't speak the language. Won't that be fun?""
You know, there are gangs we're working on. There is a whole lot of illegal movement. But there's also a way to begin to deal with the reason they're leaving in the first place. And I'llwe can get intoI'd love to talk with you personally about that a little bit, if I may.
But having said that, why don't I stop and take any questions you all may have. And they tell me I'm supposed to call on Governor Cox first.

2021-12-06 00:00:00,Remarks on Prescription Drug Costs and an Exchange With Reporters,"
The President. Iesha, thank you very much. Your story is important, andfor everyone to hear. And thank God you're with us today.
Today I'd like to talk about how we're going to help millions of Americans protect and preserve their health and live with the dignity of knowing that they can care for themselves and their loved ones, all by making the cost of prescription drugs much more reasonable.
At the outset, I want to be clear: We acknowledge the groundbreaking, lifesaving work that many pharmaceutical companies are doing. Look no further than the vaccines and the treatments they're manufacturing and delivering that are helping fight this pandemic. Our miraculous therapies have, in some cases, turned diseases that were once considered death sentences into treatable conditions.
But we can make a distinction between developing those breakthroughs and jacking up prices on a range of medicines, which have been on the market for years without making a substantial and a substantive change in the medication itselfthe medicine itself.
Here in America, it will not surprise you to know that we pay the highest prescription drug prices of any developed nation in the world. Let me say that again: We pay the highesthighestprescription drug prices of any developed nation in the world. That may surprise youwhat may surprise you is, we pay about two to three times what other countries pay for the same drug.
An example: One anticancer drug costs $14,000 in the United States. That same exact drug by the same manufacturer costs $6,000 in France. Today, one in four Americans who take prescription drugs struggle to afford them. Nearly 30 percentnearly 30 percentof these patients have skipped doses of essential drugs they have to take.
Others have simply not fulfilledfilled a prescription, tried to use over-the-counter drug, and cut pills in half, orbecause they can't afford the cost of their prescription.
You know, even if you think this doesn't affect you, it does. Everyone has less money in their pockets because high drug costs make health insurance more expensive for everyone.
There aren't a lot of things that almost every American agreecan agree on. But I think it's safe to say that all of usall of uswhatever our background, our age, where we livewe can agree that prescription drugs are outrageously expensive in this country.
It doesn't need to be that way. Under my Build Back Better bill, there will bewhich has passed the House of Representativesit won't be the same way.
One of the most egregious examples of what's happening with drug prices is regarding the treatment of diabetes and the cost of insulina drug that people with type 1 diabetes need to take throughout their lives to control their diabetes and stay alive.
It was almost exactly 100 years ago that a 14-year-old boy in Canada dying of diabetes became the first person to receive an injection of insulin. Today, one bottle of this lifesaving liquid costs less than $10 to manufacture. But thebut in certain types of insulin, prices increased by 15 percent or more each year for the past decade.
Depending on the nature of someone's type 1 diabetes, the average sticker price for a month's supply of insulin is about $375. But some people, it can be as high as $1,000 a month because they need to take more.
I just met with the two lovely women we see in front of me today here. And Sa'Ra Skipper, who was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at age 5; she has a sister Shelby, who was diagnosed at age 8. She told me that affording insulin has been the challenge of her and her family's entire life. Sometimes, she and her sister rationed doses.
In 2018, Sa'Ra was no longer covered by her parent's policy. Although she was working two jobs, she hadn't met her health care plan's deductible. And insulin was about $1,000 a month's supply for her, so she started sharing her sister's insulin from the same vial.
At one point, because Shelby thought Sa'Ra had taken her dose, that Shelby cut a dose in half because the bottle was sitting there, and it would look like it was half empty. Is that correct?
Center Township, IN, resident Sa'Ra Skipper. Yes.
The President. And at that time, she thought, ""Well, I""guess what?""I guess I""she hadn't taken it yet. Shelby had to be hospitalized, as a consequence, for 4 days. Working two jobs, sharing insulin from the same vialin America? Shame on us as a nation if we can't do better than this.
Sa'Ra is about to start a new job and doesn't yet know what the insulin will cost. Sa'Ra has said, ""I wish I could""and this is a quote""I wish I could make a decision that didn't include diabetes."" She shouldn't have to ask such a question.
You know, I think about what just happened with Iesha, who was diagnosed with diabetes 3 days before her 21st birthday, having to choose between rent and groceries and medication. Quote, ""Relentlessly, without relief, every day,"" was your quote to me. Having to ration her supply and feeling herself, as she says, ""slowly dying,"" she ended up in a coma.
Think about that: The difference between nearly dying and thriving is the cost of one drug. Sa'Ra and Iesha are far, far from being alone. It's estimated that 34 million Americans10 percent of the populationhave diabetes, including more than 1.5 million who have type 1 diabetes, requiring daily doses of insulin in varying quantities.
Remember all of this stress, hardship, suffering, and sacrifice is due to a drug that costs just a few bucks to make. One study found that Americans pay 10 times as much as other countries for insulin. These price increases are about companies looking to maximize profits and nobody standing up for the patients, nobody with the power to do something about it.
It's enough. Enough. Nobody has held the manufacturingthe manufacturers accountable, until now. My Build Back Better bill takes three key steps to lower the costs for families dealing with diabetes.
First, we're going to cap cost-sharing offor insulin at $35 per month. That means you can't get charged more than 35 bucks at a pharmacy counter for your insulin. That's across the board, whether you get health insurance through your private policy, the Affordable Care Act Marketplace, or through Medicaid. Nobody is going to pay more than $35 each month for insulin.
Second, for people who don't have health insurance, we're helping you get insurance. That way, people with diabetes can get protected with that $35 copay cap. People who are uninsured today can visit healthcare.gov to check out the options. In many cases, people can get a full health care plan, including coverage for insulin and other prescription drugs, doctor's visits, and hospitalizations for less than $10 a month if you sign up for the plan.
If you live in a State that has refused to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, my Build Back Better bill is going to fix that as well. These changes are going to ensure access to affordable coverage for millions more Americans and help more people with diabetes get the coverage they desperately need.
Third, we're going to end the days when drug companies could increase their prices with no oversight and no accountability. Going forward, drug companies that increase their prices faster than inflation are going to face a steep excise tax. In other words, if you're saying to drugwe're saying to drug companies: If you're finally doing it becauseto be accountable, when your prices to the American people go up, you're going to be accountable.
This is important not only from a health standpoint, but the standpoint of personal dignity. Imagine if you're a parent of one of the roughly 200,000 young people in this country that suffer from type 1 diabetes. Imagine if you can't afford their insulin. It's not only a risk to your child's life, it deprives you of your dignity.
Just imagine, as a parent having a child with Type 1 diabetes and not a damn thing you can do about making sure they have it. You've sold what you can sold. You don't have the money to get it done. Well, my plan addresses an additional fear patients [parents]* face, which is that when their children are starting their careers and are no longer eligible on their parent's health care plan, they'll be able to get the insulin they need.
Outrageous costs affecting everyone across the board, spanning every kind of condition and disease. I remember what it was like when my momfor my mom when she got older and moved in with us. Her prescription drugs were thousands of dollars on a monthly basis. Fortunately, I had three other siblings, and we collectively had the means to chip in so she didn't have to exhaust all of her savings and sell whatever she had left to make sure she could get her drug costs covered.
So I'm committedI'm committedto using every tool I have to lower prescription drug costs for Americans, consistent with the drug companies getting a fair return on their investment.
To really solve this problem, we need the Senate to follow the House of Representatives' lead and pass my Build Back Better bill. In addition to the specific progress that the Build Back Better bill is going to make for families facing diabetes, it will also take the additional step of lowering drug costs for people on Medicare.
Right now the only thing Medicare areis not allowed to negotiatethey can negotiate the cost of doctor's visits, hospitalization, and all the rest. But the one thing they can't, as a matter of law, they are not allowed to negotiate the price for prescription drugs. For everything elsedoctor's visits, crutchesthey can negotiate.
My plan gets rid of that prohibition. What I'm proposing is that we negotiate a fair priceone that reflects the cost of research and development and a need for significant progressexcuse me, need for significant profit, but that is still affordable for consumers. Right now drug companies will set the price at whatever the market will bear.
My plan also caps the amount that seniors on Medicare have to spend on prescription drugs each year to no more than $2,000 per year, with Medicaid [Medicare]* and drug companies picking up the rest of the cost. And, again, our plan says that any drug company can only raise prices based on the rate of inflation and caps insulin cost-sharing at $35 a month.
So let me close with this: I've long said health care should be a right, not a privilege, in this country. And the women I've met with today, and millions like them, are the reason why: people for whom the cost of one drug is the difference between hope and fear, life and death, dignity and dependence.
We're closer than ever to passing my Build Back Better bill and providing people suffering from diabetes and so many other diseases the medicines they need and the dignity they deservebeing able to afford them.
This is not a partisan issue. Diabetes, Alzheimer's, cancer, so many other diseases, they don't care if you're a Democrat or a Republican. This is not whetherit's not about whether or not your loved ones can afford a prescription drug you need. So we need Congress to finish the job, to come together and make a difference in people's lives.
I want to thank both the guests here today for being so straightforward with me. We had a good conversation in the office before coming over here. I admire you both. I admire you both.
And as my grandpop used to say, with the grace of God and the good will of the neighbors, we're going to get this done so you don't have to worry every single day about what you're going to be able to do.
God bless you all, and God protect our troops. Thank you so much.

2021-12-05 00:00:00,Remarks at the Kennedy Center Honors Reception,"
The President. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And welcome to the White House.
This is what you call a family affair. Please be seated. Please be seated. All our families are here, including the Kennedy family, who is part of the family. God love them.
Jill and Ifor us, when Barack and Michelle hosted us at this reception, it was one of our favorite events. And now, with Kamala and Doug, and to host the Kennedy Center honorees once again in the White House: We welcome everybody back.
And if you'll excuse a point of personal privilegeas we used to say in the Senate: My good friend David Rubenstein in the front rowthat's really important, but he'sthe most important thing is he's sitting next to my sister Valerie. [Laughter] And[laughter]. Hey, Val.
And, Deborah Rutter, thank you, and members of the Board and all the supporters of the Kennedy Center.
It's wonderful to see Speaker Pelosi. I'm mildly prejudiced: I think she's the finest Speaker in the history of the country. A true, genuine champion of the arts. A true, genuine champion of the arts.
And a heartfelt welcome back to our dear friend, Caroline Kennedy. Caroline, Madam Ambassador, you know how much our family loves your family and how much, in times of difficulty early onbefore I had this jobI relied on your family for help and moral support. I really mean it. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I think about your parents and your uncles often.
And look, on this night in particular, I'd like to thank President and Mrs. Kennedy's love for the arts. In April of 1962, there's asitting here in the East Room wereRobert Frost and other Nobel laureates were being honored for their lives' work in service, understanding human nature and the human condition as only artists can.
It was just a month before President Kennedy presented Robert Frost with the Congressional Gold Medal in the Roosevelt Room and gifting a copy of the, quote, ""the Clearing."" And you know, a great American poet joked that President Kennedy had a, quote, niche of ""Irish weakness in the arts"" [""nice Irish weakness for the arts""].* Well, what can I say is: I think all the Irish do. I don't have as much as others, because I'm not as sophisticated, but that's the Irish of it.
You know, in October, I had the honor of meeting Pope Francis at the Vatican and marking the progress when the only openly Catholic President was able to openly befriendthe second Catholic to be the only one able to befriend the Pope without it causing a great international stir. When President Kennedy was elected, he could not.
Pope Francis and I met for about 90 minutes. As a matter of fact, the consiglieres of thekept saying, ""Is this finished yet? Is it finished yet?"" [Laughter] Actually, it went on about almost 2 hours. And we were talking about a range of issues.
And it was one of those most meaningful meetings of my career. But there is something else at the Vatican that's moving for me and for millions of visitors. When you walk into the Sistine Chapelas you've all probably haveand look up at the heavens and you see Michelangelo's masterpiece, and it takes your breath away. It reminds me of Michelangelo's famous words, when he said, ""I saw the angel in the marble, and I carved it until I could set him free."" I saw the angel in the marble, and I carved it until I could set him free.
That's an artist's gift. That's the gift you all give us. It's that sixth sense to imagine something no one else canto carve, to paint, to write, to dance, to sing, to dream until you set the vision free. That's what you do. I don't even think you fully appreciate what you do for so many people. Tonight we celebrate that gift and another extraordinary group of artists here in the White House.
To all of the Kennedy Center honorees past and present, thank you for sharing your gift with the Nation and forand with the world. And that includes honorees who are no longer with us, like the incomparable Stephen Sondheim who just passed away. Stephen was in a class of his own as a composer and a lyricist. And he once wrote: No one lovesexcuse me, ""No one leaves for good."" No one leaves for good. Like every iconic artist, his work is going to endure and be discovered and rediscovered for generations to come, just like the work of all of you here.
In the spring, Jill and I had the pleasure of hosting last year's honoree's: Joan Baez, Garth Brooks, Dick Van Dyke, Debbie Allen, MiyorI think I left somebody out. But at any rate, I apologize if I did. Andexcuse me, Midori is who I left out. And Debbie is here tonight.
Jill and I met them as ordinary fans. And we did so as President and First Lady, recognizing how it touches and reveals the soul of America. I mean, you are thein a sense, the face of America. You'reyou're the ones that most people associate with who we are as a country. And that's what this year's honorees have done throughout their groundbreaking careers.
And Justino Diaz, a proud son of Puerto Rico and one of the world's legendary opera singers who gives us the sound of soul, a 4-decade career, dozens of roles, and hundreds of performances.
From the stages of the world's biggest opera houses, his defining baritone makes Shakespeare, Verdi, Puccini, who theyas if they all wrote for him, each of theit's amazing. I don't know whether you feel that way, pal, but that's how it comes across. [Laughter] A voice and a presence that depicts the drama of human experience unlike few others ever have or ever will.
And 50 years ago, Justino performed at the inauguration at the Kennedy Centerof the Kennedy Center. Later this evening he returns with a well-deserved honor. Congratulations, Justino. I think you'reyou deserve it.
And Berry Gordy. Detroit. Motown. [Laughter] God, I tell you what: I don't know how I would have grown up without Motown. [Laughter] Talk about the soul of America. Unmatched 6-decade career, a songwriter and a producer.
Jackie Wilson. Smokey Robinson. Stevie Wonder. The Supremes. The Temptations. The Jackson 5. The list goes on and on. And if I had my cell phone with me, I'd play them all for you. [Laughter] The talent, the singers, writers, producers that found a home in Motown and helped establish Black culture as American culture.
It went wellwaywell beyond the music. And as an Army veteran who served in Korea, only to come back to a segregated America to put up every barrier in your way. But Berry still built one of the most iconic businesses in our history. And he did it with music that lifted us higher and spoke to what we all know in our hearts: that love is in need. And love today is badly needed.
His music inspires us, challenges us, and brought us together, providing that sometimes the best way to shatter the deepest rooted barriers in a country is to get people to move their feet. Motown moved the soul of America because Motown set the beat of America. So I want to thank you, Berry, really. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
You know, Berry, my dad, when he was a kid, had a band. And as he grew up and getting married and had his family, he used to look at me and say, ""Joey, I don't know where the hell you came from."" He said: ""You have two left feet. You can't carry a tune in a wheelbarrow. And, Joey, you have no lip for clarinet."" So he was disappointed. But I wish I had your talentto not be able to do any of that stuff and still make the best music in the world. [Laughter]
And Lorne Michaels, Mr. Wise Guy over here. [Laughter] He's trying out seven guys to play me on the program. [Laughter] As we say in our family: Bless me father for I have sinned. I don't know what's going to happen. [Laughter]
And finally, it's my turn to say something about him. [Laughter] All kidding aside, in over 40 years of turning ""Saturday Night Live"" into an American institution, Lorne has proven that laughter is good for the soul. If you can't laugh at yourself, we're in real trouble. And you make me laugh at myself a lot. [Laughter] Ninety-four Emmy nominations, the most ever for one person in history; 20 wins; 370 [307]* Emmy nominations for SNL, the most of any show; 86 wins.
And like Berry Gordy, he's cultivated talent that's defined American culture in the 20th century and well into the 21st century. Talent like past Kennedy Center honoree Steve Martin, who is here today. Steve, are you here today? I was told youSteve, stand up. Come on, man. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Actor Steve Martin. Do you want me to play you? [Laughter]
The President. Steve, I'm afraid you understand me too well. [Laughter]
Lorne has proven that satire about our leaders, about our society is a quintessential American thing to do and a hallmark of any democratic society. Like good journalism, comedy holds a mirror up to ourselves to reflect on the good, the bad, and the truth. It matters. And our good friend and past Kennedy Center honorees, like David Lettermanwho is hereand understands the truth of that as well. And throughout my career, I've met nearly every world leader. And I'll tell you, not everyone sees satire that way. [Laughter] You'd all be in jail. [Laughter] A joke.
But really, all kidding aside, think about it. But for America, that's the power of our example. You know, I wrote alonga line a long time ago that keeps getting quoted back to me and I make no apologies for it: America has led the world not by the example of our power, but the power of our example. That's who we are. That's what leads the world: the power of example.
And thank you for continuing that great American tradition. I really mean it. Thank you.
And, Bette Midler[applause]God love you. [Laughter] I am such an unadulterated fan. Bette is a true American treasure. You know, it's hard to fully capture the range and breadth of her career and her talents in a span a decade or two.
You know, wein the Biden family, no woman is as old as any man. That's the rule. Okay? [Laughter] So it's hell turning 30, I know. But you'veall you've donethe songs, the shows, the movies. And it can't be done alone. Four Golden Globe awards, three Grammy awards, three Emmy's, two Tony's, two nominations for Oscar, and evenand eventonight's Kennedy Center Honors.
But to paraphrase Maya Angelou: People will never forget how you make them feel. People will never forget how you make them feel. Bette, that's your gift. It's an incredible gift.
Jill was reminding uswe went to see Bette on Broadway when our two boys were a lotwhen my two boys were young. And in the middle of her show, she stopped and looked downwe had great seats and, like, seven, eight rows back. She looks, she said, ""Who would bring two kids to a show like this?"" [Laughter] My boys used that as a badge of courage their entire career. [Laughter] ""Bette Midler picked us out in a show."" [Laughter]
You're a performer without peer, Bette, staying grounded with empathy and just connects with people and all walks of life. You sort of reach down deep, and you grab their souls. You make them feel. You make them laugh. You find joy, and you give them a little bit of hope.
You know, your own stageson your own stagewell, we're just lucky to have you. Just lucky to have you and to watch one of America's greats. I really mean it. You're something else.
And although you weren't thinking of me, but I keep thinking you're thinking of me when you said the wings beneaththe wind beneath my wings. [Laughter] So Iyou know, like I said, I'm going to show you my cell phone in a minute. [Laughter] And congratulations to ""The Divine Miss M""I tell you.
And, Joni, your words and melodies touch the deepest parts of our soul. I meanI mean, they really do. We don'tand thatyour experience, for real. I mean, all that you've done. Our capacity to lovethe capacity to love with abandon. Abandon.
And she does it by letting us in, by sharing what's deeply personal and yet universal. It's why millions of people will listen to her songs and feel they were written just for them. It'syou're a master at your craft.
And what sets you apart, in my view, is when we listen to youyour voice, your guitar, your careful arrangementswe listen to a great song. And thenthenyou read the lyrics on their own, in the quiet, all by themselves, and you read a great poem. You sing poetry, it seems to me. And I'm no artist.
Eight Grammys, seventeen nominations. The album ""Blue"" considered one of the best albums ever, ever, ever. And the impact on fans in every generation and artists of every genre. This is immeasurable.
Her giftshe touches the range of human nature and the sense of struggle and how we overcome and how we love. Joni, congratulations. Congratulations[inaudible].
And I can see Jill. Pretty soon, Jill is going to be sitting on that front row going
[At this point, the President made a gesture across his throat often used to indicate that someone should stop speaking.]
[Laughter] But I'm really excited about this group. To the five honorees tonight and to your families, thank you. And their families are here.
As a group, in your own ways, you've brought people together. You've made us laugh. You've made us cry. You've made us sing. You've made us dance. And generations of families have shared the love of your work. And our Nation is stronger, more dynamic, and more vibrant because of you.
You know, I won't go into it, but as I've been in and out of Afghanistan and Iraq over 27 times, I think, and going to these war zonesto be up in the Kunar Valleyand you'd hear your music being played by our servicemen, for real. For real. In the dining halls, in theI mean, it's justthere's somethingand that's something to remember today.
This is afor this pandemic of profound loss and pain, as we move forward toward repair and renewal, the artist's vision is important as it ever has been. I would argue more important. The search for greater meaning in our lives and the lives of the Nationwe've seen the power of art in every form to heal, to comfort, and recover. And as part of a great tradition in our country, Jill and I, Kamala and Doug are going to continue to celebrate and appreciate and support the critical roles that artists play in our Nation.
As Vice President, I was here in the groundbreaking for the Kennedy Center expansion to broaden its cultural impact. As the Kennedy Center celebrates its 50th anniversary, as President, my administration looks forward to working with it and the arts and cultural organizations across America, in big cities and small towns, to make more accessible for people of every age and background, what's thereto lift up more voices, to inspire and support the next generation of artists and creators, and to tell the full story of Americaa story of the power of our example as a great nation, because we are a good people with artists who carve angels from marble to set them free.
So congratulations again. Enjoy tonight's show. And have a safe holiday season.
May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you.

2021-12-03 00:00:00,Remarks on the Bureau of Labor Statistics Report on the Employment Situation in November and an Exchange With Reporters,"
The President. Good morning. Before I start, I'd like to report that later today, I'll be signing the bill funding the Government operations for the next few months.
Funding the government isn't a great achievement. [Laughter] It's a bare minimum of what we need to get done. But in these times, a bipartisan cooperation is worth recognition, so I want to thank Senators Schumer and McConnell and Speaker Pelosi for getting this done.
And I want to thank the substantial bipartisan vote in the Senate for sending this bill to my desk today to avoid disruption of Government operations. And I want to urge Congress to use the time this bill provides to work toward a bipartisan agreement on a full-year funding bill that makes the needed investments in our economy and our people, from public health, to education, to national security.
Now, for today's news. Every year, December brings the joys of the holiday season and gives us an opportunity to reflect on the year gone by and look ahead and begin to imagine the new year to come.
This year, we can reflect on some extraordinary bit of progress. Our economy is markedly stronger than it was a year ago. And today the incredible news that our unemployment rate has fallen to 4.2 percent. At this point in the year, we're looking at the sharpest 1-year decline in unemployment ever. Simply put, AmericaAmericais back to work, and our jobs recovery is going very strong.
Today's historic drop in unemployment rate includes dramatic improvements for workers who have often seen higher wages and higher levels of unemploymentexcuse me, higher levels of unemployment. They are receiving higher wages. And the rate of Black and Hispanic unemployment is also dropping sharply.
But that's not just jobs that are up. Wages are up, especially for hard-working Americans often ignored in the pastin past recoveries. Workers in transportation and warehouses have seen their wages go up approximately 10 percent this year. Workers in hotels and restaurants have seen their wages go up 13 percent this year.
And thanks to the American Rescue Plan, we've delivered significant tax cuts to families raising children. Tax cuts and rising wages for middle class families mean that Americans, on average, have more in their pockets today than they did eachin each month since we've been in office than they did last year after accounting for inflation. Let me repeat that: Even after accounting for rising prices, the typical American family has more money in their pockets than they did last year.
In fact, we're the only leading economy in the world where household income and the economy as a whole are stronger than they were before the pandemic.
Applications for new small businesses are up 30 percent compared to before the pandemic. Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, we're cutting child poverty in America by more than 40 percent. And millions of children who spent last Christmas in poverty will not bear that burden this holiday season.
Today's news means that the unemployment rate has now fallen by more than 2 percentage points since I took office. That's the fastest decline in a single year on record. And it's about three times faster than any other President in their first year in office. The number of people claiming unemployment has fallen from 18 million when mytook office, to 2 million this week, another record drop.
We've also learned today that in November, 235,000 jobs were created in the private sector. And when they went back and recalibrated, they foundthe last 2 monthsthey found that job growth over the prior 2 months, September and October, actually created 82,000 more jobs than had previously been reported, which means that we've averaged nearly 400,000 new jobs a month over the last 3 months, a solid pace.
All told, in the first 10 full months of my administration, the economy has created 6 million jobs, a record for a new President. This is a significant improvement from when I took office in January, a sign that we're on the right track.
Because of the extraordinary strides we've made, we can look forward to a brighter, happier new year ahead, in my view. But I also know that despite this progress, families are anxious. They're anxious about COVID. They're anxious about the cost of living and the economy more broadly. They're still uncertain. I want you to know: I hear you. It's not enough to know that we're making progress. You need to see it and feel it in your own lives and around the kitchen table and in your checkbooks.
And that is why, every day, my team and I are working to deliver consistent, determined, focused action to overcome the challenges we still face. Now, chief among those challenges is COVID-19. Yesterday I laid out the key actions we're going to take this winter to fight this virus, to protect one another, to protect our economy and our economic recovery.
They include: number one, expanding our nationwide booster campaign with more outreach, more appointments, and more hours. I was thrilled to see that yesterday we had more vaccine shots administered than any day in the past 6 months.
Number two, we're launching hundreds of new family vaccination clinics to make it easier for children and parents, the whole family to get vaccinated in one place; and new policies to keep children in school instead of quarantining them at home when someone in the class comes down with COVID, if they do.
Thirdly, making free at-home tests more available than ever before by having them covered by our private health insurance plans. The availability of community health centers and other sites for the uninsured will be the alternative as well. So, if you have insurance, you're going to beit will cover these tests. And if you don't have insurance, we have facilities you can attend and get these tests.
Increasing our surge response is the fourth thingour Surge Response Teams. They're made up of doctors and nurses and medical staff who go into communities with rising cases and provide the needed staff for overrun hospitalsfor their emergency rooms, their intensive care unitsto get help to them as they need it. And we're about tripling the number of those surge teams.
Acceleratefifth, we're accelerating our efforts to vaccinate the rest of the world and strengthening international travel rules for people coming into the United States. This is a plan all Americans can rally behind, in my view.
We're also addressing another concern for families: prices. Just about every country is grappling with high prices right now as they fight the pandemic. As the world economy continues to come back to life, the more price pressures are going to ease as things begin to move.
But we're not sitting around waiting. In the meantime, I've used every tool available to address price increases, and it's beginning to work. Take gasoline and gas prices. Last week, I announced the largest ever release from the United States Strategic Petroleum Reserve to increase the supply of oil and help bring down prices.
And I brought together other countriesIndia, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the United Kingdomwho all agreedall agreed to join me in releasing additional oil from their reserves. And China may very do welldo more as well. They haven't done it yet.
This worldwide effort we're leading won't solve the problem of high gas prices overnight. But over the last month, likely due in part to the anticipation of this action, we've seen oil and gas prices out of the wellsoil and gas prices on the wholesale market come down significantly.
Since the end of October
[At this point, the President cleared his throat.]
Excuse methe average weekly price of gasoline on the wholesale marketthat's what you sell to the gas stationshas fallen around 10 percent, and that decline has picked up in recent days. That's a drop of about 25 cents per gallon. These savings are beginning to reach Americans, and should pick up in the weeks ahead. And it can't happen fast enough.
And I've asked the Federal Trade Commission to consider whether potentially illegal and anticompetitive behavior in the oil and gas industry is causing higher prices for consumers when they don't need to be that high because the wholesale price has come down so much. So we can ensure that the American people are paying a fair price for gas.
At this time of the year, another concern that is facing American families is about being able to find what you need in the holidays, whether it's gifts or groceries. As I laid out earlier in the week, because of my actionsthe actions that my administration has taken, in partnership with businessexcuse me
[The President cleared his throat.]
with private business and labor, retailers and grocery stores, freight movers and railroads, these shelves are going tothe shelves of our stores are going to well stocked.
We've sped up operations at our ports. For example, at the Port of Los Angeles and Long Beachthe two busiest ports in Americaover the last month, the number of containers left sitting on the docks for over 8 days is down by 40 percent.
I've said that before, and people have come up to me and said: ""Well that does that mean? So they're down 40 percent."" [Laughter] Well, it means that the products are no longer sitting on the docks; they're getting off the docks into trains, into trucks, into vehicles to get them to the stores' shelves. And this is an incredible success story.
On Monday, I convened a group of CEOs from some of the largest retailers and grocery stores, as well as leading companies that works with small businesses across the country. And they reported that their investments [inventories]* are up, shelves are well stocked, and they're ready to meet consumer demand for the holidays.
Now, I said that yesterday, and then I saw a couple of your stations put onyou found some empty shelves. [Laughter] They're old empty shelves, but it doesn't matter. But go back, and take a look at some of those shelves again. Okay?
But the point is that the vast majority of the shelves are filled, and the CEOs of not only the suppliers, but the CEOs of UPS and FedEx, which are on track to deliver more packages than ever, are saying the same thing.
So we're heading into the holiday season in strong shape. Again, this is about a concerted, focused action. We averted this potential crisis by figuring out what needed to be fixed, and then we brought together the people that have the capacity to fix it or at least alleviate it.
Nownowit's time to build on the success we've had this year on jobs, wages, creation of more small businesses, and fixing challenges in the economy. We need to cut costs further for families. That's what my Build Back Better plan does that's still being considered in Congress. It will lower the out-of-pocket cost for childcare, eldercare, housing, college, health care, and prescription drugs.
In fact, a new independent analysis released this week showed that my plan would mean $7,400 in tax cuts and savings for the typical family of four with two children. Seventeen Nobel Prize winners in economics have written a letter to me, affirming that this bill would reduce long-term inflationary pressures in the economy.
And two of the leading rating agenciesnot, you know, liberal think tankstwo of the leading rating agencies on Wall Street confirmed this month that my plan will not add to inflationary pressures.
What I've always proposed and what I'm proposing now is having a way to lower some of the most difficult costsand what are they?the difficult costs families pay every month by asking corporations and the wealthiest Americansincluding, for example, the 55 corporations that paid zero in Federal income tax last year, despite generating $40 billion in profits; and I'm happy they're profitableto begin to pay their fair share.
For example, just requiring corporations to pay a minimum 15 percent in taxes raises enough revenue to pay for lowering the cost of childcare for 90 percent of families and provides universal preschool for three- and fourall 3- and 4-year-olds in America.
Now, what's better for those corporations? Is it better for them having childcare so parents can come back to work today, and they have a better educated workforce in the future or havingnot paying any tax?
Once again, no oneno onemaking less than $400,000 a year will pay a penny more in federal taxes. My Build Back Better plan is fiscally responsible. It's the first major piece of legislation in more than a decade that's not only fully paid for, but will generate more than $100 billion in deficit reduction this decade.
It fully covers the cost of its investments by making the largest corporations and richest Americans pay a little more in taxes. I think that's a trade-off that's worth making. And by the way, those very business are going to do better having a better educated and more available workforce. Having those who've done very well pay their fair share is just the right thing to do in order to provide a little breathing room for millions of American families.
Throughout our history, we've emerged from crisis by investing in ourselves. And so, we're going to keep at this. We're going to keep making progress for our families and for our nation.
I promise you that's what's going to happen. God bless you all. And may God protect our troops and keep everyone safe.
Q. Mr. President, Mr. President
[Several reporters began speaking at once.]
Q. What is happening in Ukraine?
Q. Mr. President, are vaccines
Q. Are you going to be 
The President's Health 
Q. First of all, Mr. President, your voice sounds a little different. Are you okay?
The President. I'm okay. I have a test every day to seea COVID test. Ithey check me for all the strains. What I have is a 1-year-old grandson who had a cold, who likes to kiss his Pop. [Laughter] And he'd been kissing myanyway, sobut it's just a cold.
Coronavirus Prevention Efforts/Global Vaccination Efforts 
Q. And then so, on COVID policy, it seems like the administration is starting to soften some of the language. There's this new op-ed where you talk about COVID and ""We're going to beat it back."" Are you no longer going to ""shut it down""?
The President. No, well, we've got to beat it back before we shut it down. Look, it's going to take time worldwide. In order to beat COVID, we have to shut it down worldwide. In the United States of America, we're doing everything that needs to be done to take care of the American people within our borders.
But look what's happened. You know, we were starting to make some real progress, and then you find out there's another strain. And the idea that you can build a wall around America to keep any COVID from around the world out is not thenot there.
And besides, that's one of the reasons whyI know we get criticizedI get criticized for not doing more for the world. But we've done more for the world in providing vaccines available and help than any nationallevery other nation in the world combined.
In addition to thatin addition to that, we've alsowith regard to India and other countriesand we're working around the clock. Remember, I suggested we suspend the patents, let everybody be able to have access to this so they can make the vaccine in their own countries.
And thirdly, in Southern Africafor example, South Africa has all the vaccines they need; they don't want any more vaccines now. One of the things I'm considering is how can we help them deal with the issue of theas I said before, the biggest challenge we had in the beginning of this administration, in my view, was not getting the vaccines producedalthough that was not easy, and I've got to giveyou know, President Trump, early on, went out and tried tohe got them to do the research to try to get the right vaccines.
But logisticallylogisticallygetting the vaccines from a container that gets delivered to you, to a hospital, to a State, to aand getting it in someone's armsthat's a very, very difficult thing. And we did it better than anybody in the world has done it. But we've got to try to help other people.
Q. Mr. President, on vaccinesMr. President
Coronavirus Omicron Variant/U.S. Travel Restrictions 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Given that there are now multiple cases of Omicron here in the U.S., are you considering requiring vaccines for domestic travel or any other new measures for domestic travel?
The President. The measures that I announced yesterday arewe believe are sufficient to deal with the proper medical precautions to deal with the spread of this new variant. We are doing, as you knowat NIH, as well as among the manufacturersa lot of research to see the extent of itshow quickly it spreads, how deadly it is, et cetera, et cetera.
But we do require for travelwe're going to continue to require people to have masks onmasks onand in public places, and soand Federal buildings. Sobut I don't, at this point, becauselet meI think I know a fair amount about this issue. But I'm not a scientist, so I continue to rely on the scientists and asking them whether or not we have to move beyond what we did yesterday. Right now they're saying ""no.""
Q. Quick follow-up, quick follow-up
Q. On vaccines, on vaccines
[Several reporters spoke at once.]
Q. Mr. President
Ukraine 
Q. What is happening in Ukraine, and whaton the border between Ukraine and Russia? And what are you going to do about it?
The President. I have been in constant contact with our allies in Europe, with the Ukrainians. My Secretary of State and National Security Adviser have been engaged extensively.
And what I am doing is putting together what I believe to be will be the most comprehensive and meaningful set of initiatives to make it very, very difficult for Mr. Putin to go ahead and do what people are worried he may do.
But that's in play right now. Thank you.

2021-12-02 00:00:00,Remarks on Lighting the National Christmas Tree,"
My name is Joe Biden. I am Jill Biden's husband. [Laughter] On behalf of Jill and Kamala and Doug, we welcome you to the National Christmas Tree Lighting.
Thanks to the Interior Secretary, Deb Haaland, for that introduction and her leadership. She has made me look awful good in my judgments. It is wonderful to join you here on your birthday, Madam Secretary. Happy birthday.
Also thanks to the National Park Service and the Foundation that takes such great care of our national parks and the 1,300 students around the country who created the ornaments that decorate the trees representing our States and our Territories.
And a special thanks to tonight's host, LL Cool J. I'll tell you what, man, he looks like he can still play. And I'm not talking about instruments; I'm talking about football or something. That man isanyway, I tell you what. [Laughter] But tonight's world-renowned performers were just wonderful to sit there and listen to you and hear you and watch you.
Over the course of the past 99 years, Presidents have continued this great America tradition of lighting the National Christmas Tree through war and peace, struggle and progress. You know, for the evergreen treeit reminds us that even in the coldest, darkest days of winter that life and abundance will return.
It's a bright beacon of hope that reminds us of the promise we find in scripture of finding light in darkness, which is also a very American thing to do, perhaps the most American of things: to find light. And it's important to continue traditions like this one to remember that simple truth today.
For all those lost during the pandemic, we have also seen how much there is to gain: the appreciation and gratitude of the gift of time and the light of good will that we share as we look out for one another. Jill and I are especially grateful to our servicemembers and their families and for their sacrifices to our Nation.
We alsowe alsokeep in our hearts those who lost a loved ones because of this virus or any other cruel twist of fate or accident. We pray for them to find strength from sorrow, purpose from pain.
And as we look out across the country, with the promise of a new year ahead, we know this: We are a great nation because you, the American people. You are a good people. And because of you, we will never been more optimistic about the future. You've made me so optimistic I can'tI tell you what, we'rewe have so much ahead of us.
As we enter this holiday season, in my Catholic faith, I think there's a prayer attributed to St. Francis. It says: ""Where there is hatred, let there be tosow love; where there is discord, union; where there is doubt, faith; and where there is darkness, light."" And that's what we do. That's who we are. That's what the United States of America is all about.
So merry Christmas, America, may God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.

2021-12-02 00:00:00,"Remarks on the COVID-19 Response and National Vaccination Efforts and an Exchange With Reporters in Bethesda, Maryland","
The President. Please, if there's any audienceif there's any audience in the world I should be standing for, it's you, not you standing for me. But thank you very much. Good afternoon.
You know, in February, I came out here to the National Institutes of Health, and at NIH, and to our Vaccine Research Center to thank all of youthe world-class doctors, scientists, researchersfor the incredible work you've done during the pandemic and developing the vaccines, saving lives, giving us hope, alsoalsocontinuing to give me advice on developments as they occur.
I've seen more[laughter]of Dr. Fauci than my wife. We kid each other, but[laughter]they lookwho's President? Fauci. [Laughter] But all kidding aside, I sincerely mean it.
Today I'm back to announce our action plan to battle COVID-19 this winter, not that any of it is a surprise to any of you, because it's the combined advice from all of you that we developed this plan. And it doesn't include shutdowns or lockdowns, but widespread vaccinations and boosters and testing and a lot more.
There are five key actions that I want to see us take this winter. First of allfirst is expanding the nationwide booster campaign with more outreach, more appointments, more hours, more times and sites to walk in, providing boosters shots for up to 110 [100]* million Americans who are eligible for boosters.
And I want to note, parenthetically, I was talking to one of my folks who does polling and national strategy. And he said there is some evidence in one pollI won't mention it because I'm not positive of the number; I was told this as I was leaving the White Housethat there is an expectation that 30 percent of the nonvaxers that are ""no circumstances would I get a vaccination""because of the new variantare now saying, ""I'm going to get a vaccination."" So we hope that's true. I hope that's true.
But the second point is thatlaunching new family vaccination clinics to make it easier for children, parents, and whole families to get vaccinated in one place, and new policies to keep our children in school instead of quarantining them at home. I'll talk about the detail of each of these in a moment.
The third piece of this is making free at-home tests more available than ever before and having them covered by your private insurance plans, available in thousands of locations, and available at community health centers and other sites for the uninsured who don't have insurance.
Four, increasing our Surge Response Teams that ourour doctors, our nursesI know the people in this audience know incredibly well about what a surge team is, but medical staff into communities with rising cases and overburdened hospitals and short on personnel.
And by the way, they make a gigantic difference. The GovernorsRepublican Governors as well as Democratic Governors contact me when I go into their States, talk about ""thank you for these surge teams"" because it really makes a difference in somesome communities are hit so much harder than others. They justyou know, they just can't make it without what we're going toI'll speak to this in more detail in a second.
The fifth thing we're doing, we're going to accelerate our efforts to vaccinate the rest of the world and strengtheningstrengthen the international travel rules for people coming to the United States.
I plan to announcemy plan that I'm announcing today pulls no punches in the fight against COVID-19. And it's a plan that I think should unite us. I know COVID-19 has been very divisive in this country. It's become a political issue, which is a sad, sad commentary. It shouldn't be, but it has been. Now as we move into the winter and face the challenge of this new variant, this is a moment we can put this divisiveness behind us, I hope.
This is a moment we can do what we haven't been able to do enough of through this whole pandemic: get the Nation to come together, unite the Nation in a common purpose to fight this virus, to protect one another, to protect our economic recovery, and to think of it in terms of literally a patriotic responsibility rather than asomehow, you're denying people their basic rights.
Ithe plan I'm announcing today is a plan our scientists and COVID teams have recommended. And while my existing Federal vaccination requirements are being reviewed by the courts, this plan does not expand or add to those mandates, a plan that all Americans, hopefully, can rally around. And it should beand should get bipartisan support, in my humble opinion. And it should unite us, not continue to separate us.
Parenthetically, you all know that there are literallyas it relates to whether or not we're going to pay the Federal debt, whether we're going to in fact have a continuing resolution, et ceterasome of my friends on the other team are arguing that if I don't commit that there will never be any more mandates, they're going to let us default. In the neighborhood I come from in Claymont, they'd look at me and say, ""Go figure."" Go figure.
But before I explain each new action in more detail, I want toand I'm not going to embarrass you, Docbut I want to thank Francis Collins. You know, you've done an incredible job, Doc, here at NIHone of the most important scientists of our time, in my view. No, I'm not being solicitous. I think I'm not exaggerating a bit.
After I was elected President, Dr. Collins was one of the first callsI think you were the second call I madeto ask you if you'd stay onthe second call I made. It's because when I was Vice President I got to know Dr. Collins really well when I was given the opportunity to manage the Cancer Moonshot initiative.
And Dr. Collins is an incredible resource for our Nation. And I'm gratefuland I mean this sincerelyI'm grateful for everything he's done in this pandemicfor this pandemic and advancing all kinds of medical breakthroughs, including mapping the human genome.
He recently announced he is going to step down as Director of NIH this month after a truly consequential tenure. But the good news really is, Dr. Collins is going to return to the labthe National Human[laughter]Genome Research Institute. And we look forward to his unmatched ability to unlock possibilities that are within our reach.
And, Doc, the bad news for you is, you ain't getting rid of me, man. I'm going to keep calling you all the time because there's a lot of other things we can doyou can do and help me to get done. You just tell mepoint me in the direction, and I'll follow.
I just received a briefing from Dr. Collins and Fauci and Dr. Lawrence Tabak, as well as Dr. Julie Ledgerwood, and I appreciate it very much. My only regret was, it was a short meeting so I wasbecause I wascome and speak. I think we would all benefit more if had made my speech short and spent more time with these docs.
But you know, as theythey study the Omicron variant justthat we have just two cases reported here in the United States. But, as I explained on Monday, this new variant is cause for concern, but not panic. We know there'd be caseswe knew there'd be cases of thisof Omicron here in the United States, and it's here. But we have the best tools: the best vaccines in the world and the best medicine and the best scientists in the world.
We're going to fight this variance with science and speed, not chaos and confusion, just like we beat back COVID-19 in the spring and more powerful variantDelta variantin the summer and fall.
As a result, we enter this winter from a position of strength compared to where America was last winter. Last Christmas, fewer than 1 percent of American adults were fully vaccinated. This Christmas, that number will be seventy-seven72 percent, including more than 86 percent of seniors, the most vulnerable population. Last Christmas, our children were at risk without a COVID-19 vaccine. This Christmas, we have safe, effective vaccines for children age 5 and older, with 20 million children and counting now vaccinated. Last year, a majority of our schools were closed Christmastime in that area. Now over 99 percent of our schools are open.
But I've pledged to always be straight and give it to you straight from the shoulder as President of the United States and tell the American people exactly where we are. So here it is: Experts say that COVID-19 cases will continue to rise in the weeks ahead in this winter, so we need to be ready. You can read the whole plan we're talking about here at whitehouse.gov. Go to whitehouse.gov, and it's all laid out in detail.
For now, here are the five key points I want to expand on slightly. We're expanding our national booster campaign to provide booster shots to all eligible adults. Our docs and scientists believe that people who get a booster shot are more protected than ever from COVID-19.
I was just told, whicha question I got to askI've been meaning to ask for a long timewhether or notnot just it increases the resistance to the variant that is being dealt with, but it also isit is stronger. It not only just raises the total, but it's a strongermakes things more powerful, in terms of resisting.
And the Centers for Disease Control and Preventionthe CDC; the Food and Drug Administrationthe FDA; and our top public [health]* officials recommend all adultsall adultsget a booster shot when it's time.
But here's the deal: More than about 100 million are eligible for boosters, but haven't gotten the booster shot yet. Folks, if you're over the age of 18 and you got vaccinated before June the 2nd, 6 months has gone by. Go get your booster now. Go get it now.
Booster shots continue to be free. We've already made available 80,000 locations coast-to-coast in the United States of America80,000 locations to get the booster. And if you want to know exactly where to go, text your ZIP Code to 438829 to find where you can get your booster shot nownow.
And starting today, we're making it easier than ever to get a booster shot. I'm calling on pharmaciesand they've been cooperativebig and small to offer more appointments, more walk-in hoursincluding on weeknights and weekendsso you can get vaccinated at a time that works best for you and your family.
Pharmacies will send millions of texts and e-mails to remind their customers to return for their booster shots because they know who got they got the booster at CVC [CVS]*you've got tothey're nowthey've agreed they're going to send texts to that particular person when their time is up, when they've met theif it's Pfizer or Moderna, 6 months; if it's J&J, 2 months.
And toyou know, to reach out seniors, we're also collaborating with the American Association of Retired Persons, AARP, who will be reaching out to their 38 million members. They're going to make an aggressive effort. They're going to be hosting virtual townhalls to answer questions and even arrange rides for seniors to get their booster shots. And so that will all be coming.
My administration also contacted the 64 [63]*will contact the 64 [63]* million people on Medicare to remind them to get their booster shots. We have the ability to do that from the Federal level.
And just like I did to make it easier for folks to get their first and second shots, I'm providing paid off-time for Federal employee who goes to get their booster if they'rethe only time they get can itthe boosterwhere they are, if it's at such and such a day in the middle of the day, they can go. All they have to do is demonstrate that's where they wentor they took their son, daughter, husband, wife, mom, dadthey get paid. They don't get docked their pay.
And I'm asking other employers in the private sector to do the same thing. No one should have to choose between a paycheck and getting an additional protection for a booster shot.
Now, I want to reiterate: Dr. Fauci and Dr. Collins believe if you're worried about the Omicron variant, the best thing to do is to get fully vaccinated and then get your booster shot when you'rewhen you're eligible.
[At this point, the President coughed.]
Excuse me. We don't yet believe
[The President coughed.]
Excuse methat additional measures will be needed. But so that we are prepared if needed, my team is already working with officials at Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson and Johnson to develop contingency plans for other vaccines or boosters. And I'll also direct the FDA and the CDC to use the fastest process available without cutting corners onfor safety to get such vaccines renewedreviewed and renewedreviewed and approved if they're needed.
Second, we're expanding our efforts to vaccinate children ages 5 and up. For any parent worried about Omicron variant or the Delta variant, get your child vaccinated at one of 35,000 locations in the country, including doctors' offices, pharmacies, children's hospitals, and 9,000 pop-up clinics at schools. If you're wondering where to go, again, visit vaccines.com [vaccines.gov].*
And today I'm announcing that we're going to launch hundreds of new family vaccination clinics across the country. These sites are going to offer vaccinations for the whole familyone stop. One stop. Children can get vaccinated. Parents can get vaccinated, get their secondfirst or second shots or their booster shots.
Family vaccination clinics will be held in community health centers and other trusted locations. Some will be mobile to reach further into hard-to-reach communities. If it's booster shots for adults, vaccinations for kidsall at the same place at the same time.
Now, you know, when we first announced, I said the logistical problemit wasn't just that we didn't have enough vaccines when we got into office. But once we got the vaccine, the logistical effort to get all communities and all areas vaccinated was a gigantic logistical undertaking that would make any military proud of being able to do it. But because of the incredible talent, including our military, we got that done. And we can do the same thing now as we continue to expand.
We know parents of children under the age of 5 are wondering when the vaccine will be available for their little ones. That's the question I most get often asked now at functions.
We had a function celebrating Hanukkah and theChristmas and various things at the White House. The parents coming up to me, they're saying, ""I have a 3-year-old. Is there going to be a time that that canam I going to be okay? Is she going to be okayor he going to be okay?""
And let me say this: I strongly support the independent scientific review of vaccine usage for children under 5. We can't take shortcuts with that scientific work. But I'll do everything in my power to support the FDA to do this safely and quickly as possible when we get to thataround to that point.
Vaccinating our children is also critical to keeping our schools open. But while over 99 percent of our schools are open now, we need to make sure we keep that throughout the winterthis winter.
The CDC is now reviewing pioneering approaches likeit's going to be called ""test to stay""""test to stay"" policies, which could allow students to stay in the classroom and be tested frequently when a positive case in that classroom popped up that wasn't them. Up to now, you getgo home and you quarantine. But rather than being sent home and quarantining, they'd be able to stay, because a test would be available and regularly.
The CDC will be releasing the latest science and other findings in the coming weeks so that other schools can learn from anfrom the impedimentexcuse meif there's any impediments in this practice, they can learn to implement exactly what the best way to do this is. This is a process.
We want our children in school, and we are going to take new steps to make sure they stayit stays that way. But again, the best step is to vaccinate your children. Get them vaccinated.
The third, this winter we are going to make free at-home tests more available to Americans than ever before. To better detect and control the Delta variant, I made testing more available, affordable, and convenient. I used the Defense Production Act to increase production of rapid tests, including at-home tests.
When I came into office, none of these tests were on the market. Thanks to our actions and the work of all of you, we now have at least eight at-home testing options, and prices for those tests are coming down. But it still isn't good enough, in my view.
That's why I am announcing that health insurers must cover the cost of at-home testing. So that if you're one of the 150 million Americans with private health insurance, next month your plan will cover at-home tests.
Private insurers already cover the expensive PCR test andthat you get at a doctor's office. And now they will cover at-home tests as well. Now, for those not covered by private insurance, we're going to make available free tests at thousands of convenient locationslocations for folks to pick them up and take a test kit home.
The bottom line: This winter, you'll be able to test for free in the comfort of your home and have some peace of mind. This is on top of the 20,000 sites already around the country, like pharmacies, where you can go in and get tested for free. We have to keep this going.
Fourth, we're going to continue to help communities that experience rising cases this winter and improve the carethe care for those who get COVID-19. Since this summer, we have worked with Republican and Democratic Governorsas many Republican Governors as Democratic Governorsto deploy what we call Surge Response Teams.
These teams work. They provide needed staff for staff overruns atbadly needed staff where overrun hospitals are handling more patients than they can handle for their emergency rooms and intensive care units who don't have the personnel available. They help provide lifesaving treatments in communities in need, like monoclonal antibody treatments.
We have over 20 teams deployed now. Today I'm announcing that we're going to triple thatmore than double. We're going to get to 60 teams ready to deploy in States that experience a surge in cases over the course of this winter. I was just with the Governor in Minnesota, who is raving about the positive impact it's had on his State. But there's other States the samein the same circumstance.
Additionally, were increasing the availability of new medicines recommended by real doctors, not conspiracy theorists. Okay? For example, monoclonal antibody treatments have been shown to reduce the risk of hospitalization by up to 70 percent andfor unvaccinated people at risk of developing severe disease. We've already distributed over 3 million courses of these treatments to save lives and reduce the strain on hospitals.
And we havewe'rewe have promising new arrival pillexcuse me, antiviral pills on the horizon that could help prevent hospitalizations and death of people infected by COVID-19. We've secured enough supply of these pills already. And early indications are that these treatments will remain effective in the face of Omicron. We don't know that for sure yet, but that's the hope and expectation.
And like with the distribution of the vaccines, we will ensure that these medicines will be available to the hardest hit communities in America as well.
Fifth and finally, as we've seen with COVID-19 and the Delta variant and now with the Omicron variant, all that emerged elsewhere; it all came from somewhere else. And ultimately, beat this pandemicweto beat this pandemic, we need to go to where it came from and the rest of the world.
We also need to vaccinate the rest of the world. America has, in my viewcontinues to lead in that effort. We have shipped, for free, more vaccines around the world than all other countries in the world combinedevery other country combined. Over 280 million vaccines far to 110 countries, including to South Africa, where we've delivered all the doses they requested.
Now, today I am announcing that we'll accelerate the delivery of more vaccines to countries that need it, pledging to deliver 200 million dosesmore doses within the next 100 days, on our way to delivering more than 1,200,000,000 doses for the rest of the world.
Let me be clear: Not a single vaccine dose America ever sends to the rest of the world will ever come at the expense of any American. I'll always make sure that our people are protected first. But vaccinating the world is not just a moral toola moral obligation that we have, in my viewit's how we protect Americans, as we're seeing with this new variant.
America is doing our part, and we'll do more. But this is a global pandemic, and everyone needs to fight it together. And that includes countries we're helping that aren't particularly friendly toward us. Their populations are in trouble.
To their credit, the scientific community, particularly in South Africa, quickly notified the world of the emergence of this new variant. This kind of transparency is to be encouraged and applauded because it increases our ability to respond quickly to any new threats. And that's what we did.
On the very day the World Health Organization identified the new variant, I took an immediate step to restrict travel from the countries in Southin Southern Africa. But while we know that travel restrictions can slow the spread of Omicron, they cannot prevent it. But it does give us a little more time to take more precautions at home to prepare.
A month ago, we announced requirements that foreign travelers must be vaccinated if entering the United States. This week, I announced an additional action to strengthen international travel rules to give us more time to stop the spread and study a new variant.
It used to be that an international travel flying to the United Statestraveler flying to the United States had to test negatively 3 days before their departure from the otherthat country. Well, I'm announcing today that all inbound international travelers must test within 1 day of departure, regardless of their vaccination status or nationality.
This tighter testing timeline provides an added degree of protection as scientists continue to study the Omicron variant. And we are extending the requirement, both internationally and domestically, to wear masks for travel on aircraft, trains, and public transportation through the winter months.
I'll close with this. Again, the actions I'm announcing are ones that all Americans can rally behind and should unite us in the fight against COVID-19. And they come from a position of strength. We are better positioned than we were a year ago to fight COVID-19.
Since day one of my administration, we've been doing everything we can to beat this virus. And that's what we have to keep doing. That's how we keep our country and our businesses and our schools open.
And that's how, even with a pandemic, we've generated record job creation: 5.6 million new jobs since January 20, more than any President in American history. We're on the track to the fastest economic growth in four decadesin four decades.
We have moved forward in the face of COVID-19 and the Delta variant. And we'll move forward in the face of Omicron variant as well. And we'll do it by keeping the faith and doing it together as the United States of America.
Let me close again by saying God bless our doctors, our scientists, and all of you here at the NIH for what you're doing for the country and, quite frankly, for the world. You're the best. You're the very, very best. May God bless you all, and thank you for your patience in listening to me. Thank you.
Potential Lapse in Government Appropriations 
Q. Will there be a shutdown on Friday, sir? Will these Government employees receive their paychecks? Will there be a Government shutdown on Friday, sir?
The President. [Inaudible]
Q. Will there be a Government shutdown on Friday, sir?
The President. No.
Q. How will you see to it?
The President. How could you ask such a silly question? You see, Ilook, I don't believe that will happen. We have everything in place to be able to make sure there is not a shutdown unless some individual, notI spoke with Mitch McConnell, I spoke with Schumer. There is a plan in place, unless somebody decides to be totally erratic. And I don't think that will happen, so I don't think there will be a shutdown.
Thank you.

2021-12-01 00:00:00,Remarks on Lighting the Hanukkah Menorah,"
The President. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Please. Thank you. Please. Thank you. My name is Joe Biden. I am Jill's husband[laughter]as I'm known here in Washington and many other places.
Ihappy Hanukkah, everyone.
Audience members. Happy Hanukkah.
The President. You know, first, I want to thank Doug and Kamala. And this is a White House traditiona White House traditionbut the first time in history, it is a family tradition.
Doug, we're honored that you're leading the Menorah lighting. And I see my dear friends infrom Congress and the community out there, many of whom I've known for a long, long time. And I know how many more are joining us virtually.
You know, first of all, I want to welcome our Cabinet members: Attorney General Merrick Garland. Stand up so they can see you, Merrick. He is practicing the Jewish tradition of restoring justice to the Justice Department. [Laughter] And Secretary of Homeland Security, Ali Mayorkas, who has maybe one of the toughest jobs in Government, one with the widest breadth. And I want to thank you, Ali, for all you do. Thank you. And one of the brightest scientists and docs I know: the head of OSTP, Director Eric Lander. Eric.
And I want to welcome Israel's newest Ambassador to the United States, Michael Herzog. Michael. Just please stand up. Come on, stand up. Ambassador, I look forward to working with you to reaffirm the longstanding ties between the United States and the State of Israel.
I was saying to a couple of younger members of my staff, before I came over, about the many times I've been to Israel. I saidand then, all of a sudden, I realized, ""God, you're getting old, Biden."" [Laughter] I have known everyevery Prime Minister well since Golda Meir, including Golda Meir. And during the Six-Day War, I had an opportunity toshe invited me to come over because I was going to be the liaison between she and the Egyptians about the Suez, and so on and so forth.
And I sat in front of her desk, Chuck. And she had a guyher staff memberto my right. His name was Rabin. [Laughter] And she kept flipping those maps up and down. She had that bevy of mapssort of kept itand it wasit was so depressing what she wasabout what happened. She gave me every detail.
And all of a sudden, she looked at me, and she said, ""Mr. Ambassador, would you like a photograph?"" And I thought, ""Okay."" We got up. We walked out. And the three of us are standing in that rectangular area outside the office.
And wethe photographer, she was taking pictures and the press. And, Chuck, without turning her head, she looked straight ahead, but talking to me, she said, ""Why""she said, ""Why do you look so sad?"" And I saidand I almost turned. And I said, ""Well, Madam Prime Minister,"" I said, ""you've painted such a dismal picture.""
She said, ""Oh, no, no, no."" She said, ""Don't worry. We have a secret weapon in our battle in this area."" And I almost turned again. I said, ""What's that?"" She said, ""We have no place else to go.""
Ladies and gentlemen, you know, as Doug leads our candle lighting, he'll be joined by Leader Schumer, a good friend of mine. Chuck, we're so sorry about your dad. Abe waspassed away. And, Chuck, you said in the eulogy to your dadif you don't mind my saying thisyou said he never quit, he never cut corners, he led by example, he knew we had responsibility to others beyond ourselves, and he lived with the conviction that doing the right thing, even when it doesn'twhen others don't, will lead to success.
Chuck, you described you. You described you, pal. And Iyou could use the same words to describe you. And you know, in Abe's blessed memory, I hope you continue to lead us. Thank you. Thank you.
We also have a dear friend of mine for more than three decades, someone many of you know as a devoted leadercommunity leader: Susie Stern. Susie, thank you for all you've done.
And she's joined by Aaron Glatt, an infectious disease doctor and a rabbi. And Rabbi Dr. Glatt has been a champion of encouraging his congregants in his community to get vaccinated.
And I also love Rabbi Dr. Glatt's description of Hanukkah. He said, and I quote, ""A Jewish holiday ofis Hanukkaha Jewishthe Jewish holiday of Hanukkah is Thanksgiving on steroids."" [Laughter] Thanksgiving on steroids. Well, that's pretty good from Rabbi Dr. Glatt. And theological and medical opinion merged into one. [Laughter]
Look, more seriously, Rabbi has described America as a ""great nation of kindness."" And that's what we must always be: a great nation of kindness. That's not hyperbole; that's a fact.
You know, we're the most unique nation in the world. We're the only nation that's not based on ethnicity or religion or race. It'swe're based on an idea. An idea. ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men""and women""are created equal . . . endowed by their""it's an idea.
And so that's whyand our basis of our strength is not the example of our power, but the power of our example. In each successive generation, the Hanukkah story provides a powerful lesson and nourishes the wellspring of hope. In darkness, there's light. In cynicism, there's hope and optimism and an unyielding belief that miracles are possible.
When I was recentlyas Chuck knows, when I was recently withtalking with Xi Jinpinghe reminded me. He said, ""I know, I know, I knowas you said when I asked you to define America, you said I can do it in one word: possibilities."" Possibilities. That's who we are: a nation of possibilities.
And one such miracle brings us to a menorah we're lighting tonight. The artist who designed it is Manfred Ansonwas 1 of 20 boys selected by the Jewish Welfare Society to flee Germany from Austria [to Australia]* in the beginning of World War II.
A miracle, but one shadowed by darkness as his younger brother didn't make it outkilled in the concentration camp. Pain. The painit is easyin the pain, it's easy to lose hope and harden what's left of a broken heart and a broken soul. But not Anson. He joined the Australian Army and fought against the fascists.
After the war, his sister, who survived in concentration camps, wrote a letter addressed simply to ""Manfred Anson, Australia."" That was all it said. And it was a miracle: The letter found him. It found him. They reunited. Their parents had survived the war, but had not lived long enough to see their surviving son.
Manfred and his sister came to the United States and, in gratitude, optedit was his adopted homeland. He began collecting thousands of souvenirs of little Statues of Liberty, of the U.S. Capitol, and the Liberty Bell, which is what he used to design this menorah, this menorah we're going to pay tribute to. Two centuries of the two cultures.
This menorah is on loan from the National Museum of American Jewish History in Philadelphia, just across from the Liberty Bell itself. And one of the honors of my career was helping dedicate the museum in 2010, where I had a tough job following Jerry Seinfeld and Bette Midler, they were the other two speakers. [Laughter] Thank God, they didn't ask me to sing. [Laughter]
But I was honored to join my dear friend and museum founder, Ron Rubinwho passed away this yearafter dedicating that essential institution.
Anson passed away in 2012, and this is the second of his menorahs to be in the White House. As we honor his work, we also honor the abiding lesson of his life: that we must be grateful for our freedoms and we must defend those freedoms.
Thatas my dear friend and colleague who worked for me, for a long timemy staffbefore he became a prominent figure in the Congress himself, Tom Lantos, often reminded us, in words borne out of personal experience escaping from Hungary, and thatover 2,000 years of wisdom. This is what he saidhe said: ""The veneer of civilization is paper thin. We are its guardians, and we can never rest.""
Well, it's paper thin. And we are its guardians. All it takes is an opening, a sliver, a crack, the briefest nod of acceptance or legitimacy for ancient evils that have long plagued our society to come rushing in. And you all know it.
We just saw an incident so horribly anti-Semitic, flyers being left at people's homes in Los Angeles. We have to stand against the resurgence of this tide of anti-Semitism and other forms of intolerance and hate here at home and around the world. In that effort, there is nobody more qualified than Professor Deborah Lipstadt toour Special Envoy To Monitor and Combat Antisemitism.
You know, when we light this menorah in the White House, when Jewish families place menorahs in their windows, we're proclaiming liberty. We're exercising the freedom that the Maccabees sought to simply practice their faith. And we're showing that there's still light, that even the most fragile flame can be sustained in a tradition and nourish the soul of a people.
That little bit of lightthat little bit of lightwherever it is found, can dispel the darkness and illuminate a path forward. And whether it's in the Temple of Jerusalem or a temple of our democracy, nothing broken or profaned is beyond repair. Nothing. We can always build back better or perhaps build back brighter.
So thank you all for being here as we proclaim the light and liberty that this is all about.
And now I want to turn us over to another special guest, Rabbi Lauren HoltzblattHoltzblattexcuse meyou can call me ""Bidden""[laughter]I apologize, Laurenwho reminded all of us so powerfully after her eulogy for Ruth Bader Ginsburg that despairdespair is never, ever an option. Never.
Rabbi, please come forward.

2021-12-01 00:00:00,Remarks on World AIDS Day,"
The President. Thank you. Please, sit down. Mom, come on up here a minute. Come on. [Laughter]
[At this point, Marguerite Wheeler-Lara, mother of TruEvolution Founder and Chief Executive Officer Gabriel Maldonado, joined the President at the podium. Mr. Maldonado had introduced the President.]
I want you to meet Gabe's mom, who I still believe is more like his sister[laughter]than his mom. She is the inspiration. She is the reason why this young man has done such incredible things. And it's a simple lesson. My mother always told me: Listen to your mom. [Laughter]
Ms. Wheeler-Lara. Yes.
The President. Thank you. Thank you. You deserve a great deal of praise. Thank you.
Ms. Wheeler-Lara. Thank you so much. Thank you.
The President. Thank you.
[Ms. Wheeler-Lara returned to her seat.]
And one other thing before I begin my formal remarks. I look out in the audience and I see so many people who've been in this battle for so long. But the one person who I know from personal experiencehaving been here for more than 40 yearswho has been a champion when it was viewed as political suicide to be a champion was the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi. Nancy, stand up. Stand up. [Applause]
There was many others behind her as well. But, Nancynot a jokeyou were the one who started that fight in a way that you took it on with such passion. And it wasn'tit was notit was viewed as a political death sentence to take this issue on at the time. But you did it. You fundamentally changed the way we looked at this. You even got George Bush to lead on this too. [Laughter]
No, but all kidding aside, youI just want to personally, in front of all these people and all the world, thank you for your incredible work.
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm also joined by the Second Gentleman. He is a hell of a lawyer. [Laughter] And I thank him for being here. And, Mr. Secretary, thank you for your leadership of HHS.
Iand I want to thank Gabe for sharing his story, becauseyou know, you committed your life to this work, Gabe. I don't know whether you had that plan when you began it, but it's amazing what you've done. It's amazing what one person can do. It's an honor to meet with you both and to learn more about the work you're doing together to support your community.
Folks, we're also joined today by many who have been part of this effort for decades, including Dr. Fauci, who isIhe's all things to[applause]. Doc, you're the best. And you never walk away from an issue or a problem. Thank you.
And to all of you who have contributed so much to this mission of advocating for better prevention services for those at risk of getting HIV and improved care services; and living with HIV, breaking down the stigma, and fromand the disinformation that still exists around HIV/AIDS, I want to thank you. Thank you for your voices and for putting your hearts into your work. Because that's what you do. You put your hearts into the work, and people can tell.
It's because of all of you and the dedication of scientists and activists around the world that we've been able to dramatically reduce new HIV transmissions and make individuals with HIV today lead long and healthy lives.
And you know, it's because of the persistence and the resilience of the HIV community that we've changed so much about the way we approach health care, research, and equitable access to services, even the relationship between patients and health care providers. You know, and it's because of youand it's not hyperbole to suggest itthat we are within a striking distance of eliminating HIV transmission. Within striking distance.
And I think everybody but Nancy couldn't have imagined thisus being there 40 years ago. But the fact is that when CDC reported the first case thatwhat we now know as AIDS. It's something that we couldn't fully imagine even 20 years ago before the landmark investments that the United States made through PEPFAR andPresident's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.
But you made it possible. You made it possible. And I want to take this moment on this historic anniversary to acknowledge the incredible passion and the work that got us here. Because I know that so many of youfor so many of you, this is personal.
Today we once more raise a two-story-tall red ribbon on the North Portico of the White House to remember how far we've come, the work we have left to finish, and so we never forget the pricethe pricethat's paid all along the way.
And so many of you know and have relations with people who havewhether they're family members or friends that you've watched them, in the past, whither way. In the past four decades, as has been mentioned, an estimated 36 million people36 million peopleincluding more than 700,000 here in the United States, have died of AIDS-related illnesses. Think about that. That many people, more than almost all the modern wars combinedall the wars combined.
Here at home, we saw entire communities devastated by this disease, particularly among the LGBTQ+ individuals and members of racial and ethnic minority groups that Gabe has already spoken to. And a generation that endured the brunt of this epidemiclosing friends, loved ones, family members, partnersinstead of being seen and being recognized.
And I can recallif you excuse the point of personal privilegebeing, I think, in this very room when a Senator whohe's deceased now, so I don't want to mention his name because he can't defend himselfbut standing up and saying, along with another guy named Jerry Falwell, this is ""God's punishment."" I'm paraphrasing it. ""God's punishment. Finally.""
Think how much has changed. I mean, back in those days, the willingness of other Members of the Senate and the House to stand up and take him on wasNancy was there. Many of you were there. But it wasn't a universal thing. Wasn't a universal thing. But you all demandeddemanded to be treated with dignity and with equity. Those voices, those stories are invaluable.
As we recommit ourselves to finishing the fightthat we are going to make these individuals living with AIDS and are helping them drive and inform our efforts at every step of the way, because we're going to finish this fight.
And so, when my administration came to office, not onlynot only did we reestablish the White House Office of National AIDS Policy, whichit's hard to believe. [Applause] I don't deserve any credit. That was the easiest possible thing to do. [Laughter] No, I really mean it. Think about it. Think about it. That it gets a round of applause in the year 2021 when we say that. I mean, it should have never, everwell, I don't want to get into that. But anyway[laughter].
And I've asked Harold Phillips to lead our efforts. Harold[applause]stand up. Harold, I think they know you. [Laughter] Harold has dedicatedhe has decades of experience working withto end AIDS, the HIV epidemic. And I want to thank him for his leadership and willingness to join the administration, and releasing the National HIV/AIDS Strategy for 2022 to 2025. That's what he's doing.
It's a roadmap for how we're going to put our foot on the gas and accelerate our efforts to end the HIV epidemic in the United States by the year 2030. That's the goal. And it centers on the kind of innovative, community solutionscommunity-driven solutions that we know will work.
It's a plan to make sure that the latestthe latest advances in HIV prevention, diagnosis, and treatment are available to everyone, regardless of their age, race, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, or other factors. It shouldn't matter where you live in the country or how much money you make or how you respond or how wewe have to respond across the board to the HIV epidemic everywhere and support all people living with HIV.
And critically, this strategy takes on a racial and gender disparities in our health system that for much too long have affected HIV outcomes in our country to ensure that our national response is a truly equitable response.
So we're going to take aggressive action and back it up. We've asked Congress for $670 millionan historic budget requestfor the ""Ending the HIV Epidemic in the United States"" initiative. And I'm confident we're going to get that done. Right, team? [Applause]
We've got some great congressional champions for this work here today, starting with a woman who, as I saidI've already mentioned, as shea leader on the issue from the moment she set foot in Congress, starting with Nancy.
But also Representative Barbara Lee. Barbara Lee[applause]please. Maxine Waters. I learned a long time ago, when Maxine says, ""I have an idea,"" just say, ""Yes"". [Laughter] Just say, ""Yes."" And Sean Patrick Maloney. Sean. [Applause] JennifferDavid Cicilline. David. [Applause] And Jenniffer Gonzlez-Coln. [Applause]
Thanks for all you're doing. I reallyI was going to saynot for your supportthis is sui generis with all of you. You're just incredibly committed to this. And it's an issue that has a long history of bipartisan support, so I'm looking forward to working across the aisle, God willing.
I want make sure that everyone in the United States knows their HIV status, that everyone with HIV receives high-quality care and treatment that they deserve, and that we end the harmful stigma around HIV and AIDS. In particular, there is still a large number of States with HIVthat have HIV criminalization laws that do not reflect an accurate understanding of HIV.
For example, HIV cannot be transmitted through saliva. There are still laws on the books that criminalize spitting by people with HIV. I mean, this is 2021, the United States of America.
But we have to follow science, and that means eliminating the laws that perpetuate discrimination, exacerbate disparities, discourage HIV testing, and take us further away from our goal. We can do this.
And as we accelerate our efforts at home, we're not going to let up on the efforts to fight HIV/AIDS globally. Leading reauthorization of PEPFAR in 2008 was among the highlights of my time as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. And at the time[applause]and by the way, I was not one of the great leaders in this. I always supported the effort, but it wasn'tit was because I was chairman of the committee.
And believe it or not, there was a Republican Presidentand I'm not being a wiseguy when I say thiswho pushed for PEPFAR. There is an undeniable proof of the good that American leadership and innovation can achieve in the world when we commit to it. We have a moral obligation to do that and continue.
Since President Bush launched PEPFAR in 2003, we've saved more than 21 million lives. We've prevented millions of HIV infections. And we've helped at least 20 countries bring their HIV epidemics under control or reach their U.N. AIDS 90-90-90 treatment targets. That means 90 percent of the people living with HIV in a country will know their HIV status, 90 percent of HIV-positive individuals are able to access treatment, and 90 percent of those receiving treatment for HIV will have suppressed viral loads.
That's within our power. We're doing that. And though PEPFARthrough PEPFAR, the United States will support nearly 19 million men, women, and children with lifesaving HIV treatment. It's an incredible, incredible achievement.
Those are not the only lives saved though. They arethere are communities that are strengthened by the talents and contributions of HIV-positive individuals who are here today leading productive lives and leading the community because of what you've all done.
And as we have faced COVID-19 pandemic, we've also reaped additional benefits from our decades-long investment in strengthening health systems around the world through PEPFAR. Working through the CDC and USAID, PEPFAR supports more than 70,000 casecare facilities, 3,000 laboratories, and nearly 300,000 health care workers across 55 countries, all of which have been vital in supporting the global fight against COVID-19. By strengthening countries' abilities to fight AIDS, we've also improved our collective ability to fight other diseases.
And I want to thank and recognize a guy that I can't believe all he has done: Dr. JohnJohn Nkengasong. Nkengasong. I apologize, Doc. And, DocDoc Nkengasong, stand up. [Applause] And, DocDocDr. Nkengasong, you can call me ""Joe Bidden."" [Laughter]
But you're helping lead the important work of Omicron variant in this current role as Director of Africa's CDC and who is my nominee for Ambassador at Large to oversee PEPFAR and our global efforts to combat HIV.
I understand you're joined by Peter Sands. Peter, stand up, will you? The Executive Director of the Global Fund. This year marks 20 years of the Global Fund, and the United States is proud to be both a founding member of the Fund and the largest contributor. And the United States is looking forward to hosting the Global Fund's Seventh Replenishment Conference next year here. And so, thank you.
We still have a difficult road ahead of uswe can't kid ourselvesparticularly, addressing the disparities we see both domestically and globally, including the impact of high transmission rates among adolescent girls and young women. And today, as we look back on the past 40 years, where there has been so much pain and suffering, it's a testament to allall the hard work represented in this room and around the world that we are gathered today with hope in our hearts and for the future that's within our grasp.
We can do this. We can do this. We can eliminate HIV transmission. We can get the epidemic under control here in the United States and in countries around the world. We have the scientific understanding, we have the treatments, and we have the tools we need.
We're going to engage with people with livewith lived experience with HIV and ensure that our efforts are appropriate and effective and centered around the needs of the HIV community. Not us dictating; centered around the needs of the community.
And, folks, together, we're going to save lives. I can imagine no higher calling to which we could be dedicated than our commitment to save lives. And this is the one area where we can get a lot more done quickly.
So I want to thank you all again. I'm honored to be with you today. And this is one heck of a group of people who have hearts that are as big as their heads, and thank God[laughter]thank God, have in those beautiful skulls so much knowledge and capacity. [Laughter]
So thank you, thank you, thank you. Anyway, thanks.

2021-12-01 00:00:00,Remarks on the National Economy and Efforts To Address Global Supply Chain Bottlenecks and Rising Consumer Prices and an Exchange With Reporters,"
The President. Sorry to keep you waiting. Good afternoon.
It's wonderful to see the holiday decorations here in the White House. Tomorrow I'm going to light the National Christmas Tree to help kick off the holiday season.
Whatever you celebrate, we are looking ahead to a brighter and happier December with an economy markedly stronger than it was last year.
It's been a tough couple of years, but we've made incredible progress. And today I'd like to speak about some of the steps we're taking to address challenges in the economy and how those actions are already starting to pay off for American families.
Coronavirus Omicron Variant/Domestic Containment Efforts 
First, however, I want to quickly reiterate what I spoke about on Monday concerning Omicronthe variantand the steps we're taking to combat it. As I said, this new variant is a cause for concern, but not a cause for panic.
We have the best vaccines in the world, the best medicines, the best scientists. We're learning more every single day. And we'll fight this variant with science and speed, not chaos and confusion.
So let me repeat what the doctors and scientists have affirmed: The best protection against Omicron is getting a booster shot. Right now about 135 million Americans are eligible for a booster, but only about 40 million have gotten one thus far.
If you're over 18 years of age, you got vaccinated before Januaryexcuse me, June 1, go get your booster today. And if you're not vaccinated, now is the time to get vaccinated and take your children to get vaccinated. Every child over the age 5 can get a safe, effective vaccination.
Tomorrow I'll be putting forward the next steps that we'll be taking to fight COVID this winter, not with shutdowns or lockdowns, but with more widespread vaccinations, boosters, testing, and more.
National Economy and Efforts To Address Global Supply Chain Bottlenecks and Rising Consumer Prices 
Now, on to the economy. If you've watched the news recently, you might think the shelves in all our stores are empty across the country, that parents won't be able to get presents for their children on holidaysthis holiday season.
But here's the deal: For the vast majority of the country, that's not what's happening. Because of the actions the administration has taken, in partnership with business and labor, retailers and grocery stores, freight movers and railroads, those shelves are going to be stocked.
And many have heard that the CEO of Walmart, who I met with this week, speaking about the steps we've taken. He said, and I quote: ""The combination of private enterprise and Government working together has been really successful. . . . All the way through the supply chain, there's been a lot of innovation."" End of quote.
Here's what the progress has looked like. The first thing we had to do was speed up the operations at our ports. Americans are buying more goods than ever, and a lot of those goods come through our ports. Forty percent of the goods that come into the country on the West Coast come through two ports: Los Angeles and Long Beach.
To help relieve congestion, I brought together labor and management and asked them to step up and cooperate moreto move toward operating those ports not 5 days a week, 40 hours a week; but 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by adding more shifts at night and on the weekends.
Then we had to make sure people could transport those goods from the ports to stores and homes across the country. We've broken up logjams there as well. Private-sector port terminal operators at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, for example, have announced that they're going to eliminate fees when truck drivers come on the portcome into the port to pick up the containers if they do it at night or on weekends when roads are less congested.
Working with my administration, a major ocean carrierthe fourth largest in the worldannounced on Monday a new $100 discount when containers are picked up quickly, with larger discounts for nighttime and weekend pickups.
And we've announced this week that we are extending through February extra flexibility that allows truckers to drive more hours when they're transporting critical goods like gas, food, and medical supplies. Paired with thethese important safety measures, all of them are going to help move goods more quickly and get products that people want onto shelves all across the country.
Over the last month, the number of containers left sitting on docks blocking movement to those stores is overwas for over 8 days. Now it's downit's downby 40 percent, which means they're heading to shelves in stores more quickly. That's an incredible success story. The Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach have moved 16-percent more containers so far this year than last year.
By working with business and labor, my administration has been able to handle the huge surge in goods moving through some of our biggest ports. And that's translated into shelves across our country being well stocked.
You don't have to take my word for it. On Monday, I convened a group of CEOs from some of the largest retailers and grocery stores in the Nation, as well as companies who work with small businesses across America, including the CEO of Walmart, as I mentioned, along with Best Buy, CVS, Samsung, Mattel, Etsy, and QVC.
My administration has been working with many of the CEOs and others to keep goods moving through our supply chains to ensure the shelves are stocked heading into the holiday season. The CEOs I met with this week reported that their inventories are up, shelves are well-stocked, and they're ready to meet the consumer demand for the holidays.
The CEO of Etsy represents over 5 million small businesses and entrepreneurs. He told me, and I quote, ""Our survey data says there are lessthey are less concerned about supply chain challenges this year than they were last year."" End of quote.
I've also spoken with the CEOs of UPS and FedEx, which are on track to deliver more packages than ever. Now, I can't promise that every person will get every gift they want on time. Only Santa Claus can keep that promise. But there are items every year that sell out, that are hard to find.
Some of you moms and dads may remember Cabbage Patch Kids back in the eighties or Beanie Babies in the nineties, or other toys that have run out at Christmas time in past years when there was no supply chain problem.
But we're heading into a holiday season on very strong shape. And it's not because of luck. We averted potential crisis by figuring out what needed to get fixed, and then we brought people together to do the hard work of fixing it.
That's exactly what we're doing with the second concern I want to talk about today: prices. Here are a few things you should know: Just about every country in the world is grappling with higher prices right now as they recover from the pandemic. In the United Kingdom, price increases have hit a 10-year high. In Germany, a 28-year high. In Canada, price increases are the highest they've been since the nineties. This is a worldwide challengea natural byproduct of a world economy shut down by the pandemic as it comes back to life.
Prices are still out of sunkexcuse me, prices are still out of sync as the world comes back. But as we continue to overcome these obstacles, the more price pressures will ease. But I have not been content to sit back and wait. I've used every tool available to address the price increases. And it's working.
Take gas prices: Last week, I announced the largest ever release from the United States Strategic Petroleum Reserve to increase the supply of oil and help bring down prices.
I brought together other nations to continue and contribute to the solution. India, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the United Kingdom all joined us. They all agreed to release additional oil from their reserves. And China may be doing so as well. This worldwide effort we're leading will not solve the problem of high gas prices overnight, but it has been making a difference.
Over the last month, likely due in part to anticipation of this action, we've seen the price of oil and gasoline on the wholesale markets come down significantly. In fact, since the end of October, the average weekly price of gasoline in the wholesale market has fallen by about 10 percent. That's a drop of 25 cents per gallon. Those savings should reach the American people very soon, and it can't happen fast enough.
And I've asked the Federal Trade Commission to consider whether potentially illegal and anticompetitive behavior in the oil and gas industry is causing higher prices to remainbe maintained for consumers when the overall cost of oil is down. We can also ensure that American people are paying a fair price for gas.
So let's take a step back and take stock of where our economy is. Wages are up. Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, we've delivered significant tax cuts for families raising kids. Tax cuts and rising wages for middle class families mean that Americans, on average, have about $100 more in their pockets every month andthan they did last yearabout $350 more each month than they did before the pandemic, even after accounting for inflation.
Let me repeat that: Even after accounting for rising prices, the typical American family has more money in their pockets than they did last year or the year before that. In fact, we're the only leading economy in the world where household income and the economy as a whole are stronger than they were before the pandemic.
You know, there are other signs of strength too. The number of small businesses is up 30 percent compared to before the pandemic.
Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, we've cut child poverty in America by more than 40 percent. Think about that: Millions of children who spent last Christmas in poverty will not bear that burden this holiday season. And the Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen, described it yesterday, that it is, quote, ""A profound economic and moral victory for our country."" End of quote.
Since I took office, we've had record job creation: 5.6 million new jobs since January 20 of this year. The unemployment rate has fallen to 4.6 percent. We're seeing more new small businesses, higher wages, and more disposable income; fewer children in poverty; fewer people getting unemployment checks.
None of this was inevitable. It was because of the American Rescue Plan, which virtually every Democrat in Congress voted for and every Republican voted against. It was because of the hard work my administration has done to try to solve the challenges in our economy, instead of just pointing fingers and complaining.
Nownowit's time to build on our success and cut costs further for families. That's what my Build Back Better plan does. It will lower out-of-pocket costs for childcare, eldercare, housing, college, health care, and prescription drugs. These are the biggest costs that most families face.
In fact, a new independent analysis released today showed that my Build Back Better plan would mean $7,400 in tax cuts and savings for the typical family with four kidsexcuse me, the typical family of four with two kids.
Seventeen Nobel laureate winners in theNobel economic winners have written a letter affirming that this bill will reduce inflationary pressure in the economy. Two of the leading rating agencies on Wall Street confirmed this month that my plan will not add to inflationary pressures. In fact, they will, quote, ""take the edge off of inflation.""
Now my Republican friends are talking a lot about prices, but they're lined up against my Build Back Better plan, which would go right at the problem for rising costs for families. Why is that? I don't want to speculate on anyone's motive. But it's always easier to complain about a problem than to try to fix it.
One Republican Senator even said that rising prices were, quote, ""a gold mine,"" end of quote, for Republicans politically. Imagine rooting for ahigher costs for American families just to score a few political points.
The fact is, the Build Back Better plan is fiscally responsible. And it's the first major piece of legislation in more than a decade that is not only fully paid for, but will generate more than $100 billion in deficit reduction.
It fully covers the cost of its investments by making the largest corporations and the richest Americans pay a little more in taxes. Think about that. Because that's a tradeoff worth making, in my view: having those who have done very well pay their fair share in order to provide a little breathing room for millions of American families.
But my critics don't seem to agree. They have a lot of speeches about high prices, supply chain, and other challenges we are facing, but they don't offer any answers. So they're just doing the ""no"" vote. That's their plan: Vote ""no.""
But what does that mean? What does a ""no"" vote mean on this bill? Not on cable news, not on Fox, notin the real world, in your life, around your kitchen table.
Well, here's what it's going to mean: It means for millions of American families, this billthe bills you're paying right now for daycare could be substantially lowered, capped at 7 percent of your income. But the Republicans said, ""No, pay more.""
It means the bills you're paying right now to take care of your elderly parent could have been lower, a lot lower. But Republicans said: ""No, don't vote for this bill. Pay more.""
It means the cost of your prescription drugs could have been lower, a lot lower. But Republicans think that those 200,000 children, for example, who need regular doses of insulin should continue to pay as much as $1,000 a month, instead of $35 a month.
Think of that. It not only affects the health of the child and the family, but imagine your being a parent and not being able to afford $1,000 a month. Not only it risks the health of your child, but it robs you of your dignity. The list goes on, but the point's the same.
What I have proposed is a way to lower some of the most difficult costs families have to pay every month by asking big corporations40 of the Fortune 500 companies paid zero in taxes; making $40 billion in the processand the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share in taxes.
Look, remember: We're in a situation that as far as Republicans are concerned, they'd rather the bills at your kitchen table be higher so the tax bills of corporate conference rooms and big mansions can be lower.
In this case, let me tell you something: Nothing will be more expensive for American families than a ""no"" vote on the Build Back Better plan. I believe we simply can't afford to do nothing and wait and see what happens. In the moments we face today, that's justisn't a responsible course.
We live in uncertain times. Families are anxious about COVID, the economy, the cost of living. And the way to relieve that anxiety is with consistent, determined, focused action. I started my Presidency with the American Rescue Plan. Now that law is carrying our Nation forward on vaccinations, boosters, keeping our schools open, and so much more. I designed it as a year-long plan because I knew we'd have a lot of obstacles to overcome.
Next, we passed the bipartisan infrastructure law because a lot of our infrastructure is crumbling. We have to prepare ourselves to compete and win the 21st-century global economy. For most of the 20th century, we led the world in significantby a significant margin because we invested in ourselvesnot only in our roads and highways and bridges, but in our people and in our families.
We built the Interstate Highway System. We invested to win the space race. We were among the first to provide access to free education, beginning back in the late 1800s. These decisions to invest in our country and our families were a major reason why we were able to lead the world for much of the last century.
But somewhere along the way, we stopped investing in ourselves. America is still the largest economy in the world. We still have the most productive workers and the most innovative minds in the world.
But we've risked losing our edge as a nation. Our infrastructure used to be the best in the world. Today, according to the World Economic Forum, we rank 13th.
And we have to invest in our greatest asset as well: our people. For example, we used to lead the world in educational achievement. Now, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ranks America 35 out of 37 major countries when it comes to investing in early childhood education and care. We can't be competitive in the 21st-century global economy if we continue to slide.
One of the reasons I believe so firmly in this is because I know what this country can be. We've always been a nation of possibilities. We didn't become this Nation we know by dreaming small. Throughout our history, we've emerged from crisis by investing in ourselves.
During and after the warthe Civil War, we built the transcontinental railroad, uniting America. During the cold war, we built the Interstate Highway andSystem, transforming the way Americans are able to live their lives. And now we'll build the economy for the 21st century.
I truly believe that 50 years from now, when historians look back on this moment they're going to say this was the beginning of the moment when America won the competition for the 21st century. I think that's what we're going to see happen, God willing.
May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you very much.
Q. Mr. President
Coronavirus Omicron Variant 
Q. Mr. President, what's your level of concern that the new variant will end up exacerbating the very issues on supply chains your team has been working on the last several months?
The President. Well, look, you know me; I'm an optimist. What we have seen so far does not guarantee that's the outcome. As a matter of fact, we're going to know in the next several weeks thatjustnot only how transmissible the disease is, but how extensive it is, how dangerous it is, and what damage it doesand most importantly whether, the vaccines we have are capable of dealing with this virus, particularly if the boosters we're trying to get everyone to get.
So I think the jury is still out. I think it's a little early to make that judgment. But am I concerned? Of course I am, until we get the final answers.
I'll take couple more questions. Yes.
Oral Arguments Before the U.S. Supreme Court on a Mississippi Abortion Law/Abortion Rights 
Q. Mr. President, what is your reactionthe Supreme Court heard the abortion case today and the Justices signaled that they're on the verge of major changes to abortion law in the United States. Do you have any plans to try to clarify the law? What is your reaction to that?
The President. Well, first of all, I haven'tI didn't see any of the debate todayor just the presentation today. And I support Roe v. Wade. I think it's a rational position to take, and I continue to support it.
Q. Mr. President, Mr. President
Global Supply Chain Bottlenecks/National Economy 
Q. Mr. President, thank you so much. There are a number of Presidents, from Jimmy Carter to Richard Nixon, who really tried to impact inflation and supply chains and weren't able to largely do that. How confident are you that you have the tools and the power to do something about supply chains that help Americans find some relief?
The President. Because what I've seen so far, based on what we've done. This is the first time I've seen where labor and business is so ready to cooperate, because they didn't go through a period of a yearover 2 years almostof the impacts of a terrible virus that has caused real damage to the world economy.
So I think people are in a different state of mind than they may have been during the Carter years, as well as the Nixon years. It's just a different world.
Q. And, Mr. President
Q. Mr. President, quick question on testing requirements?
Former President Donald J. Trump 
Q. Mr. President, Mark Meadows has written a book revealing that President Trump tested positive for COVID 3 days before your first debate. Do you think the former President put you at risk?
The President. I don't think about the former President. Thank you.
Q. Mr. President, whatever happened to your promise to ""shut down"" the virus?
Q. Were you aware that he tested positive?
Q. Sir, what testing requirements are you going to implement?

Build Back Better Act 
Q. On the timeline, sir, for Build Back Better, do you want it to pass in December or is it okay if it rolls into later months, sir?
The President. The sooner, the better. The sooner, the better.
Coronavirus Vaccination Efforts 
Q. Mr. President, are you considering any new vaccine requirement or efforts to try to get more Americans vaccinated? You said that is the key to protecting against Omicron. Is there anything you're going to do?
The President. I'll be talking about that on Thursday.
Q. Anything you can preview for us?

U.S. Travel Restrictions From South Africa and Elsewhere/Coronavirus Omicron Variant 
Q. Mr. President, how long will the travel restrictions on countries in Southern Africa be in place?
The President. Well, it kind of depends. Iit's going week to week here to determine what we need and what the state of affairs. We're going to learn a lot more in the next couple of weeks about the lethality of this virus, about how much it spreads, about whether what we have can control it, et cetera. So it will depend on those issues.
Q. And, Mr. President
The President's Approach With Partner Countries

The President. Whoa. [Laughter] Sarah, thank you for that introduction. I was saying to Sarah in the back, because Iwhen I was Sarah's age, the idea that I'd be standing, waiting to introduce a Presidentit didn't matter who it wasI would find it a little daunting. And I was trying to reassure her, but obviously she didn't need any reassurance whatsoever. [Laughter] Zero. And thank you for your service to the United States military. Really, thank you.
Governor, thanks for the welcome to Minnesota. I was telling the Governor on the wayon the ride here from the airport that I started coming to Minnesota back in 1973 because one of themy mentors, for realone ofit ended up being twowas Hubert Humphrey.
When Ihe helped me campaign in 1972 as a 29-year-old candidate for the United States Senate in my home State of Delaware, and he gave me credibility I'm not sure I deserve, but it helped a great deal. And after I got elected, there was abefore I wasI wasn't old enough to be sworn in. I had to wait to be eligible. You had to be 30 years old to be sworn in. Your constituents can elect you at any age, but you can't be sworn in until you're 30.
And while I was in Washington, making sure that I was hiring my staff, I got a phone call from my fire department saying there had been an accident. And the poor woman they put on the phone had to sayshe just blurted out, ""Your wife and daughter are dead, and your kids won't make it."" My wife was Christmas shopping and was broadsided by a tractor trailer.
My point about it is that one of the first persons to come to me were the Humphreysnot just the Senator. And then a guy, who became a great friend and mentor was Fritz Mondale, as well.
So I've been from the Iron Range all the way down to your southernsoutheastern border, and it's an incredible State, and you've elected some incredible people, including the people you heard from earlier today, which I'll speak to a little bit in a minute.
TheI see a lot of mayors are here. And you know, I told you that's the toughest job in America. They know where you live. [Laughter] But it really is. You affect people's lives more than anybody else directly, and you're right there. So thank you for what you do.
And from my administration, I also have the Secretary of Education, Miguel Cardona, who is with us today. We served in Congress for a long time, and I'm delightedI'm delightedfor him being here.
Shooting in Oxford, Michigan 
Before I get into my remarks in any detail, I was informedafter the tour, I learned about a school shooting in Michigan. We learnedwell, as we learn the full details, my heart goes out to the families enduring the unimaginable grief of losing a loved one. Apparently, there are somewhere in the order of nine people shot, and severalor three, I think, are dead.
And the young man, I thinkas I understand it from staffwas about 15 years old, and he turned himself in. And just said heand he claimed his right against self-incrimination and handed over his pistol. That's all that we know about it. But you've got to know that that whole community has to be just in a state of shock right now.
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act 
But look, one of the things that I want to mention is, I want to tell you about the infrastructure law I signed on Thanksgiving. And it would not be possibleand this is not hyperbolewithout the Minnesota congressional delegation.
Senator Amy Klobuchar is a leader on many issues. Her colleagues looked to her on everything from lowering the cost of prescription drugs to how to get broadband to the whole country. And Senator Klobuchar and I have been friends for a while. She knows how to work across the aisle and make progress. It's a big deal. [Applause] No, you really do. And not only do her colleagues call for advice, her President calls for advice. [Laughter] And you know that's true.
And Senator Tina Smith, she's also led on making sure that Minnesotans and all Americans get accessaccess to high-speed internet. Senator Smith is making sure that the infrastructure and Build Back Better investments are going to help fight both the causes and the effects of climate change.
Andand Representative Angie Craig, who I'm going to get to ride home withshe's going to get on Air Force One when we're going back. [Laughter] I'm going to spend a little time with her. She had a better means of transportation getting out of here. I don't know what it was, but[laughter].
But all kidding aside, Iwe've workedshe's worked on the infrastructure law. She constantly reminds us that it's places like Dakota County, and it's connecting people to jobs and opportunities. And that's why Angie has always been the champion of schools like DCTC and investments in roads and bridges and high-speed internet.
And Representative Dean Phillips. Dean, where are you? Deanfrom the very beginning, Dean has led getting bipartisan support to get this deal done. And you'd think this would be a slam dunk, but we did it without all but a few Republicans being able to come across and vote for it. But thank you for the work you did, Dean. I really mean it. And Betty McCollumBetty has been fighting for a strong infrastructure package for more than a little bit of time. There you are, Betty.
Andbut I also want to acknowledge a few other people who couldn't be here today. Your attorney general, Ellison, is such a fighter for justice. And Representative Omaris he here?
Audience member. [Inaudible]
The President. Oh, okay. I was going to say, I totally would havereminded us that we all need to invest in our people, in universal precare and affordable childcare.
Look, here's what this is all about
[At this point, there was feedback from the microphone.]
Rebuilding America, getting this done
[The feedback continued.]
No. Rebuilding America, investing in Americathat's what this is about. And we're doing it as we continue to battle the pandemic.
As I told the American people yesterday, this new variant is a cause of concern, but not a cause to panic. On Thursday, I'll put forward a detailed strategy outlining how we've gonewe're going to fight this COVID this winter, not with shutdowns and lockdowns, but with more widespread vaccinations, boosters, testing, and much more.
In the meantime[applause]. In the meantime, the best protection is getting fully vaccinatedgetting a booster shot. I urge all Americans who haven't yet to get that done. Get it done today. We're going to keep fighting through this with every tool we have, and we areyou know, as we did with the original virus and with the Delta virusor, variant.
And we're also going to keep our historic economic growth moving. One of the ways we're going to do that is with the bipartisan infrastructure law that we signed into law 2 weeks ago. Over the next several weeks, I'm going to be traveling all over the country, and so will Vice President Harris and my Cabinet and folks throughout thisour administration to show how these investments are going to change your lives, change lives for the better.
Because we know that we can't just build back to what it was before. That used to be the rule. If anything got wiped out by a weather event, you were able to build back that road at exactly the specifications it was before. But you can't now, because the climate is not going to get better. It'shopefully, we're not going to get worse.
But you're going to have to build that road a couple of feet higher. You can't build it back to what it was. You can't replace those high powerlines that come down with the same kind of construction. They have to be built so they're more resilient. So that's what I mean when I say ""build back better."" It's necessary.
And theyou know, schools like DCTC are going to help us do just that. In places like this, we're going to train the next generation of workers to do the jobs that my infrastructure law and our Build Back Better Act are going to put into even greater demand. We're going to need more qualified people.
And we're talking about students learning how to repair electric vehicles and battery drivetrains, which aremajor auto manufacturers saywill be 40 to 50 percent of all vehicles in the United States of America by the year 2030; becoming line workers we'll need to have to modernize our electrical grid and the commercial electricians who can help us install 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations we're going to put in, including along the highways we're building, so you never have to worry about running out of power.
You'll be able to travel from[applause]. Training as construction managers to oversee all phases of construction projects we're going to be seeing all across Minnesota, like the Twin Port Interchange andPorts Interchange in Duluth and the Link project in Rochester. These are the jobs of today and tomorrow. We're going to help America win the competition for the 21st century. We're getting back in the game.
And the better part of the 20th centuryfor the better part, we led the world by a significant margin because we invested in ourselves and our people. We invested in our infrastructurein our roads, our highways, our bridges, our ports, our airportsthe arteries of our Nation that allow commerce to function smoothly and move swiftly.
And we've investedwe invested in our people. We invested in opportunity in the past. But we're amongwe were among the first to provide access to free education in the late 1800s, early 1900s, which had us leap ahead of the rest of the worldthe first nation in the world with universal education. We invested to win the space race. We led the world in research and development that led to the creation of the internet. Andbut somewhere along the way, we stopped investing. And we're at risk of losing our edge as a nation to China and the rest of the world that's catching up and surpassing us in some areas.
Our infrastructure used to be rated the best in the worldnot hyperbole. It was rated the best in the world. But according to the World Economic Forum, we now rank 13th in the world in terms of the quality of our infrastructure.
And we're turning things around in a big way now. It starts with roads and bridges. In 2007, this State sounded the national alarm of our decaying infrastructure when the I-35 bridge collapsed, killing 13 people and injuring another 140. In the United States of America, a major bridge on a highway collapsed. This is America, for God's sake. And we know about our infrastructure problems; we've known for a long time. Now we're finally doing something about it. No more talking. Time for action. Time for action.
So, folks, this law makes significant investments in our roads and bridges inthe largest investment in nearly 70 yearsfixing so many of the 661 bridges and nearly 5,000 miles of highway here in Minnesotajust Minnesotathat are in poor condition.
Those decaying roads cost Minnesota drivers an extra $543 a year in gas, repairs, and longer commute timesevery family. That's 543 hidden dollars in hidden taxes for Minnesota families. And by the way, we might even be able to get something done fixing County Road 42 train crossing. [Laughter] We have one in Delawarewe have a train crossing what used to be the General Motors plant. I've counted as many 142 cars sitting there for about 10 hours waiting to cross. [Laughter] No way out.
Look, this law includes the most significant investment in passenger rail in the past 50 yearsand in public transportation everever. And here in Minnesota, it means replacing transit vehicles that are past their useful life, switching from diesel to electric, getting more people where they have to go safer, faster, and cleaner.
And it means more projects like the Orange Line, which is having its grand opening on Saturday, and is connecting communities along I-35 West with bus rapid transit, making it easier and faster to commute from Burnsville to Bloomberg toexcuse me, to Bloomington to Richville, to major job centers in downtown MinnesotaMinneapolis, Minnesota; to corporate headquarters like U.S. Bank and Best Buy and Target. It's going to change things.
This law invests $42 billion to modernize our ports and our airportsthe Port of Duluth is the largest port in the Great Lakes; or the Minneapolis-St. Paul airport, one of the busiest airports in the Midwestmaking it easier for companies to get goods to market, reducing supply chain bottlenecks, lowering costs for families, making sure that what you need gets to your ships, your trucks and trains, and eventually to your home on time.
Of course, that's not all this law achieves. The law will start to replace 100 percent of the Nation's lead pipes in the United States and American service lines. A recent survey estimated there are 260,000 or more lead pipelines just here in Minnesotajust Minnesota.
And we'll help communities like Coates build connections to water treatment facilities so every single child in Minnesota and across America can turn on the faucet and drink clean water without their parents worrying about how ""forever chemicals""you ever think you'd hear that phrase 20 years ago, ""forever chemicals""?are in the ground and how they're impacting on the health and well-being of the population.
Folks, this is the United States of America, for God's sake. This is long overdue. We're going to need tens of thousands of plumbers and pipefitters to do the work. And they'll get paid a prevailing wage with benefits and the ability to build a middle class life.
The law is going to make high-speed internet affordable and available everywhere in America, and create jobs laying down the broadband lines. Today, 12 percent of Minnesotans and households don't have internet subscriptions. And in some places, there's no broadband infrastructure at all. This law is going to make high-speed internet affordable and available everywhere in Minnesotaurban, suburban, and ruralwith over $20 billion.
In the 21st century in America, no parent ever should have to sit outside a fast food restaurant[laughter]to be able to hook up to the internet so their child can do their homework online. Think about that.
The law also builds up our resilience against extreme weather events, which Minnesota is no stranger to, like wildfires this summer in Superior National Forest that sent smoke into the Twin Cities; and tornadoes that touched down in Burnsville and Apple Valley in September; or the heavy rains that have closed roads and contaminated wells in this area in the past.
Nationallynationallylast year, extreme weather cost the United States Government $99 billionjust last year. I was out whenthose forest fires out in California and Nevada and that area, and it's astounding. More timber and homes and businesses have been burnt to the ground this past fire season than the entire square miles of the State of New Jersey, from New York City all the way down to Cape May. That's how much burned to the ground. Nothing there. I flew over it in helicopters. Nothing.
And you see reservoirs down 40, 50, 60 feet. Worrying about whether the Colorado River is going to continue to flow. This is just dire stuff, but all within our capacity to deal with.
This law builds back our bridges, our water systems, our powerlines, our electric grid better and stronger, more resilient and resistant to the negative impacts and effects of climate change so fewer Americans will be flooded out of their homes or lose power for days and weeks after a storm.
Down in LouisianaI have with mewho now works with me and handles a big chunk of what I have to do, former chairman of the Black Caucus in the Congress, Cedric Richmond.
Audience member. Yeah!
The President. Cedric had me down in Louisiana, in New Orleans. That stormthat hurricane that went throughhad high wind peak at 178 miles per hour. But you know what? When I went from there up to North Jersey and New York, more people died in Manhattanin Queens, Manhattan, because of 20 inches of rain falling and their basements flooding so they couldn't get out. More people died there than did in the hurricane in New Orleans.
Folks, there's so much more in the law. Most of all, this law does something truly historic. It's going to help rebuild the backbone in this Nation: working people and the middle class. When I ran for President I said I was running for three reasons. One, to restore the soul of the countryto have somerestore some decency in how we dealt with one another. And twoand twoto rebuild the backbone of the country: hard-working, middle class folks and working class folks who built the country.
Folks on Wall Street aren't bad, but they didn't build America. The people who workcoming out of this school are the ones who built America. They built America, and they've been left behind for much too long. And we're going to rebuild this economy from the bottom up and the middle out.
I've never known a time when the middle class has done well that the very wealthy haven't done very, very well. I'm not being solicitous. I'm being deadly earnest. But I'm tired of this trickle-down economy. I'm tired of it.
This is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America. And the only way this works is if the blue-collar Americans do the building. And that's the only way it's ever worked. And we are going to do it again. Mark my words. Mark my words. The same goes for my plan to build back better for our people. For example, the cost of a 2-year degree in Minnesota is nearly $6,000 a year. Over a third of the students at DCTC receive Pell grants. My Build Back Better plan is going to increase the maximum Pell grant award by another $550 to make it more affordable.
We're going to invest an unprecedented $10 billion in job training programs at a school likeschools like this one; and expand registered apprenticeships and preapprenticeship programs. Andand very importantlythis bill will deliver universal preschool to every 3- and 4-year-old in America.
Folks, one study found that the low-income children participating in a preschool program were 47-percent more likely to go on and earn an associate or a higher degree after going through 12 years of school, without problems.
We have to build the foundation for success. My wife Jill is a community college professor and has been for some time. She always points out: Any nation that outeducates us is going to outcompete us. It's a simple proposition.
Look what the rest of the world is doing. Look at what the rest of the world is doing. China is investing billions of dollars in early education. I can go down the list.
Look, this Build Back Better plan is also going to ensure that parents can afford childcare and that childcareand that childcare workers can actually get a raise anda raise they deserveand more education.
If you're paying $14,000 for childcare, like a lot of Minnesota families do, my Build Back Better plan is going to make a giant difference in your life because your childcare costs will not bewill be capped at 7 percent of your income7 percent. That's it. Seven percent of your income.
That's going to make a huge difference for the economy overall, but for millions of workers who had to drop out of the workforce not because they wanted to, but because they couldn't find available childcareespecially the 2 million women who left the workforce during this COVID crisis.
If you're one of the millions of Americans paying too much for insulin, my Build Back Better plan is going to change that as well, because we're going to lower prescription drug costs. And that means you won't pay more than $35 a month for your insulin. It's important not only from a health standpoint, but from a standpoint of personal dignity.
Imagine if you're a parent of one of the 200,000 children in this country with type 1 diabetes needing that insulin. Insulin can cost as much as $1,000 a month. If you can't afford it, it's not only a health risk, but it deprives a parent of their dignity. It deprives them of their dignity, of your ability to do one thing every parent wants and deserves to be able to do: to say to their childto look at them and say, ""Honey, it's going to be okay."" Imagine not being able to say that.
And by the way, we're not artificially reducing that cost. It costs $35 for the insulin when it was first invented and patented. They've done not a single thing since then to improve it; it's good. And now it costs $1,000 a month?
Folks, lowering the cost of childcare, eldercare, housing, health care, prescription drugs, and meeting the moment on climate change, that's what this plan does. Frankly, I'm surprised that not a single Republican in Congress has joined us in supporting it. It can't be because it would add to inflation. Seventeen Nobel laureatesseventeen3 weeks ago, spontaneously sent me a letter saying that it would have the opposite effect; it would actually reduce long-term inflationary pressures.
It can't be because it would add to the deficit, because it reduces the deficit over the long term. It can't be because it's fiscally responsible, because it's fully paid forfully paid for. No oneno oneearning less than $400,000 a year will pay a single penny more in Federal taxes.
Fifty-five percentand I come from the corporate State of America: Delaware. More corporations are incorporated in Delaware than every other nation and every otherexcuse meState in the Nation. And guess what? Fifty-five percent of the Fortune 500 companiesthe largest onespaid zero in income taxes last year after making $40 billion in profits.
I'm a capitalist. If you can make a million or a billion dollars, have at it. Just pay your fair share. That's all I'm asking. That's why the Build Back Better plan has a minimum tax that makes sure that large, profitable corporations start paying their fair share. And we got passed, internationally, a provision that a 15-percent minimum is paid in every single country so you don't have countries fleeing here with technology to go other places because they have a lower tax rate.
The first major piece of legislation in more than a decadeand it's not only fully paid for. Based on official estimates from the Congressional Budget Office, the Joint Committee on Taxation, the Treasury Department, it's going to generate more than $100 billion in deficit reduction this decade.
So, look, I know some people have said this bill isn't fiscally responsible enough. Because even though it's fully paid for, they acknowledge; even though it would reduce the deficit, which they acknowledge; even though it represents the first time in over a decade that we're doing the hard work of offsetting investments with new revenue, some of the programs may get extended. And if they get extended, they say, it's going to cost more money. We didn't count that in.
Well, that's true. Congress is going to pay for those as well. After years of Republican leadership in Washington passing tax giveaways to the superwealthy, new spending without even giving a thought about how to pay for itthey added $8 trillion to the national debt with the Trump tax cut$8 trillion.
I welcome a serious conversation about how to pay for the investments we make, but here is what those critics are not telling you. They're not telling you that I've committed to paying for every single program that extended, if any are, in future legislation, whether that's for a day or a decade.
And here's what else they're not telling you. They're not telling you why it is that they're fighting so hard against lowering the prices of prescription drugs or childcare or eldercare or health care; why it is that they're so frightened, so hard tofighting so incredibly hard to protect the 2017 Trump tax cuts that increase the deficit alone by nearly $2 trillionthe bulk of which went to large corporations and virtually none of it paid for. I'm happy to have that debate onabout how to pay for these priorities.
In my Build Back Better plan, we're already undoing some of the most reckless elements of the Trump tax bill, like ending the tax breaks for companies sending jobs overseas. We've got awe got a tax cut for sending a job overseas. But other tax giveaways in the bill that expire. That bill expires in 2025; it has to be reauthorized. For example, the tax rate for the 1 percent wealthiest Americans used to be 39.6 percent. You make it soundthey make it sound like it used to be 70 percent or something39.6 percent, what it was in the Bush administration.
The Trump tax cut cut that to 37 percent. Just by restoring that tax back to 39.7what it was in the Bush yearsjust by doing that would generate an additional $20 billion a year in revenueenough to pay for universal preschool for all 3- and 4 years old, all the way through.
So, folks, we're going to face a choice. Do we keep giving tax cuts to the wealthiest 1 percent of the taxpayers or do we keep lowering costs for working families? You know, weI think we have something like 730-some billionaires in America. That's fine. You make a billion dollars; I'm okay with that.
But you know what? You know how much money, when everybody was losing money during the recessionthe prerecessionyou know how much money those 739, I think it is, made? Another trillion dollars. You hear me now?
Those 735whatever the number ismade an additional trillion dollars in that year and a half. Trillion. I didn't hear anybody weeping and gnashing their teeth[laughter]about any of that.
If they want to argue about continuing tax cuts for big corporations and the wealthiest Americans is more important than lowering the cost of childcare, lowering prescription drug prices, that's an argument I'm happy to have. I'm looking forward to that debate.
One of the reasons I believe so firmly in the proposal is because I know what this country can be. We've always been a nation of possibilities. I was asked by Xi JinpingI travelI spent, with him, more time than any other world leader. And I was in17,000 miles with him in China. And he turned to me in one of our many one-on-one meetingswith an interpreter, eachand asked me, said, ""Can you define America for me?"" I said, ""Yes."" I said, ""One word: possibilities.""
Think about it. No other nation in the worldone of the reasons why we think we're ugly Americans is, no other nation in the world believes that anything we set our minds to, we can do. Because when we've done it, we've never failed. Folks, we didn't become this Nation we know by dreaming small. Throughout our history, we've emerged from crisis by investing in ourselves.
During and after the Civil War, we builtduring the Civil War, it startedthe transcontinental railroad, uniting the East Coast and the West Coast. During the cold war, we built the Interstate Highway Systemtransformed how Americans live their lives. And now we're going to build an economy of the 21st century.
I truly believe that 50 years from nowand I mean this from the bottom of my hearthistorians are going to look back on this moment and the next several years, and they're going to say that this was the moment when America won the competition for the 21st century. Because if we don't, we're going to lose it. We going to lose it.
So, folks, there's nothing we can't do. When the American people set their mind to something, there's never been anything we cannot do. And there's never been a crisis we've got into that we haven't come out stronger than before we went into it. That's who we are. That's America.
Well, God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. And thanks for your patience.

2021-10-21 00:00:00,"Remarks and a Question-and-Answer Session at a CNN Presidential Town Hall in Baltimore, Maryland","
CNN Anchor Anderson Cooper. So, with that, I want to welcome the 46th President of the United States, President Joe Biden. How are you, sir? So there's a lot to get to tonight, and we've got a lot of great questions from our audience. We want to get into the details of what you're calling the Build Back Better plan.
Before we get into that though, I just want to knowthere's been a lot of negotiating going on behind the scenes, as I'm sure you are very involved with. [Laughter] Are you close to a done deal?
The President's Legislative Agenda 
The President. No problems. It's all done. [Laughter]
No, look, Anderson, we've beenI've probably spent, well, well over a hundred hours. This is a big deal. We're both havewe have two plans: one is the infrastructure planroads, highways, bridges, buses, trains, et ceteraand the other one is what I call the ""care economy"". It has a lot of money in there for environmental remediation as well as care economy. For example, you know, we want to get the economy moving, but millions of women can't go to work because they don't have any childcare. That kind of thing.
So there's a lot of pieces in there. There's a lot that people don't understand. And by the way, all of it's paid for, every single penny. It's not going to raise one single cent to the debt.
Mr. Cooper. We're going to get into a lot of those details. Just, though, are you close to a deal?
The President. I think so. You know, look, I've beenI was a Senator for 370 years. [Laughter] And I was neverI was relatively good at putting together deals.
Gun Control Legislation 
Mr. Cooper. Is this the toughest deal you've worked on?
The President. No. No. I think banning assault weapons was the toughest deal I worked onand succeeded.
Mr. Cooper. You're flying to Europe, I think, in 8 days.
The President. Yes.
The President's Economic Plan/Bipartisanship 
Mr. Cooper. Do you think you'll have a deal by the time you get on Air Force One in 8 days?
The President. Well, look, you know, it's like my asking you, ""Are you sure your next show is going to be a success?"" Right? You know.
Mr. Cooper. Yes. [Laughter]
The President. Well, you're more confident than I am. [Laughter] Lookhey, look, it's all about compromise. You know, ""compromise"" has become a dirty word, but it'sbipartisanship and compromise still has to be possible.
When I ran for the Presidency, I said I'm running for three reasons: one, to restore the soul and decency in the country; two, to build the middle class and the working class so they werewe build from the middle out; and three, to actually unite the country. And everybody has been saying: ""Well, that's crazy. You can't do it."" If we can't eventually unite this country, we're in deep trouble.
Mr. Cooper. Bottom line: Do you think you will get a deal?
The President. I do think I'll get a deal.
Mr. Cooper. All right, let's get somelet's go to the audience. This is Nicholas Vaught. He's the coordinator at the Applied Liberal Studies Program at Morgan State University. He's a Democrat.
Nicholas, your question.
The President. Morgan State.
Child and Dependent Care Assistance/Child Tax Credit 
Q. Morgan State.
The President. All right, man. I've spoken there.
Q. Yes. So my wife and I have two young boys, Arthur and Teddy. However, the cost of childcare is nearly double our mortgage. We want to have more children, but even though we earn a good salary now, childcare is so expensive. So how will this new infrastructure plan help middle class families pay for childcare?
The President. Well, let me ask you: Do you havehow old are your kids?
Q. Three and a half and six months old.
The President. God love you. [Laughter]
Well, look, there's two pieces. There's the childcarehaving someone take care of your child while you are working, while you and your wife are working. Under this proposal I have, no one will have to payunless you're making more thanindividually, you're each makingmaking over 300 grand$150,000 apiece.
Q. We're educators.
The President. Oh, good. [Laughter] And by the way, I'm married to one: Dr. Biden, right here.
So you will not have to pay more than 7 percent of your income for childcare7 percent. And the way we do that is, we provide for the ability to have childcare centers funded. The money won't even goyou don'tthefigure your income; you get 7 percent with the total cost.
But there's another piece here: You now are qualified to be able to have a child tax credit. It used to be that when youyou know, when youif you werehad enough money to pay significant taxes, you could write off 2,000 bucks for every child you had and reduce it from your taxes. But if you were making 60,000 bucks a year and you didn't have that much to write off, you didn't get anything.
Well, I call this a taxbreak for middle-class people. If you're making in the $150,000 range right now, you're in a situation where you can get, if you have a child under 7, $350; if you have a child over 7, between 7 and 17, you can get $300. And you get a direct payment. You canthe IRS sends you money.
Child Tax Credit 
Mr. Cooper. TheJoe Manchin wants a work requirement with your enhanced tax credit for kids. Is that something you would support?
The President. No. Here's the deal: All these people are working anyway.
And by the way, you know, why should somebody who is not working and hasyou know, makeshas a million-dollar trust fund, why should they get the benefit, and someone making 60 grand and not working, but staying home, why should they not get anything? I don't get that.
Mr. Cooper. You're also proposing, for the first time ever, Federal paid parental leave. And
The President. Yes. That's a different issue. Yes.
Paid Family Leave 
Mr. Cooper. Right. A different issue. Right. But this isbut this is in your proposal. How much time off would parents actually get under your proposal? Because at one point, you talked about 12 weeks. Now there's reports it's down to maybe 4 weeks.
The President. Yes, it is down to 4 weeks. And the reason it's down to 4 weeks is, I can't get 12 weeks. [Laughter]
Andbut look, here's the deal, guys: How many people do you knownot a jokeor maybe yourselfhave had a circumstance where you are working like the devil, you're making 7 bucks an hour, 15 bucks an hour, or 20 bucks an hour, and you have a child that's sick at homeor you have a mother or a father, husband and wife, son or daughter, and you need to stay home to help them?
We're one of the few industrial countries in the world that doesn't have paid leaveso that when you stay home to help that person, to take care of that person, you're still getting your pay. And it does not hurt the business at all. The business isn't paying for it; the Federal Government is paying for it. It's a little bit like, as I said, a tax cut for people who are not able to otherwise take care of their families.
And look, I'm looking out here, and a lot of you are part of that sandwich generation: You have young kids, and you have aging parents. And one of the things all the polling data shows, Anderson, is people are more concerned about taking care of the elderly, because they don't know what to do, than they are even their children.
Mr. Cooper. I want to talk about this. I want you to meet Vanessa Antrum from Bowie, Maryland. She's retired. She's a caregiver for her elderly parents.
The President. God love you.
Mr. Cooper. She's a Democrat. Vanessa, your question.
Medicare and Medicaid/Homecare and Eldercare Assistance 
Q. Yes. Mr. President, my parents have been married for 73 years and both are dealing[applause]. Yes. Both of them are dealing with dementia. My father, who was a veteran, is completely bedridden, and my mom is experiencing issues with walking.
I have found the process for me to provide care for them in my home very hard. They have worked all their life only for me to experience a lot of redtape to provide supports
The President. Bingo.
Q. in a loving home environment. What is being done to support the elderly, especially for a middle class family like mine?
The President. Well, first of allif my mom were here, she'd say you're a good daughter, number one.
Q. Yes. Thank you.
The President. Number two, I was in a situation like you, where I was making more moneyI was making $42,000 a year as a Senator at the time, although I was listed the poorest man in the Senate for 36 years, but[laughter]I still made more money than most people because Senate salaries kept going up.
What happened was, my dad got sick, and he was in hospice, so Jill and I took my dad home, and we took care of him in our house. But we were lucky because we had the ability to haveI have a sister who is an angel and a brother who's a wonderful guy, and we all took turns in our house taking care of them.
But here's the deal: Right now, under Medicaid, there are 860,000I think it's 860don't hold me to the exact number, but it's over 800,000who qualify for home health care aid for their parents, but there's no money there. There's no money there.
So what we do is, we provide the funding for Medicaid to allow you to be able to keepif your parents had their homekeeping them in their home if you wanted, or get help in your home with homecare from professionals providinghelping you take care of themhelping you take care of them.
And in many cases where you're not taking care of them in your own home and they're stayingand they're staying in their home, you're going to be able to have the ability to have someone come in and make their meals for them. They don't have to be there 24/7.
So there's a lot of things we're doing. In addition to the process, we're going to be able to train up those homecare workers who are usually minority women, women of color, as well as immigrants. And they have the capacity to learn more as they go along, to move to the point where they can become practical nurses and things like that.
So it'sit makes a lot of sense, and it's cheapercheaperthan it is to not do it.
Medicare and Medicaid Expansion Efforts/Senator Joseph A. Manchin III 
Mr. Cooper. One of the other things that Democrats are looking to do is to expand Medicare to include dental, vision, and hearing as well. Given all the negotiations that are going on, will all three of those still be covered?
The President. That's a reach. And the reason why it's a reachit's notI think it's a good idea, and it's not that costly in relative terms, especially if we allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices.
But here's the thing: Mr. Manchin isis opposed to that, as isI think Senator Sinema is as well.
Mr. Cooper. Opposed to all of them?
The President. Opposed to all three. Because they don't wanthe says he doesn't want to further burden Medicare so thatbecause it will run out of its ability to maintain itself in x number of years. There's ways to fix that, but he's not interested in that part either. [Laughter]
But look, JoeJoe is not a bad guy. He's a friend. And he's always, at the end of the day, come around and voted for it.
But here's the point: We're in a situation now where if you are in a circumstance that you're not able to providelet me cut to the chase; I'm taking too long. [Laughter]
One of the things we were able to do in the meantime isthe most expensive of these things would be dental. Okay? Now, we're talking aboutand I don't have a deal on it yetmaybe getting an $800 voucher from Medicare for dental work that you may need.
And the hearing is a very important thing becauseas Kyrsten Sinema, who supports this, points outhearing is directly related to dementia. When you can't hear, you have a problem, and it impacts on dementia.
So we're able to, Iand it's cheaper to be able to take care of the hearing. But I think I've been able to take care of that without changing Medicare, because what's happening is, now you have these hearing aid companies; you no longer are going to have to go to the doctor and spend 5 grand and get an appointmentyou can go buy at Walgreens, and buy over-the-counter hearing aids.
Sothe harder one, though, is wewe haven't gotten a consensus yet on how to deal with seeing, glasses. Andbut that'sso ""it's not done yet"" is the answer.
Mr. Cooper. All right. I want to get another question in. This is Ben Frederick. Ben is a realtor, a lifelong resident of Baltimore. He's an independent. Serves on the Maryland Multi-Housing Association.
The President. By the way, Ben, the Bidens all hail from Baltimore, beginning in 1850. [Laughter] I don't know how the hell they kicked me out, but I'm[laughter].
Mr. Cooper. Ben, what's your question?
Tax Code Reform/Corporate Tax Rate 
Q. IRS data shows that the top 5 percent of income earners pays 60 percent of the income taxes in this country. I hear you repeatedly say that the wealthy are not paying their fair share of income taxes. What is the percentage of income that you believe is fair?
The President. Well, I think what's fair is thatthis present Tax Code, the highest tax rate is 35 percent, number one. Okay?
Number two, you're in a circumstance where corporate America is not paying their fair share. And I come from the corporate State of the world: Delaware. More corporations in Delaware than every other State in the union combined. Okay?
Now, here's the deal though: You have 55 corporations, for example, in the United States of America making over $40 billion don't pay a cent. Not a single little red cent.
Now, I don't careI'm a capitalist. I hope you can be a millionaire or a billionaire. Inot a problem. But at least pay your fair share. Chip in a little bit.
And so
Corporate Tax Rate 
Mr. Cooper. Well, let melet me follow up, because Kyrsten Sinema, who you mentionedSenator Sinema is opposed to any tax rate hikes for corporations and for high earners. Speaker Pelosi suggested today she could accept that.
The question is: A, would you accept thatno rate hikestax rate hikes for corporations or high earners? And if so, how would you pay for this plan otherwise?
The President. Because you don't havelook, here's the deal: The tax ratethe corporate tax rate was 35 points-something37 percent. Barack and I thought it should come down. We thought it should come down to 28 percent.
In the process, it came down to 21 percent under Trump, which even the corporate leadersand you know if you're in real estatemajor real estate. Ask them. They know they should be paying a little more than 21 percent. Because the idea that if you're a schoolteacher and a firefighter, you're paying at a higher tax rate than they are, as a percentage of your taxes.
But here's the deal: I believe that we can do thewe can pay for this whole thingI have it written on a card here, but I won't bore you with the detail. But, for example, if you in fact made sure that you paid a minimum 15 percentminimum 15 percentif you're paying nothingminimum 15that's almostthat's over almost $400 billion over 10 years.
Tax Code Reform 
Mr. Cooper. So you would be willing to go along with what Senator Sinema and, it seems like, Speaker Pelosi is willing to consider: no tax hike for corporations or for high-earning individuals?
The President. Here's what I'm willing to do: I'm willing to make sure that we pay for everything without anyone making less than $400,000 paying a single cent more in taxes. That's my objective.
And so there's ways to do that. For exampleyou covered it on your showthe minimum international tax at 15 percent.
Mr. Cooper. But no rateactual rate hikes?
The President's Economic Agenda 
The President. No. No. I don't think we're going to be able to get to vote. Look[laughter]when you're in the United States Senate and you're a President of the United States and you have 50 Democrats, every one is a President. [Laughter] Every single one. So you've got to work things out.
But where I am is, I'm hearing nowI'll turn on the news, and I'll hear that ""Biden's caved on such and""look, Biden has a simple proposition. Biden is going to getall the elements of these two bills have profound impact on economic growth; reduce, not increase, inflation; don't add a penny to the debt; as well as grow the economy. AccordingI have 17 Nobel laureates in economics sent me a letter recently saying that my proposals would actually reduce inflation, diminish inflation.
But here's the point. The point of it all is that I'm preparedI can't think of anything that was consequential in changing the circumstance for the middle class and working class in America that came as a consequence of a single piece of legislation.
I've got a portrait of Roosevelt in my office. Okay? Social Security is not anything like it is today when he passed it. It evolved. It moved. It grew.
So I'm prepared to do the things that can get done now that can begin to change the lives of ordinary Americans to give them a fighting chance and come back and try to get others later.
Mr. Cooper. Let's talk about another one of those things. This is Sondra Guttman, an English professor at Loyola University, also a Democrat.
Sondra, what's your question?
The President. And by the way, you've got another English professor who teaches writing here. [Laughter]
Global Competitiveness/Early Childhood Education 
Q. Thank you for taking my question, Mr. President. We've heard in the news that the proposal for 2 years of free community college may be cut from your economic package. An educated citizenry is absolutely crucial to solving complex problems like climate change and the systematic inequities in this country. We hope that this is not cut from the package, but if it is, what can you do to ensure that all Americans can get the education that they need to face these issues?
The President. Well, first of all, Professor, you made a very profound point, and I'm notI'm not being sarcasticand that isand Jill uses a slightly different phrase: ""Any country that outeducates us will outcompete us."" Any country that outeducates willouteducates will outcompete us.
You have the vast majorityof the 37 major countries in the worldeconomieswe rank 35 in our investment in education. We're in a situation where if you think about it, when wewhat caused us to move ahead and dominate the 20th century: In the late 1900sin the early 1900s, late 1890s, we came upwe said, 12 years of free education. That was revolutionary at the time. I mean, seriously.
Now, if we were sitting down today and saying, ""Oh, we've got to put together an education system,"" raise your hand if anybody thinks 12 years is enough to compete in the 21st century? So that's why what I propose is: free childfree schoolfree school for every 3- and 4-year-old in America, no matter what their background.
All the data shows that no matter what home they come from, they increase exponentially their prospects of succeeding all the way through 12 years of school. You allyou know all the statistics.
The statistics go that if you come from a home where there's no books in the home and a single mom or a single dad, they don'tthey're not well educated, they don't talk a lot, the kid from the middle classaverage middle class home versus that home will go to school having heard 1 million more words spoken than the child who didn't. A gigantic disadvantage. So
Community College/Federal Postsecondary Education Assistance 
Mr. Cooper. Mr. President, the question was ontheon community colleges
The President. No, I know. I
Mr. Cooper. which was a big campaign promise that you made. You talked about that a lot on
The President. Oh, I
Mr. Cooper. the campaign trail.
The President. Yes, and I'm going to get it done. And if I don't, I'll be sleeping alone for a long time. [Laughter]
But here's the deal: So far, Mr. Manchin and one other person has indicated they will not support free community college. So what I'vewhat I think we can get done is, we can significantly increase the amount of money by 500 bucks a payment for Pell grants. And Pell grants are available, and they can apply for up to 30 percent of the cost of community college and/orand/orcollege, help tuition.
So it's not going to get us there. It's not going to get us the whole thing, but it is a start.
I'm convincedabsolutely, positively convinced that we're going to be able toand, by the way, we have in the lawin the legislation, money for community colleges that deal withdealing with apprenticeships, dealing with teaching people particular skills that are not gettingwill not get you a 2-year degree, but will teach you the skill.
So I think we can get all of that done this time out. But I promise youI guarantee you, we're going to get free community college in the next several years, I mean, across the board.
Mr. Cooper. What was that conversation when you realized you weren't ablegoing to be able to get it in this bill at this time, and you had dinner with Dr. Biden that night, what was that conversation like? [Laughter] How did you break that news?
Community College/Global Competitiveness 
The President. Well, the White House has a lot of bedrooms. [Laughter] And she went like this. [Laughter]
[At this point, the President pointed his finger.]
""Down the hall.""
Mr. Cooper. All right.
The President. No, look, it really makes a gigantic difference. And think of this: You have more countries in the world withhavingproviding collegeI mean, providing professional education beyond 12 years. We rank like, I think it'sdon't hold me to the numberI think it's 16 or 17 in the worldthe United States of America, for God's sake.
Mr. Cooper. I want
The President. This is about putting us in the game.
Mr. Cooper. This is John Meche. He's a doctoral candidate at Morgan State University and an independent. John, welcome. What's your question?
The President. Wherewhere are you?
Mr. Cooper. Morgan State.
Q. Morgan State.
The President. I know all these Morgan men, man.
I've spoken there a couple times. And by the way, the guy who runs my operation is aanyway[laughter]I keep talking about Delaware State, but they keep saying about Morgan State, you know?
Infrastructure and Jobs Legislation/Education and Family Assistance Legislation 
Q. Morgan State. President Biden, I had so much faith in your election win, but based on history, the bipartisan efforts of the Democratic Party are held hostage by rogue moderates and Republicans. Why not do like the Republicans and usher through the Democratic agenda?
The President. Well, two reasons. If you notice, the Republicans haven't passed a single, solitary thing. Zero. So, ushering through their agendatheir agenda right now is just ""stop Biden."" Although, I shouldn't make it so personal. ""Stop my administration""that's what the agenda is. It's much easier to stop something than to start something.
And look, what we did is, when I wroteI'm going to back up just a second. I apologize. I wroteI personallyduring the campaign, before I got elected, I wrote the infrastructure bill relating to what we do to highways and all that kind of thing. Hardhard data. And I wrote thewhat they callwhat's now called the ""care economy"" piece and has a gigantic piece of environmental pieces in it too.
And I went before the joint session of Congress, and I laid out exactly what I was for. And so, I made it clear what I was for. Initially what happened was, I got no support for anything from our Republican friends. And then they said, ""Maybe we can work out a bipartisan deal on infrastructure."" And we did. We worked on it. It didn't give me everything I wanted. It didn't have as much money in there for the environment, although it has tens of billions of dollars in there, but didn't have what I wanted in it. But we made a bipartisan deal.
Now, what's coming along is this reconciliationthey call it a fancy wordfor the other pieces that have the childcare pieces, have the economy that relates to allowing people towomen to go back to work. It has about $450 billion for environmental remediation and so on.
And that's the one that is the issue.
Senator Kyrsten L. Sinema/The President's Economic Agenda 
Mr. Cooper. Well, let melet me ask youjust getting to his question: Youwe've talked a lot about Senator Manchin and Senator Sinema. You seem relatively confident you can kind of get Senator Manchin on board.
Youthere's a lot of Democrats in the House and Senate who are confused about where Senator Sinema actually stands on things. And I know she's been negotiating directly with you and the White House. What is your read on her?
And Iobviously, you need her to remain positive in your direction, so I don't know what you're going to say. [Laughter] But what is your read on her?
The President. No, seriously.
Mr. Cooper. Do you know where she stands?
The President. First of all, she's smart as the devil, number one. Number two, she's very supportive of the environmental agenda in my legislationvery supportive. She's supportive of allalmost all the things I mentioned, relating to everything from family care to all those issues.
Where she's not supportive is she says she will not raise a single penny in taxes on the corporate side and/or on wealthy people. Period. And so that's where it sort of breaks down, and there's a few other issues it breaks down on.
But what we're trying to do is reach a point here where I'm able to present to the Senatethey're able to vote onand the Housea serious, serious piece of legislation that changes the dynamic for working class folks in America and middle class folks, and begins to have the very wealthy and corporations just begin to pay their fair sharenot a lot.
How we get therewe're down to four or five issues, which I'm not going to negotiate on national television, as you might guess.
Mr. Cooper. We'd be interested
The President. No, no, no.
Mr. Cooper. in hearing them, if you want. [Laughter]
The President. No, no, no. I know. But, all kidding aside, I think we can get there.
Mr. Cooper. You talked about the environmental piece. You said Senator Sinema is on board with that. Certainly, Senator Manchin is not. It gets to our next question.
This is from Kobi Khong. He's originally from Anaheim, California. He's a sophomore class president at Johns Hopkins University, a Democrat.
Kobi, what's your question?
The President. Mr. President. [Laughter]
Climate Change/Paris Agreement 
Q. One of the largest issues that people have trouble comprehending the severity of is climate change. Many legislators and politicians today are lenient, as they won't have to live with the future effects. Without the legislative support for the climate aspects of your budget proposal and the earth rapidly approaching the Paris Agreement's 1.5 degrees limit, what other backup plans do you have to ensure a future for the next generations?
The President. Well, that's[applause]. Mr. President, you've got it right. The existential threat to humanity is climate change. And when President Trump pulled out of the Paris accordwhich, when I was with the Obama administration, we helped negotiatethe agreement was that we could notif we reached beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius increase in temperature, we're gone. Not a joke. Not a joke.
And so we decided thathe pulled out. First thing I committed to do is rejoin that accord, number one. But number twonumber two: What you have to do, is you look atthere's multiple ways in which we can deal with climate. I'm going off to COP26 in Scotland, andin, I don't know, I guess it's 2 weeks or a week. I can'tI'm losing track of time.
And I'm presenting a commitment to the world that we will, in fact, get to net-zero emissions on electric power by 2035 and net-zero emissions across the board by 2050 or before. But we have to do so much between now and 2030 to demonstrate what we're going tothat we're going to do.
So let me give you a couple examples.
Climate Measures in the Budget Reconciliation Package/Senator Joseph A. Manchin III/Energy Efficiency and Weatherization 
Mr. Cooper. Can Ilet me just follow up, though, very quickly on that, because the key climate provision that was in the Build Back Better plan, as you call itthe Clean Electricity Performance Programthat's been dropped now from this spending bill. Reported
The President. No, it hasn't.
Mr. Cooper. It has not?
The President. No, it hasn'tlook
Mr. Cooper. But Senator Manchin is opposed to that.
The President. He's opposed to it. But here's the deal: That is only one of well overwell over a trillion dollars' worth of expenditures for climate change. It's $150 billion. It's important.
And what it says is that if in fact the utility doesn't pull back and continue to reduce the amount of carbon that they emit, that what will happen is they will end up paying a penalty. And so there's a penalty incurred.
Joe Manchin's argument is: Look, we still have coal in my State. You're going to eliminate it eventually. We know it's going away. We know it's going to be gone. But don't rush it so fast that my people don't have anything to do.
I think that's not what we should be doing, but the fact of the matter is, we can take that $150 billion, add it to the $320 billion that's in thein the law now that he's prepared to support for tax incentivestax incentivesto have people act in a way that they're going to be able to do the things that need to be do fromfor example, if you'reif you've got windows that are the, you know, the wind is blowing through, you get an incentive to put new windows in your home. You getyouhelp get it paid.
We're going to significantly reduce the amountthe cost of solar panels on your roof. We're going to continuallyand, for example, there's new battery technologies that are beingI went out in Silicon Valley; there's a battery that's about that wide and about that thick. If you have solar power, you put that in your basement and the sun doesn't shine for 7 days, you still have all the power you need.
Energy Grid Improvement Efforts/Climate Resilience Measures 
Mr. Cooper. But the concession has been agreed to for Senator Manchin
The President. No, no, no.
Mr. Cooper. about coal in his State.
The President. No, no
Mr. Cooper. Is that true?
The President. Nothing has been formally agreed to. The concession has beenthe negotiation is: I've been saying to Joe: ""Look, I'll takeif we don't do it in terms of the electric grid piece, what we'll do isgive me that $150 billion. I'm going to add it to be able to do other things that allow me to do things that don't directly affect the electric grid in the way that there's a penalty, but allow me to spend the money to set new technologies in place.""
Mr. Cooper. Okay.
The President. For example, we can save significant amounts of money and, as a consequence of that, significant amounts of energy, if in fact we are able to put the high-tension wires underground. It costs a hell of a lot more to do it. It creates real good jobs; it creates a hell of a lot more to do it. But, in fact, it would do a lot to keep things from happening that are dangerous. Half the forest fires out West are those towers coming down, setting fires, et cetera.
So there's a lot of things Joe is open to my convincing him that I can use it to increase environmental progress without it being that particular deal.
Mr. Cooper. We're going to take a quick break. When we get back, we got a lot more questions for President Biden.
[There was a commercial break.]
Mr. Cooper. And welcome back. We are live at a CNN town hall event in Baltimore, Maryland, with President Joe Biden.
Coronavirus Pandemic Effects on the Labor Market/Coronavirus Vaccination Efforts/Morale of the Country 
So, before we get to our next question, I want to just bring up the current labor market shortages. Millions of jobs are unfilled, businesses are struggling to meet demand. Is there anything you can do to either encourage people to go back to work or make jobs more attractive that they want to go back to work?
The President. Yes, so, first
Mr. Cooper. Is there a role for the Federal Government?
The President. First of all, we've created more jobs in the first 8 months of my Administration than any President in American historytotal number of jobs created.
But the problem for the people not going back to work is twofold. Number one, they're reluctant to go back to work because they're afraid of COVID, many of them. So they don't want to go back, and they don't want to be exposed to either the customers, because they're not required to wear masks or not required to have shots, or they don't want to go back because they're not sure of the people waiting on them and theyat the table, or the people coming up in the food market. So a lot of it has to do with COVID. Number one.
Number twoand that's why, you know, we were able to go fromwhen I first got electedwhen I first was elected, there were only 2 million people who had COVID shots in the United States of Americahad the vaccine. Now we got 190 million, because I went out and bought everything I could doand buy in sight, and it worked.
But here's the deal: The second thingthe second thing that has happened, Anderson, is that people are now using this as an opportunity to say, ""Wait a minute, do I want to go back to that $7-an-hour job?""
I won't name the particular restaurant chain, but they found out when theythey couldn't hire anybody. When they found out, they started to pay 20 bucks an hour, everybody wanted to go back to work. Not a joke.
So what you see is, wages are actually up for those who are working, because for the first time in a long time, employees are able to bargain. ""You're the boss? You want me to work for you? What are you going to pay me? How are you going to do it?"" I'm not being facetious.
The third thing that's out there is, there's a circumstance that exists where people are really worried about what they're going to doI mean, how can I say this?
How many people do you knowand maybe some in this audiencewho, because of what you've been througha loss of a husband, wife, brother, mother, father, son, whateveror you've had something that's really impacted you with COVID that you really find yourself just down? I mean just down. And so, there's a lot of people who are just down. They're not sure how to get back in the game. They're not sure whether they want to get back in the game.
Think of this: If you're graduating from Morgan State, okay? Right? Well, guess what? You didn't have those great dances the last 4 years that you'd had before you went out at Morgan. No, I'm not joking. Graduated from high school, you don't have your prom, you don't have your graduation, you don't have the thingall the things that matter to people that go into things they look forward to. So a lot of it has to do with us getting back on our feet and getting back on our feet in terms of our attitudes about what the future looks like for us.
Mental Health Services 
Mr. Cooper. What do you say to someone who's down? Because
The President. What I say
Mr. Cooper. there's a lot of people watching tonight who are.
The President. Well, there are. And I tell you what: There's plenty of help. Look, being down, having some problem in terms of needing somesome adviceif you have a broken spirit, it's no different than a broken arm. You shouldn't be ashamed of it. You should seek the help. There's a lot of people who can help.
Andbut I really mean it.
Mr. Cooper. Yes.
The President. I don'tI'm not saying that's the whole problem, but I'm saying it is an element in terms of attitude about peoplewhat they want tolook, how often I get asked the question: ""What's Christmas going to be like? How about Thanksgiving? Is it going to be okay? I mean, what's going to happen? I mean, how will I be able to buy gifts for my kids?"" Howthere's a lot of anxiety people have.
Mr. Cooper. Yes. I want to ask a question along the lines of concern about Christmas and holidays and the supply chain.
Anna Hirsch is here, a student at Loyola University, who is originally from Connecticut. She's a Democrat. Anna, what's your question?
The President. Hello, Anna.
Global Supply Chain Disruptions 
Q. President Biden, growing up in a small town, I've been surrounded by small-business owners, including my mom who owns her own interior design business. With the current supply chain crisis, small businesses are in jeopardy of not being able to get products that they need
The President. They are.
Q. because priority is given to large businesses. Does your administration have any policies or plans in place to aid the current supply chain problem and/or to help small businesses that are affected by this?
The President. Yes on both. Herebut you have it exactly right. We have a significant supply chain problem.
In the Obama-Biden administration, all of American businessand it made senseit was ""just on time."" You wanted to make sure that you didn't waste any money and/or time between producing whatever you're producing and having it done. You didn'tso that's how you saved money. You didn't buy the material 6 months ahead of time and then keep it in your inventory and then move it. It was on time.
Now, that's a big problem. You can'tpeople can't do it. They want to get out ahead. What I've recently doneand people saiddoubted we could get it done. I was able to go to the private ports40 percent of all products coming into the United States of America on the West Coast go through Los Angeles andoh, what am I doing here?
Mr. Cooper. Is it Long Beach or
The President. Long Beach. Thank you.
And I know both the mayors. So I went to them, and I said, ""What can we do?"" So I met withand they're privately owned, these portsthese two. So I met with the business people. I met with all their major customersthe Walmarts of the world and all the rest. There are like 70 ships waiting out there unable to get unloaded.
So Iand becausenot alwaysthe longshoremen don't always get along with the business folks in there. I gotI have a relationship with them. And I brought them together, and I said: ""You've got to be open 24/7."" No port there was openopen 5 days a week, 40 hours a week. 24/7they've all agreed to it. They've agreed to it.
National Guard/Port Infrastructure Improvements 
Mr. Cooper. Would you consider the National Guard to help with the supply chain issue?
The President. Yes, absolutely, positively, I would do that. But in addition to that, what you've got to do is, you've got to get these ships in and unloaded.
And one of the things in my infrastructure plan: There's $16 billion for port expansion. We have to be able to move things along. Because what's happening is, when wea product your mother may need for interior design, in terms of drapery or colors or something, that is imported from somewhere else. Well, guess what? A lot of these places, particularly in South Asia, are closing down because of COVID. The businesses are just flat closing. They're-
Global Supply Chain Disruptions 
Mr. Cooper. So would you consider the National Guard for trucking? Forbecause there's a lot of problems
The President. Yes.
Mr. Cooper. with not enough truck drivers right now.
The President. Yes. But here'sand that's why what we're doing now
Mr. Cooper. Do you have a timetable for that?
The President. Well, I had a timetable tofirst of all, I want to get the ports up and running, and get the railroads and the rail heads and the trucks in port ready to move. Because I've gotten Walmart and others that say, ""We're going to move stuff off of the port, into our warehouses.""which they weren't doing.
Mr. Cooper. So are youbut you're actually talking about having National Guardsmen and women
The President. The answer is
Mr. Cooper. driving trucks?
The President. The answer is: Yes, if we can't move theincrease the number of truckers, which we're in the process of doing.
Mr. Cooper. Okay.
The President. If we did at this moment, we're notbut the whole point is: We've got to get the small business as well, because the big guys are in trouble. And a lot of the product that your mother makes, the product shethe things she does in her interior design building, the material she buys from the larger outfits. I assume; I don't know that.
I shouldn'tbut my whole point is: Small businesses need the help badly. Small businesses make up 60 percent of all the revenue coming from business out there.
Mr. Cooper. I want to bring in Linda Harris. She's from Elkridge, Maryland. She's a software project manager, Democrat. Linda, what's your question?
Q. Hey, President Biden.
The President. Hey.
Economic Stimulus Payments 
Q. My middle-class family of four lives on a pretty tight budget. My husband and I both work full-time at well-paying jobs, but we still struggle some months to make the ends meet. With rising gas prices and utility prices and grocery prices, we're feeling our discretionary income get squeezed and reduced. What plans does the administration have to help ease this kind of current crunch we're feeling?
The President. Well, there's a number of things that have already been done. And it's hardand people don't think aboutthe American Rescue Plan has provided for an awful lotthe $1.9 billion we passed right atright after I got elected.
So what you got is, you got thatthat $1,400 check in the mail, and you got a lot of things that help ameliorate some of the concerns and costs, because we knew what we were coming into. We knew we had inherited the wind, and things were going to get worse before they got better.
But in terms of being able to have what my dad used to say, ""a little breathing room,"" just a littlemy dad busted his neck. He didn't have a good-paying job. My dad was a well-read, high school-educated guy who thought his greatest sin in the world was he didn't get to go to college.
Andbut my dad was one of those guys that worked like hell, would come home for dinner, and then he'd go back and finish up work and close the shop. Heand the whole point of it was that all we want to giveall he'd talk about is, ""Joey, all I need is just a little breathing room, a little spacea little space.""
Inflation/Gasoline Prices 
Mr. Cooper. Let melet me ask you about that, just in terms of inflation, because you had told us at a town hall, I think it was in July, that thethis was just near-term inflation. The Wall Street Journal recently talked to like 67 financial experts who said that they saw high inflation going all the wayor deep into 2022. Do you think it's going to last for a while?
The President. I don't think so. I don't think it will last ifdepending what we do. If we stay exactly where we are, yes. If we don't make these investments, yes.
Mr. Cooper. What about gas prices? Because some States
The President. Gas price
Mr. Cooper. are seeing
The President. Gas prices relate to a foreign policy initiative that is about something that goes beyond the cost of gas. And we're about $3.30 a gallon most places now, when it's up fromwhen it was down in the single digits. I meansinglea dollar-plus. And that's because of the supply being withheld by OPEC.
And so there's a lot of negotiation that isthere's a lot of Middle Eastern folks who want to talk to me. I'm not sure I'm going to talk to them. But the point is, it's about gas production. There's things we can do, in the meantime, though.
Mr. Cooper. Do you think there's aI mean, do you see ado you have a timeline for gas prices of when you think they may start coming down?
Gasoline Prices/Home Heating Assistance/Renewable Energy/Automobile Industry/Strategic Petroleum Reserve 
The President. My guess is, you'll start to see gas prices come down as we get bygoing into the winterI mean, excuse me, into next year, in 2022. I don't see anything that's going to happen in the meantime that's going to significantly reduce gas prices.
But, for example, for natural gas to heat your homes as winter is coming, there's a lotwhat people don't realize: We put in billions of dollars in what they call LIHEAP. LIHEAP is the provision whereby you're able to get funding from the Federal Government based upon your need to heat your home, and it is subsidized in a significant way. And there's billions of dollars we have passed in the legislation I got passed in March of this year, because we anticipated that would be a problem as well.
But the answer ultimately is""ultimately"" meaning the next 3 or 4 yearsis investing in renewable energy. What I was able to dono, Iand, by the way, I reallyI'm notI'm not beingI mean, I'm being literal when I say this: What I was able to do when I ranand you remember, Anderson, because I was on your show a couple times, and the issue was whether or not I could ever get the labor unions to support my environmental programs.
And I went out, and I went to the IBEW and, as well, to the autoworkers, and I laid out my plan. They fully embraced it. Why? Becauseand I spent time at General Motors and other companies, and I got General MotorsI didn't get themGeneral Motors decided, after a long time spent talking to methey were suing California because they had a higher standardmileage standard.
Mr. Cooper. Right.
The President. They dropped the suit and agreed that they would be 50-percent electric vehicles by 2030by 2030. And now you have all threeall three major manufacturerssaying the same thing.
So what will happen is, you're going to see a dramatic dropa dramatic drop in what's going to happen in terms of gas prices as we go into the next 2 or 3 years. Even if we're not able to break the monopoly pricethey're keeping it up becauseanyway.
So there'stherebut I don'tI must tell you, I don't have a near-term answer. There's two things I could do: I could go in the petroleum reserve and take out and probably reduce the price of gas maybe 18 cents or so a gallon. It's still going to be above 3 bucks.
And one of the things that I refuse to have happen, because I didn't want anybodyI made a commitment: If you pass the stuff I'm talking about, notnot one single penny in tax would go against anybody making less than 400 grand.
And so, if you notice, this isthese highway bills are not paid for by gas tax. They're paid for by direct expenditures in other areas. So the average person doesn't have to pay more.
But it's going to be hard. It's going to be hard. There's a possibility to be able to bring it down. Depends onlittle bit on Saudi Arabia and a few other things that are in the offing.
Mr. Cooper. Let me take a quick break. We'll have more from President Joe Biden.
[There was a commercial break.]
Mr. Cooper. And welcome back to our CNN town hall with President Joe Biden. Got a lot more questions to get to.
I want to introduce Neijma Donner, a professor and social worker at the University of Maryland, Baltimore. She's an independent and mother of two young boys. We're going to be talking about COVID.
Neijma, what's your question?
Coronavirus Vaccines for Young Children/National Vaccination Efforts 
Q. Thank you for taking my question, President. When will the vaccines for young children be ready? And how accessible will they be once released?
The President. I believeand I want to make it clear: Unlike past administrations, science will dictate this. I'm not telling anyone at NIH[applause]. No, I really mean it.
But I do ask my COVID team what the expectations are. The expectations are, it will be ready in the near termmeaning weeks, notnot months and months. Okay? That's number one.
Number two, there are over 800,000 sites right now that exist in America where you can go get a vaccine. And you're going to be able to do that with your children, particularlywe're going to try to work it out to deal with childcare centersmake it available thereas well as your pediatricians and theyou know, and the docsand finding places where you can do it. Some places are talking about doing atyou know, in churches on the weekend and that kind of thing.
So there'll be plenty of places to be able to get the vaccine whenif and when it is approved.
And it's likely to be approved. I spent a lot of time with the team on these things. And it's likely to be approved and whatwhether it's Moderna or whether it's Pfizer or whether it's J&J, it's going to be approved. And it will be a much smaller dose, basically the same dose, but a smaller dose. And they're doing a lot of tests on it right now.
And those of you who have children or brothers or sisters who are betweenyou know, who are in that age category above 12, get the vaccine for them. Get the vaccine. Get it now.
Mr. Cooper. Let me ask youMr. PresidentMr. President
The President. By the way, there's two famous guys in this audience here. I just noticed. [Laughter] Ben Cardinand Chris Van Hollen. And the mayor! Holy mackerel.
Mr. Cooper. Mr.
The President. This is a busman's holiday for you guys, having to come here. [Laughter] But thank you.
Coronavirus Vaccine Mandates 
Mr. Cooper. Mr. President, let me ask you a follow-up about that. As many as one in three emergency responders in some cities like Chicago, Los Angeles, right here in Baltimore, are refusing to comply with city vaccine mandates.
I'm wondering where you stand on that. Should police officers, emergency responders be mandated to get vaccines? And if not, should they bestay at home or let go?
The President. Yes and yes.
And by the way[applause]. By the way, I waited until July to talk about mandating, because I tried everything else possible. The mandates are working. All the stuff about people leaving and people gettingyou haveyou have everyone from United Airlines to Spiritall these airlines. They'rewe're not going to get all96, 97 percent of the people have gotten the vaccine.
All the talk about all these folks who are going to leave the military if they were mandatednot true. You've got about a 90-something percent vaccination rate.
I mean, so there's athe idea is thatlook, the two things that concern meone, are those who just tried to make this a political issue. ""Freedom. I have the freedom to kill you with my COVID."" [Laughter] No, I mean, come on. ""Freedom."" [Laughter] Number one.
Number twothe second one is that, you know, the gross misinformation that's out there. Like what they're saying about my buddy Colin Powelland he was my friendwho passed away. ""Colin Powell was vaccinated, and he still died."" Well, he knew he had serious underlying conditions. And it would be difficulthe clearly would have been gone earlier had he not gotten the vaccine, had he not gotten the shots.
But my generic point is: There's so much misinformation. And you know what I find fascinating? I turn on Fox to find out how popular I am. [Laughter] Well, I
Fox News/Coronavirus Vaccine Mandates 
Mr. Cooper. How are you doing there?
The President. I'm doing very well. [Laughter] I think I'm at 3 percent favorable. But[laughter].
But all kidding aside, one of the things I find: Do you realize they mandate vaccinations?
Mr. Cooper. At Fox headquarters.
The President. Yes. I find that mildly fascinating.
Mr. Cooper. You find that mildly fascinating? [Laughter]
The President. Mildly fascinating.
Mr. Cooper. I want to bring in[laughter]Thaddeus Price from[applause]. This is Thaddeus Price from Randallstown, Maryland. He's a program coordinator at Morgan State University and a Democrat.
Thaddeus, welcome.
The President's Legislative Agenda/Police Reform/Voting Rights Legislation 
Q. Good evening, Mr. President. You received overwhelming support from the Black community, and rightfully so. Rightfully so. But now many of us are disheartened
The President. Yes.
Q. as we watch a Congress fail to support police reform. We watch our voting rights vanish before our very eyes.
Mr. President, my question is: What will you do over the next 3 years to rectify these atrocities, secure our democracy, and ensure that freedoms and liberties that all Americans should be entitled to?
The President. First of all, you've stated the proposition accurately, in my view. I did get overwhelming support from the African American community. Only folks in Maryland understand Delaware is the eighth largest Black population in America, as a percent of population. It's been the source of my support. The only folks that helped me more than Black men are Black women.
And I tell you what my greatest regret is: My greatest regret is I have thesehad these three major pieces of legislation that are going to change the circumstances for working class folks and African Americans as well, that I've been busting my neck trying to pass. But what it's done is prevented me from getting deeply up to my earswhich I'm going to do once this is donein dealing with police brutality, dealing with the whole notion of: What are we going to do about voting rights? It's the greatest assault on voting rights in the history of the United Statesfor realsince the Civil War.
Q. Yes. Yes, sir.
The President. And you know, for example: When I was in the chairmanwhen I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I thought I had done something really important. And I was able to get passed and extended the Voting Rights Act for 25 years and get everyone on that committee, including the southernthe Senator from South Carolina and others, to vote for it. I thought we had moved.
The point I'm making is this: We're at a terrible place right now. And so, when this gets doneand in the meantime, here's what I've done: I have the authority to deal with Federal law enforcement.
So Federal law enforcement, I'vewe've issued mandates: no chokeholds, number one; make sure that we're going to be able to dohave no no-knock warrants; in a position where we're going to be able to see to it that we are able to go look atand we're doing it in four cities right nowpatterns of abuse and patterns of misconduct of police departments; making sure that we have access to police records, in terms of what's happening inso there's a lot I've been able to do by Executive order, in essence.
Use of the Filibuster in the Senate/Talking Requirement for the Filibuster/Public Debt Limit 
Mr. Cooper. Let me ask you, on voting rights: If it is as important to you as you say, I think there's a lot of Democrats who look at the filibuster and would like to see it changed, even if it was just on this one case. Why do you oppose that?
The President. By the way, I think they make a very good point.
Here's the deal: If in fact I get myself into, at this moment, the debate on the filibuster, I lose threeat least three votes right now to get what I have to get done on the economic side of the equationthe foreign policy side of the equation.
So what I have saidyou're shaking your head no, but let me tell you something, Jack: It's the truth. [Laughter] Number one.
Number two. Number two, what I have proposed in the meantime isit used to be the filibuster. The way it workedand we have 10 times as manymore than thattimes the filibuster has been used since 1978. It used to be you had to stand on the floor and exhaust everything you had, and youwhenand when you gave up the floor and someone else sought the floor, they had to talk until they finished. You're only allowed to do it a second time. After that, it's over; you votesomebody moves for the vote. I propose we bring that back now, immediately.
But I also think we're going to have to move to the point where we fundamentally alter the filibuster. The idea that, for example, my Republican friends say that we're going to default on the national debt because they're going to filibuster that and we need 10 Republicans to support us is the most bizarre thing I ever heard.
I think you're going to see anif theygets pulled again, I think you'll see an awful lot of Democrats being ready to say: ""Not me. I'm not doing that again. We're going to end the filibuster.""
But it still is difficult to end the filibuster, beyond that. That's another issue. But
Use of the Filibuster in the Senate/Public Debt Limit 
Mr. Cooper. But are you saying once you get this current agenda passed on spending and social programs that you would be open to fundamentally altering the filibuster or
The President. I am open to
Mr. Cooper. doing away with it?
The President. fundamentally altering
Mr. Cooper. Or doing away with it?
The President. Well, that remains to be seen, exactly what that means, in terms of ""fundamentally altering"" it, whether or not we just end the filibuster straight up.
There are certain things that are just sacred rights. One's a sacred obligation that we never are going to renege on a debt. We're the only nation in the worldwe have never, ever reneged on a single debt.
Voting Rights Legislation 
Mr. Cooper. But when it comes to voting rights, do you
The President. Voting rights is equally as consequential.
Mr. Cooper. When it comes to voting rightsjust so I'm clear, thoughyou would entertain the notion of doing away with the filibuster on that one issue? Is that correct?
The President. And maybe more.
Mr. Cooper. And maybe other issues?
Okay, let'sjust a short time ago, the full House voted to holdto hold former Trump ally, Steve Bannoncurrent Trump ally as well[laughter]in criminal contempt of Congress.
House Select Committee To Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol/Independence of the Department of Justice 
A week ago, you said the Department of Justice should prosecute those who defied subpoenas from the January 6 committee. Was that appropriate for you to weigh in on?
The President. No, the way I said it was not appropriate. I saidthey asked me would Ido I think that hethey should be prosecuted for denying thefor not showing up at the committee. And I said, ""Yes.""
Now thatwhen I've made a commitmenttheone of the things I was committed to do when I ran was reestablish the reputation and integrity of the Justice Department. It has become the mostit was corrupted under the last administration.
I should have chosen my words more wisely. I did not, have not, and will not pick up the phone and call the Attorney General and tell him what he should or should not do in terms of who he should prosecute.
But I answered the question honestly. And I think that aanyone who does not respond to that kind ofquestion from thefrom thea legitimate committee in the House of Representatives or the United States Senate should be held accountable.
So that's as much as I can say without coming and looking like I'm telling theI have yet to talk to the Attorney General about anything
Mr. Cooper. The Attorney General put out a statement saying that they would make the decision on their own.
The President. And they will.
Mr. Cooper. Yes.
The President. I guarantee that.
Executive Privilege/House Select Committee To Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol 
Mr. Cooper. You've decided not to exert executive privilege to shield the former President in the House's investigation into January 6. Why? What were you
The President. Well, again, I'm leaving that to them to tell me whatand I didn'tit's not a blanket ""I will not release the information."" It's, I'm asking them to take a look at what is legitimatewhat would legitimately fall in the position that future Presidents' authority would be compromised by that, and what is. I don't think there's much legitimacy in the claim.
So that's being looked at right now.
Mr. Cooper. We're going to take another quick break. We'll have more with President Joe Biden.
[There was a commercial break.]
Mr. Cooper. And welcome back to our CNN town hall with President Joe Biden. We're taking questions from the audience on a range of topics.
I want to bring in Megan Crawford from Towson, Maryland. She's a law student at the University of Baltimore and a Republican.
Megan, welcome.
Immigration Policy/Unaccompanied Minors at the Southern U.S. Border Addressing the Root Causes of Migration 
Q. Throughout your campaign, you've criticized former President Trump for his treatment of illegal immigrants and the southern border. Given that it's nearly been a year into your campaign, why haven't you been to the southern border of our country? And why did your stance on allowing immigrants suddenly revert to Trump-era policies?
The President. Well, they're legitimate questions. Number one, the ""remain in Mexico"" policy, which I oppose, the Court said I had to maintain it. So we're repealing it. That's one of the reasons why we haven't changed it.
We have made a gigantic changethere were over 5,000 childrenchildrenin the custody of the Border Patrol. There are now 504. We are making more progress than you think.
And we have a circumstance where one of the things that is going to bear fruit, I believe, is: I put together a program when I was a Senator, and the Vice President is helpinghelping initiate it now, where we provide for funding to change the circumstances on the ground in the countries in Central America.
For example, you're in a circumstance where, you know, people don't just sit around theirtheir hand-hewn table and say: ""I've got a great idea: Let's sell everything we have, give it to coyote, let them take us across the border, drop us in a deserta place they don't want us. Won't that be fun?""
People do it because they're desperate. They're desperate. And what I've been trying to doand I'm trying to do in this legislation, as wellis get funding so we have funding for immigration officers to be able to hear cases immediately of whether or not they justify having asylum granted to them.
Coronavirus Pandemic Impact on Immigration Policy/Unaccompanied Minors at the Southern U.S. Border/U.S. Provision of Coronavirus Vaccines 
Mr. Cooper. Mr. President
The President. We don't have that.
Mr. Cooper. You have kept in place, under a public health authority known as title 42
The President. Yes.
Mr. Cooper. which is a Trump-era policy, which allows immediate or very quick return to people who crossed over the border based on COVID protocols.
The President. Yes. And that iswe've maintained that because of the extent of theof thecontinued extent of COVID in those countries from which people are coming. It's very, very high. And so we've maintained the policy.
We are not sending back children. We send back adults, and we send backlarge families. But we don't send back children in that circumstance.
And so that's why I have a proposal to provide for over a billion doses of COVID vaccine to the rest of the world, including a significant portion to Latin and Central America.
Mr. Cooper. Do you have plans to visit the southern border?
The President's Travel Schedule/U.S. Border Policy 
The President. I've been there before, and I haven'tI mean, I know it well. I guess I should go down. But the whole point of it is: I haven't had a whole hell of lot of time to get down. I've been spending time going around looking at the $900 billion worth of damage done by hurricanes and floods and weather and traveling around the world.
But I plan onnow, my wife, Jill, has been down. She's been on both sides of the river. She's seen the circumstances there. She's looked into those places. You notice you're not seeing a lot of pictures of kids lying on top of one another withyou know, with, you know, looks like tarps on top of them.
We've been able to deal thatwe've been able to significantly increase funding through the HHSHealth and Human Servicesto provide shelter for these kids and people. But there's much more to be done.
And I realizeIthink it isit's the thing that concerns me the most about being able to get control of it. Because I've got to, number one, get enough funding to provide for immediate determination of whether or not someone that is, in fact, legitimately claiming a right to stay in the country because of legitimate fears. And if it's purely for economic reasons to get in line, but not get in the country.
So what we're doing is bringing a lot of folks who are coming in, and they're doing ankle bracelets instead of people being sent back, depending on whether or not their claim appears to be legitimate.
Police Reform Efforts in Minneapolis, Minnesota/Law Enforcement Best Practices/Community-Oriented Policing Practices 
Mr. Cooper. Let me ask you about two other issues in the news. In less than 2 weeks, Minneapolis voters are going to decide whether or not to replace the police department in Minneapolis with what they would call a ""Public Safety Department."" What do you think of that?
The President. Well, it depends what they mean by that. Look, Igrew up in a neighborhood
Mr. Cooper. They said the Public Safety Department would behave a more comprehensive public health approach to the delivery of functions of public safety and could include licensed peace officers, police officers.
The President. Well, could. I think you need police officers. I think we need police officers to protect us. I think they have to be under certain changed circumstances. But I think we have to provide for them more opportunityI call for more money for police to go to community policing, as well as dealing with additional help for psychologists and others working with police departments.
Mr. Cooper. You've never been a fan of defunding police.
The President. No, I haven't. I've never supported. But I've been a fanof controlling police and making sure they're held accountable. That's athey're two different issues.
And one of the thingslook, when we had community policing, initially in the late nineties, violent crime dropped significantlysignificantly. And the reason it did is because we had significant number of police. What I did: I eliminated the LEAA fundingLaw Enforcement Assistance Actand I put in place the proposal that required community policing.
What that meant was: If you were allit's going to take a second, but it's important. [Laughter] If yourwhat that meant, if your city had authorized a police force of 100 people, you could not take the money for community policing and fire 50 people and rehire 50 so now I just had the Federal Government paying for half and you didn't increase the number of police.
You had to increase the number of police beyond yourwhatever. So I remember my son Beau was the chief law enforcement officer of the State of Delaware as attorney general of the State of Delaware. And he used to do what I did.
He'd go down the east side where you can find the best basketball in the city. You know, every town has those places. And he'd sit there on the bench with my sonmy grandson Hunter, who's now 16, who was then 5, sitting the bench, and he'd get to know these guys.
And he'd walk over and he'd knock on the window of the police car that was sitting therethe cop not getting out of the carand say, ""Get the hell out of the car and meet these folks."" ""No.""
I'll give you one example: What we required initially was every policeevery community policemanthere were two assignedthey were assigned in groups of twothey had to know the neighborhood.
I remember getting a call, as youyou've been to Delaware; you go down that road as you're heading down to the train station, Martin Luther King Boulevard. There was a woman who lived in one of those apartments in the second floor that sort of had an outcroppingsa Victorian kind ofit was a two-story place.
And whatbut the cops made sure they hadshe had their phone number. So, when a drug deal was going down, she'd pick up the phone on call and say to that police officer with a cell phone that the drug deal is going down, knowing that she would never be fingered, knowing that she would never be the one told it happened. And so crime began to drop.
They had to know who owned the local liquor store. They had to know and walk in and shake hands with the local minister. They had to knowthat's community policing.
Mr. Cooper. Let me try to get in a couple other questions
The President. I'm sorry.
Mr. Cooper. from our audience.
The President. Ask easy ones.
Status of Public Monuments, Memorials, and Statues 
Mr. Cooper. But before we do, just another quick news question: New York City is removing a statue of Thomas Jefferson from its legislative chamber because of Jefferson's history as a slave holder. Do you support that decision?
The President. Well, I think that's up to the locality to decide what they want to do on that. Look, there'sthere's a lot ofthere's a lot of people who have no social redeeming value, historically. And there's others who have made serious mistakes in theyin terms of whatwhat exists now in terms of what we should be talking about, but have done an awful lot.
And so the very thingfor example, I just spoke at the Martin Luther King dedication. And I pointed out that we're right across from the Lincoln Memorial. Well, you know, andand you talked aboutand then the Jefferson Memorial. And whatwhat are we doing? I talked about how they said: ""We're unique in all the world, as a nation. We're the only nation founded on an idea. We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men and women are created equal, endowed by""no nation has ever been founded on an idea. Have we ever lived up to it? No.
Mr. Cooper. Let me bring
The President. But it's a pretty big idea that somebody wrote that down and got the rest of the country to agree to it. So it depends. It depends. And it's
Mr. Cooper. Let me bringlet me bring in Glenn Niblo, a student at Loyola University, originally from Connecticut. He's a Republican. Glenn, welcome.
Q. Hi.
The President. Where in Connecticut are you from?
Q. Greenwich.
The President. That's great.
China-U.S. Relations/Taiwan 
Q. China just tested a hypersonic missile. What will you do to keep up with them militarily? And can you vow to protect Taiwan?
The President. Yes and yes. We aremilitarily, China, Russia, and the rest of the world knows we have the most powerful military in the history of the world. Don't worry about whether we're going tothey're going to be more powerful. What you do have to worry about is whether or not they're going to engage in activities that will put them in a position where therethey may make a serious mistake.
And so I have hadI have spoken and spent more time with Xi Jinping than any other world leader has. That's why you haveyou know, you hear people saying, ""Biden wants to start a new cold war with China."" I don't want a cold war with China. I just want to make China understand that we are not going to step back. We are not going to change any of our views.
Mr. Cooper. So are you saying that the United States would come to Taiwan's defense if
The President. Yes.
Mr. Cooper. China attacked?
The President. Yes, we have a commitment to do that.
Mr. Cooper. All right. We're going towe're going to take another quick break. We got more questions from the audience. We'll be right back.
[There was a commercial break.]
Death of Former Secretary of State General Colin L. Powell 
Mr. Cooper. And welcome back. We are live with President Joe Biden, here in the city of Baltimore.
Just in the few minutes we have left: The country lostand I know you lost somebody who you considered close friend, General Colin Powell. What's something about him that people didn't know?
The President. He had enormous integrity; they knew that. But he's one of the few serious, serious players I've dealt with over these years who, when he made a mistake, he acknowledges it. He said, ""I acknowledgeI was wrong about it.""
Mr. Cooper. That's rare these days.
The President. No, it's rare. It's been rareit's rare in human nature for someone in a powerful position to say they are wrong. They are wrong. ""I made a mistake."" That's a hard thing to do. And I've had to do it about a half a dozen times lately. [Laughter] But all kidding asideand the second thing about him was he had a lot of serioushe had real compassion. You know, hiswell, I'll tell you afterwards, butbecause we only have a few minutes.
He and I went out to the Secret Service racetrack. He had a brandnew Corvette his family boughthis kids bought him. And I have a '67 327/350, and we raced. We raced. [Laughter]
And you knowyou know, the only reasonno, I'm serious. It was on Jay Leno. Check it out. Jay Leno live. He'she's a hell of a guy.
Mr. Cooper. Who won?
The President. Well, I won only because he was worried I was going to crash into him. [Laughter] Because I don't have positraction, so I was burning rubber the whole way out there, and I could see him going, ""Whoa."" [Laughter]
Mr. Cooper. All right. So justmy final question is: You famouslyat the signing ceremony, I think it was, for Obamacare, you famously leaned in to the then-President, andI'm not going to say a direct quote, but[Laughter]off-mike, you said, ""This is a big effing deal."" [Laughter]
And I'm wondering: The Build Back Better planis it a bigger effing deal than that? [Laughter]
The President. Sixty seconds. We got in the car to go over to thethe Department of Education after we did that.
Mr. Cooper. Oh, I thought you were talking about drag racing still. [Laughter]
The President. No, no. He got in the car, and he was laughing like hell. I said, ""What's so damn funny?"" And he told me.
I whispered in his earthis way. I looked to see where it was. I said, ""I'm going toand this is a big deal."" And I didn't realize the guy behind me was really lipreading. You can see it. [Laughter] No, I'm serious.
The answer is: Yes, this is bigger. No, it is bigger becausenotnot because what he did wasn't enormous. He broke the ice. Enormous.
But part of what I have in here is, we also increased access to the Affordable Care Act, and we reduced the price an average of 60 bucks a month for anyone who's in the Affordable Care Act. Plus, on top of that, we have another 300 billion dollars' worth of health care everin it.
So it'sI would say this is a bigger darn deal.
Mr. Cooper. Mr. President, thank you very much. Appreciate your time.
The President. Thank you very much.

The President. Thank you, Kamala. Thank you all so very much. Mr. President[laughter]Harry, thank you for your stewardship.
You know, here in the heart of the Capital of the United States of America, the tensions and the heart of the Nation are vividly on display. Dr. King stands determined and brave, looking out over the promised land.
Across the Tidal Basin stands another giant of our history: Thomas Jefferson, whose words declared the very idea of America that we are all ""created equal . . . endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights,"" and we all deserve to be treated equally throughout our lives.
To state the obviousand no audience knows it better than this onewe've never fully lived up to that idea. But we've never walked away from it fully. We've never walked away. In his sermon to the March on Washington, Dr. King called on all of America to live up to the full meaning and promise of our Declaration of Independence.
And so they stand here in perpetuity, in timely and timeless conversation that inspires us and challenges us. It reminds us of how far we've come, where we need to go, and how far and how much longer the journey is. And it's a conversation that shapes our days and that we must carry forward.
Madam Vice President, Madam Speaker, Chair of the Black Caucus Beatty, Congressional Black Caucus members, the Memorial Foundation, leaders of faith and community, distinguished guests: From here, we see the ongoing push and pull between progress and struggle over the self-evident truths of our democracy. And in our Nation, we now face an inflection point in the battle, literally, for the soul of America. And it's up to us, together, to choose who we want to be and what we want to be.
I know the progress does not come fast enough. It never has. And the process of governing is frustrating and sometimes dispiriting. But I also know what's possible if we keep the pressure up, if we never give up, if we keep the faith.
We're at an inflection pointas I know I've maybe overused that phrase, but it is an inflection point in American historyin delivering on economic justice. For it was the dignity of work that Dr. King was in Memphis on that fateful day in April, helping sanitation workers, not only for better pay and safer conditions, but to be granted more dignity as human beings.
In our time, it's about recognizing that for much too long we've allowed a narrowed and cramped view of the promise of America, a view that America is a zero-sum game, particularly of the recent past. ""If you succeed, I fail."" ""If you get ahead, I fall behind."" And maybe worst of all, ""If I can hold you down, I lift myself up."" Instead of what it should beand it's just self-evident""If you do well, we all do well."" That's keeping the promise of America. I've never seen a time when working folks did well that the wealthy didn't do very well.
Look, it's the core of our administration's economic vision, and it's a fundamental paradigm shift for this Nation. For the first time in a couple generations, we're going to be investing in working families, putting them first and helping them get ahead, rather than the wealthy and the biggest and most powerful people out there.
We're investing in Black families with rescue checks and tax cuts that will reduce Black poverty by 34 percentBlack child poverty by more than 50 percentthis year. And we're aggressivelywith the leadership with of the people I'm looking at right nowcombating housing discrimination to create a generation of wealth. How did every other person make it to the middle class from a working-class circumstance? Just like my dad did, build equity in a housegranted, it was small; granted, it wasn't much, but it was enough to build a little equity.
We'll use the Federal Government's purchasing power to unlock billions of dollars in new opportunities of minority-owned small businesses and access to Government contracts. Is there any doubt that providing more people with just a little more breathing room to take care of their families, generate a little bit of wealth that they can pass on to their children, and create jobs in their communities would uplift the entire countryall the country? Everyone.
And as the economy recovers, we are determined and focused on rebuilding it over the long run. No one should have to hold their breath as they cross a rundown bridge to determine whether it's safe enough or a dangerous intersection in their hometown.
A nationevery American, every child should be able to turn on a faucet and drink water that's not contaminated by lead or anything else.
As a nation, everyone should have access to affordable high-speed internet. Gone the days when you have to pull up to a McDonald's and sit in a parking lot with your child to do their homework when there's virtual learning going on.
Dr. King said, ""Of all the forms of inequity, injustice in health care is the most shocking and most inhumane."" This is a once-in-a-century pandemic that's hit this country hard and especially the African American community.
It's likely you've all lost someone to the virus or know someone who has lost a loved one. One in six hundred Black Americans have died from COVID-19. It's been reported that Black children are more than twice as likely as white children to have lost a parent or a caregiver to COVID-19, to have to experience the trauma and loss.
Many of my colleagues in the Congress are working onwhat we have to now work on even more ferventlyand that is mental health care, helping people through the difficult periods we have. It's been devastating, but we can find purpose in pain. We can find purpose in this pain.
Equity is the center of my administration's COVID-19 response. The vaccination rates among Black adults is now essentially on par with White adults. In the midst of this pandemic, we're building on the Affordable Care Act to extend coverage to lower health care costs for millions of Black families.
We're also working on lowering prescription drug costs by giving Medicare the power to negotiate lower prices. And how do you know the plan will work? Because the drug companies are spending millions of bucks to try to stop it. [Laughter] That's how you know. Together, we're making health care a right, not a privilege, in this Nation.
And for the millionsthe millions of youwho feel financially squeezed in raising a child while caring for an aging parent, the so-called sandwich generation, we want to make eldercare affordable and accessible so your aging loved ones can live with greater independence and dignity.
We also want to make sure childcare costs for most families are cut at least in half. No working familyif we get what you all are helping me get doneno working family in America will pay more than 7 percent of their income on childcare for any child under 5.
We want to give raises to millions of care workers and home workers so they can increase their capacity, increase their knowledge, increase their opportunities. Health workers and childcare workers are disproportionately womenwomen of color and immigrantsworkers, like the ones Dr. King stood for when he marched and gave his life.
Look, folks, just imagine, instead of consigning millions of our children to underresourced schools, we gave every single child in America access to an education at age 3 and age 4, quality preschool. We can afford to do this. We can't afford not to do it.
And we do know, no matter what the background or circumstance a child comes from, when given that opportunity, they have a better than 58-percent chance of making it all the way through 12 years without getting themselves in trouble and maybe going beyond that.
This will change lives forever. So will historic investments in higher education: significantly increasing Pell grants to help millions of Black students in lower income families attend community colleges and 4-year schools.
I tell you, let me be clear: In the shadow of the Morehouse menI hear a lot about that, guys[laughter]and with a Howard alumna[laughter]I keep making the case""if you'd excuse the point of personal privilege,"" as we used to say in the Senatethe best HBCU in the country is Delaware State. [Laughter] That's where I got started. Come on.
But here's what we've donein addition to putting the president of Delaware State, who used to work for meDoctorhein charge of all of thiswe're committed to nearly $5 billion this year in historic investments, with more, in Historically Black Colleges and Universities to make every single studentgive them a shot with good-paying jobs.
And you all know what I mean, but for anybody watching this: One of the problems is, Black students in colleges just have every single capability any other student does, but guess what? Because they don't have great endowments, they can't compete for those Government contracts that are out there that the big schools are able to go out and get. Cybersecurity, for example, starting salary is 100-, 125,000 bucks. But you don't get to get that contract unless you have laboratories, unless you have the facilities you can, in fact, train on.
We also know this about the promise of America. Economic injustice also means delivering environmental justice to communities onfenceline communities, dividing homes in toxic areas. My State has one of the highest cancer rates in the history of Americain America. Because I lived in a fenceline community called Claymont, Delaware. We used to get up in the morningnot a jokeand I'd get driven to the little school I went, up the street; turn on the windshield wiper in the fall, the first frost, and literally, there'd be an oil slick on the window. Not a joke. An oil slick on the window. It's why an awful lot of us, including me, have bronchial asthma.
It means reducing pollution so our children can develop and avoid these consequences. Every one of you have an alley in your State; we call it ""Cancer Alley"" in our State, going down Route 13.
Look, it means building up our resilience to the climate crisis or the next extreme weather events. And these have been of biblical proportionsbiblical proportions. A-hundred-seventy-eight-mile top winds in a hurricane down in Louisiana. More people dying in Queens, in their basements, because 20 inches of rainthey flooded and couldn't get out of their basements; they drowned. Superstorms, droughts, wildfire, hurricanes.
This is the promise for America: urban and rural and all across America, not just for any one area. And as we fight for economic justice to fulfill the promise of America for all Americans, the work continues on delivering equal justice under the law.
Look, I know the frustration we all feel that more than 1 year after George Floyd's murder and the conviction of his murderer about 6 months ago, meaningful police reform in George's name has not passed Congress. I remember many times meeting with his little daughter. And she'd say to me: ""My daddy is changing history. He's going to change history."" But we haven't fulfilled that yet.
I understand. We've got to keep fighting. But let me be clear though: We're going to continue to fight for real police reform legislation, and the fight is not anywhere near over.
Despite Republican obstruction, my administration is acting. We've already announced changes to the Federal law enforcement policies: a ban on choke holds, restriction on no-knock warrants, requirements that Federal agents wear and activate body cameras, ending Department of Justice use of private prisons, rescinding the previous administration's guidance to U.S. attorneys to require the harshest of penalties.
The Justice Department has opened a pattern-or-practice investigation of systematic police misconduct in police departments in Phoenix, Louisville, and Minneapolis. Just because we can't get it done in the States, we are not standing back. And we have much more to do.
In addition to these important steps, my administration also wants to advance some meaningful police reform that includes additional Executive actions to live up to America's promise of equal justice under the law.
Our work continues to create safer and stronger communities in critical ways. With my American Rescue Planand thank you in the Congress for supporting iteverybody kind of forgets that was $1.9 billiontrillion dollars. We've got a hell ofheck of a lot done with that. [Laughter] Thatit did so well, people don't even know where it came from. [Laughter] No, I'm serious. Think about it.
Like, ""What did you do for me lately?"" Well, we had $1.9 billion [trillion]* we took care of.
Vice President Harris. Trillion! Trillion!
The President. Well, we made historic investments in community policing and violence intervention programs and were shown to reducesome of these programs reduce violence by 60 percent.
We're expanding summer programs and job opportunities and service and support to keep young people safe and out of trouble.
We're helping formerly incarcerated people successfully reenter their communities. In the past, you'd get 25 bucks and a bus ticket. And you'd go back right under the bridge you just were there before. You should have access to Pell grants. You should have access to thehousing. You should have access to all the things. You paid your price. And we shouldn't put back in the spot where you have no options.
We're also working to stem the flow of firearms from rogue gun dealers to curb the epidemic of gun violence. I know I get criticized for being the guy who passed the assault weapons ban. I'm proud of having passed the assault weapons ban.
But here's the deal: We heard Dr. King paraphrase Micah. He said, ""Give us the ballot, and we will place judges on the benches of the South who will do justly and love mercy."" Well, in just 9 months, we have appointed more Black women to the Federal circuit courts and more former public defenders to the bench than any administration in all of American historybecause of you. We're going to change it.
And we did it in record time, and we're just getting started, because of all of you in the audience here. You've been the engine behind all of this.
But we also know this: To make real the full promise of America, we have to protect that fundamental right: the right to votethe sacred right to vote. You know, it's democracy's threshold of liberty. With it, anything is possible. Without it, nothing is.
Today, the right to vote and the rule of law are under unrelenting assault from Republican Governors, attorneys general, secretaries of State, State legislators. And they're following my predecessorthe last Presidentinto a deep, deep black hole and abyss.
No, I really mean it. Think about it. That's what got me involved in civil rights as a kid, when I was 26 years old. It gave meI had never plannedI love reading about how ""Biden knew he was going to run President."" Hell, I didn't know I was even going to be able to run for the county council; I didn't even want to. [Laughter]
But look, this struggle is no longer just over who gets to vote or making it easier for eligible people to vote. It's about who gets to count the voteswhether they should count at all. Jim Crow in the 21st century is now a sinister combination of voter suppression and elective subversionelection subversion.
My fellow Americans, I thought, at one point, that I had been able to do something good as chairman of the Judiciary Committee. I was able to get every member of the committee, including some of the most conservative Members that ever servedclearly who had racist backgroundsto vote to extend the Voting Rights Act for 25 years. I thought, ""Whoa."" One of the proudest things I ever did as a Senator.
But guess what? This means that some State legislatures want to make it harder for you to vote. And if you do vote, they want to be able to tell you whether or not your vote counts. That's not happened before.
They want the ability to reject the final vote and ignore the will of the people if their preferred candidateBlack or White or Asian or Latino, doesn't matterif thatif their candidate doesn't win. And they're targeting not just voters of color, as I said, but every voter who doesn't vote the way they want.
I have to admit to you, having been as Senator in my whole of 36-year career involved inI worked with a lot of folks out here on civil rights issuesI thought, ""Man, you can't turn this back."" I'd bet you could defeat hate. What if we could actually defeat hate?
But the most un-American thing that any of us can imaginethe most undemocratic and the most unpatriotic, and yet sadly, not unprecedentedtime and again, we've witnessed threats to the right to vote in free and fair elections come to fruition. Each time, we fought back. And we've got to continue to fight back today.
I want to thank Martin Luther King III for leading marches on voting rights during the anniversary of the March on Washington on August 28.
The Vice President and I, and our colleagues here, have spent our careers doing this work. It's central to our administration.
On the anniversary of Bloody Sunday, I directed each and every Federal agency to promote access to voting from each agency heeding that call. For example, the Department of Veterans Affairs, I asked them to make it easier for veterans and their families to register and to vote at VA facilities so it'd be open. In addition, the U.S. Department of Justice has doubled the voting rights enforcement staff.
We've got a long way to go though. It's using authorities to challenge the onslaught of State laws undermining voting rights, whether in old or new ways.
To something like 20 percent of theor half the Republicansthe registered Republicans: I am not your President; Donald Trump is still your President. As we Catholics say, ""Oh, my God."" [Laughter]
But look, the focus is going to remain on discrimination and racial discriminatory lawsGeorgia's various [vicious]* new antivoting laws. And let's be clear about GeorgiaDr. King's home State and the home State of someone who has literally stood in his shoes as
[At this point, a jet could be heard flying overhead.]
I think some of you guys knew this wasthe next line was coming; that's why you had the jets come out[laughter]stood in his shoes as a Morehouse man. [Laughter] That's what I keep getting from Cedric. Oh, anyway. [Laughter] And as a preacher in the pulpit of EbenezerUnited States Senator Raphael Warnock, the first Black Senator in Georgia's history.
Senator Warnock won his election in the battle of ideas. He earned the trust and confidence of a broad coalition of voters in Georgia. And the response of Republicans in Georgia, what was it? It's not to try winning on the merits and ideas, it's by changing the rules to make it harder for people to vote, deny the franchise.
The Vice President has been leading our administration's efforts. And we've supported Democrats pressing to enact critical voting rights bills since day one of this administration, making sure we have unanimous support. But each and every time, the Senate Republicans block it by refusing even to talk about it. They're afraid to even just debate the bills in the U.S. Senate, as they did again yesterday, even on a bill that includes provisions that they've traditionally supported. It's unfair, it's unconscionable, and it's un-American.
And this battle is far from over. The door has not been closed. The John Lewis Voting Rights Act will soon come up for a votenamed after our dear friend we still miss dearly, but whose voice we hear every day in our hearts and in our conscience.
It's a law that helped lead the reauthorizationas I said, for 25 years that I served of thein the Senate Judiciary Committeeexpanding the Voting Rights Act. It's traditionally received bipartisan support. We have to keep up the fight and get it done. And I know the moment we're in; you know the moment we are in. I know the stakes; you know the stakes. This is far from over.
And finally, we're confronting the stains of what remainsthe deep stain on the soul of the nation: hate and White supremacy. You know, there's a through line of subjugation and enslaved people from our earliest days to the reigns of radicalized terror of the KKK to Dr. King being assassinated. And through thatand though that line continues to be the torches emerging from dark shadows in Charlottesville, carrying out Nazi banners and chanting anti-Semitic bile, and Ku Klux Klan flags; and the violent, deadly insurrection on the Capitol 9 months agoit was about White supremacy, in my view.
The rise of hate crimes against Asian Americans during the pandemic and the rise of anti-Semitism here in America and around the world.
The through line is that hate never goes away. It neverI thoughtin all of the years I've been involved, I thought once we got through it, it would go away. But it doesn't; it only hides. It only hides until some seeming-legitimate person breathes some oxygen under the rocks where they're hiding and gives it some breath.
I've said it beforeand all my colleagues here know itaccording to the United States intelligence community, domestic terrorism from White supremacists is the most lethal terrorist threat in the homeland. To that end, our administration is carrying out the first-ever comprehensive effort to tackle the threatpassed by domesticposed by domestic terrorism, including White supremacy.
We are doing so by taking action to reduce online radicalism and recruitment to violence. We're also disrupting networks that inspire violence and domestic terrorists by providing resources to communities to build resilience. We cannot and must not give hate any safe harborany safe harbor.
My fellow Americans, standing here I'm reminded of the goal of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which Dr. King led. And I quotehe said his goal was to, quote, ""redeem the soul of America."" That's what's at stake here: the soul of America.
And we know that it's not the work of a single day or a single administration or even a single generation. But here we stand with Dr. King to show: Out of struggle there is progress; out of despair there is hope. From the promise of equality and opportunity, of jobs, justice, and freedom, we see Black excellence, American excellence, Black history as American history and a defining source of the might of this Nation.
That's why we're here to today: to renew our own courage in the shadow, in the light, and on the shoulders of Dr. King, Coretta Scott King, and all those known and unknown who gave their whole souls to this work.
The courage to confront wrong and to try do right. The courage to heal the broken places in the nation. The courage to see America whole, to acknowledge where we fall short, to devote ourselves to the perfection of the Union that we love and we must protect.
For if we can summon the courage to do these things, we'll have done our duty, honored our commitments, and brought the dream of Dr. King just a little bit closer to reality. It's the highest of callings. It's the most sacred of charges. And it's what, with the help of God, we can do now.
So let's go forth from this sacred placeof tumult and turmoilwith the hope and promise of a nation always seeking, always thriving, always keeping the faith. Because, folksyou know, I know my colleagues in the Senate used to always kid me for quoting Irish poets on the floor. They thought I did it because I was Irish. It's not the reason; they're the just the best poets in the world. [Laughter] There's a line from theand I believe this to be true. There's a line from a poem, ""The Cure at Troy""and it says that ""once in a lifetime that tidal wave of justice rises up, and hope and history rhyme."" That's not the whole quote. I won't bore you with it all. But ""hope and history rhyme.""
I believe the American peoplethe vast majorityare with us. I think they see much more clearly what you've all been fighting for your whole lives now. It's in stark relief.
The bad news: We had a President who appealed to the prejudice. The good news is that he took thehe ripped the Band-Aid off, made it absolutely clear what's at stake. And I think the American people will follow us. But guess what? Whether they will or not, we have no choice. We have to continue to fight.
God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.

2021-10-20 00:00:00,"Remarks in Scranton, Pennsylvania","
The President. Hello, hello, hello. It's good to be home. Thank you all. Please, please be seated.
I just want you to know we have a tradition in the Biden-Finnegan family: When you see a relative, you go see them first. These are my relatives in the front row here, I want you to know.
And I spent an awful lot of time across from St. Paul's Church at my Uncle Jack Finnegan's house. His daughters are here. And he washe taught up at ""The U.""
And I just want you to know that Amtrak is here. They can tell you that you couldthat you should name half the line after me. [Laughter] I am most railroad guy you ever going to meet: 2,100,000 miles on Amtrak. Hear me now? Not a joke.
What happened was, when you are a President or a Vice President, they keep meticulous mileage of when you fly an Air Force aircraft. And so, aboutI guess it was 7 years in to my tenure as Vice President. And I used to always like to take Amtrak home on Friday. My momI'd try to go home and see my mom, who was living with us at the time after my dad passed, and I'd try to get home.
And the Secret Service are wonderful. They're the best in the world. They never liked me taking Amtrak because it stops too often, and too many people get on, and you don't know. Andbut I oftenthere was abut Iit turned out I was about number three in seniority on the road at the time, if you didwell, in terms of the actual time on the road.
And a lot of the folks in Amtrak became my family. Not a joke. I'd ride every day. I commuted every single day for 36 years as PresidentVice President of the United States. After my wife and daughter were killed, I went home to see my family and never stopped goingdoing that.
And so Angelo Negri was fromyou remember Ange? Ange came up to me one day when I waswhen they just had announced that I had flown 1 million somex-number of miles on Air Force aircraft. And Ange comes up, and I'm getting into the car, and he goes: ""Joey, baby. What do you""[laughter]and I thought the Secret Service was going to shoot him. [Laughter] I said: ""No, no, no, no. He's good. He's good."" It's a true story.
And he said, ""I just readbig deal. Big deal""whatever is was""1,200,000 milesAir Force. You know how many miles you did Amtrak?"" And I said, ""No, Ange. I don't have any idea, pal."" He said: ""Let me tell you. We were at the retirement dinner."" And he said: ""We added it up. You averaged a hundredI think it saystwenty-one days a year. One hundred and twenty-one days. Your 36 years, plus as Vice President. Boom, boom. You have traveled over 2 million miles, Joe. I don't want to hear any more about the Air Force."" [Laughter]
But in the Build Back Better plan, I got more money for passenger rail than the entire Amtrak system cost to begin with. We're going to change the nation in a big way.
Shane, I want to thank you for the introduction. I really do.
And Madam Mayor, Paige, you've done a great joba great, great jobno, I really mean it. I'm a big fan. And IsheIwhen I got electedthis is the God's truthafter I checked on what the margin was in the State of Delaware, I called up here. [Laughter] She had won that year too. And I found out that I won every precinct in Scranton. And I looked up and said, ""Mom, I did it."" [Laughter] ""I did it.""
Look, and it's great to be here. It's great to be here in Pennsylvania with a very close friendbecome a close friendand a great Governor, Governor Wolf. It's good to see you, Gov.
And, Matt, thank you for the passport to let me back into the district. [Laughter] And you knowyou know, weit's interesting. I grew up not very far from Bobby, whereexcuse me, the Senatorwhere he grew up is about a total ofif you add it up, I think it's about five blocks, six blocks.
And his dad and I were about 18 years apart, and we're 17 years apart, so it's like a continuum going on here. But I just want you to know: We went to the same schools, same parishjust a few years apartgive a few, take a few years.
And Scranton is where I played shortstop with the Green Ridge Little League in the first year that it was put up. My dad helped build the field down there. And spent a lot of time at Simmey's, buying penny candy, and Hanks Hoagies on Woodlawn Street, watching movies at the ""Roosie"" on the weekend. And trying to reenact all they did, andwhen you watched those movies.
I thinkand I was toldI don't know that it's trueI was the only kid in my year that I was able to walk across the ""Lacky"" on that pipe that was just above the thing. If you fell in the Lacky, you were a lackey. [Laughter] You were in trouble. Butat any rate[laughter]
Audience member. [Inaudible]
The President. That's right.
Look, no matter how long you live here in Scranton, it's a place that climbs into your heart and it never really leaves you. And that's the God's truth. You know, it's like that old saying goes, ""You can take the boy out of Scranton, but you can't take Scranton out of the boy."" There's something special about it. And I believe that home is where your character is etched, and I really mean that.
Some of you have heard me say this before. It's where your view of the world begins, and where you begin, and where it takes shape. And that happened to me in 2446 North Washington Avenue.
We used to come back after 10:30 mass at St. Paul'sSt. Clare's wasn't built till I had movedat St Paul's, and my grandfather would hold court. And back in those days, all the men had breakfast in the kitchen. My mother was one of five children and four brothers. One was lost in World War II. And a guy who was the chief political reporter at the newspaper, Tommy Phillips, who waslived on the street behind ushe was a good friend of my grandfather's.
And all the women would go into the dining room and, on the lace tablecloth, and have tea. [Laughter] And the men would, in fact, have a big breakfast. And if you were a kid, if you're a young boy, you could sort of wander around the table. You can never sit at the table. And so I used to, every once in a while, walk in and just sort of wander around. I'd stand by my grandpop, and I'd put my hand on his shoulder, and Ithey talked. And they talked about everything from sports and politics, and that's whereI learned an awful lot at that kitchen table.
I learned from my grandpop that money doesn't determine your worth. I learned, andhe told me, and it's not a jokethose of you who know, we know it to be true, and you guys know itis that, ""No one in the world is more worthy than you, Joey, but everyone is your equal; everybody is your equal."" My mom would remind me, she said, ""Joey, this is the God's truth. Remember you're defined by your courage, and you're redeemed by your loyalty."" You're defined by your courage, and you're redeemed by your loyalty.
And my dadwhen things got tough in Scranton after the war, when there wasn't any work, my dad did not work in the coal minesmy great-grandfather was a mining engineer, but my dad was in sales, and he worked for the[inaudible]trucking company. And things got slow in Scranton, so we moved.
I remember the day he cameI think the longest walk a parent can make is up a short flight of stairs to tell their kid: ""You can't live here anymore. You can't because weDad hasDad doesn't have a job""or ""Mom don't have a job."" And my dad had moved from Wilmington, Delaware, to Scranton when he was a senior in higha junior in high school. He wentthen, it was called St. Thomasnot the Prep, but it was called St. Thomas in those days.
And I remember him walking up ininto the bedroom and saying, ""Honey, I'm going toDad's going to have to move. I'm going tobut I'mit's going to probably take about a year. I'll come home every single weekend. It's only 155 miles."" I thought that was like 600 miles away. ""I'll come home every weekend."" But""And when, I get enoughwe get enough money, I'm going to bring you and Mom and everyone down to Wilmington. You're going to like it.""
And I thought that was likeand you know, an awful lot of parents who left Scranton back in those days, who moved awayhad to move away. And you know, I gained so much respect from my father as I got older because I thought about how much it wouldhow much it must have hurt him and the pride it took for him to walk into my grandfather's pantry and say: ""Ambrose, is itcan I leave Jean and the kids with you? I promise I'll make it up to you. But I'll be back every weekend. But I promise I'll make it up."" That's a hard thing for a proud man or woman to do. But so many had to do it.
And I remember when we moved down to Delaware and my dad would say, ""Joey""and all my friends know thisI mean, literally, this phraseyou've heard him say it I don't know how many times""Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay.'"" And think about it. Think about what it is: It means a lot more than just whether you get a paycheck. It defines who you are, in his mind.
And I learned that at the kitchen table in Scrantonthe place where you take care of one another. And as I said, my motherI used to stutter badly when I was a kid. If Tommy Bell and Charlie Roth and all of my old friends were here at St. Paul's, you know, Imy nickname was ""Blackbird."" It was, ""Bi-bi-bi-blackbird."" It wasn't meant as a compliment. And I wasn't very big, butyou could beat me, but I'd hurt you. [Laughter] You think I'm kidding; I'm not.
Andbut you know, it's one of those things thatI was fortunate, because the people I was surrounded byour neighbors in Scranton, as wellthat peoplepeople stuck up for youstuck up for one another. And my mother used to sayand I never quite understood it: ""Remember, Joey, look at melook at me, Joey. You're a Biden."" I'mlike I'm a DuPont or something. You know what I mean? [Laughter] I swear to God. ""You're a Biden. Nobody is better than you, and everybody is equal to you. Nobody.""
The point I'm making is: The truth is, Scranton isn't my home because of the memories it gave me; it's my home because of the values it gave me. So, when I ran for President, I came back to Scranton. I came back to Scranton. And I started here in Scranton. And I resolved to bring Scranton values to bear, to make a fundamental shift in how our economy works for working people, to build the economy from the ground up and the middle out and not from the top down. I've never known a time when the middle class has done well and the wealthy haven't done very, very well. I've never known such a time.
So I'm here today to talk about what's fundamentally at stake right now for the families and for our country. For most of the 20th century, we led the world by a significant margin because we invested in our people. We invested in ourselvesnot only in our roads and our highways and our bridges, but in our people, in our families. We didn't just build an Interstate Highway System, we built a highway to the sky, to outer space. We were alsowe invested to win the space race, and we won.
We were also among the first to provide access to free education, beginning back in the late 1800s, early 1900s. We invested in our children. Does anybody think today, if we were making that decision for the first time, we'd say, ""Twelve years is enough in the 21st century""? ""Twelve years is enough""? It's not. But back then, they did, and it's the reason why we leapt ahead of the rest of the world. Not a joke. We became among the best educated countries in the world.
But somewhere along the way, we stopped investing in ourselves. America is still the largest economy in the world. We still have the most productive workers in the world, the most innovative minds. But we risk losing our edge as a nation.
You know, our infrastructure used to be the best in the worldnot a jokethe best in the world. Today, according to the World Economic Forum, we rank 13th in the world in terms of infrastructure: our roads, bridges, highways, internet, the whole works. Thirteenth in the world.
We used to lead the world in educational achievement. Today, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in Europe ranks America 35 out of 37 major companies [countries]* when it comes to investing in early childhood education.
And talk about an equalizerthe greatest equalizer in the world. One of the great universities has done studies in the last 15 years: You give a kid, no matter what the kid's backgroundfrom a broken home, from a home where mom or dad didn't go to school or whateverand you put them in schoolthird grade, you increase by 50school, not daycareyou increase by 56 percent the chance that they'll complete 12 years of school and build confidence.
What's education all about? It's about building confidence in a child. It's about giving the tools to do something.
We can't be competitive in the 21st-century economy if we continue to slide the way we have. That's why I resolved that we have to, once again, build America from the bottom up and the middle out. Again, not the top down.
And by the way, I'm a capitalist. I think if you can be a millionaire or a billionaire, fine. Just do your fair share. Just do your fair share. You know, trickle-down economics has always failed. It hadn't built this country. You know who built this countrylike the young man who just introduced me: union people. People who, in fact, can make a decent, hard wage and build the country.
I'm notit's not hyperbole. I mean it from the bottom of my heart. That's why I proposed two critical pieces of legislation that are being debated back in Washington.
Now, there's some really smart national press with me today, and they have understandably believed that there's no possibility of my getting this done. This had been declared ""dead on arrival"" from the moment I introduced it. But I think we're going to surprise them, because I think people are beginning to figure out what's at stake.
You know, when I use the phrase ""build back better,"" it's being used internationally now. I got the G-7the largest countries in the worldto agree that we're going to have a Build Back Better World. And we're going to invest, and we're going to build around the world, give democracies an ability so the rest of the countries don't fall prey to those like the Belt and Road Initiative out of China and other initiatives where there's, ""I'll do something for you if you give me""if you give me.
Folks, look, these bills are not about left versus right or about moderate versus progressive or anything that pits one American against one another. These bills are about competitiveness versus complacency. They're about expanding opportunity, not having opportunity denied. They're about leading the world and continuing to let the worldor let it pass us by.
And by the way, they will not increase one single penny of the deficit. They are fully paid for. And all of Wall Street points out they will grow employment by tens of thousands of peopletens of thousands of people. Seventeen Nobel laureates spontaneouslyNobel laureates in economyin the economysent me a letter 3 weeks ago saying it will also reduce, not increase inflation.
Here's what these initiatives are all about. First, the infrastructure bill. When I say ""infrastructure"" back home, people look like: ""Infrastructure? What the hell you talking about, Joe?"" They know infrastructure generically. But it's about rebuilding the arteries of our economy. That's what it's about.
Across this country right now, there are 45,000 bridges, according to the society of engineers45,000a significant portion that are ready to fall. Fall. Fall into the water or into the gap that they cover. There are 173 [thousand]* miles of roads in poor conditions that have to be built up, including more than 3,300 bridges and over 7,500 miles of highways here in the State of Pennsylvania that need to be repaired and built. Increased timing and commerce.
We're going to put hard-working Americans on the job to bring our infrastructure up to speed, good union jobsnot $7 an hour or $15 an hour, but prevailing wagea wage you can raise your family on, you can look at your family with pride; jobs that can't be outsourced; jobs replacing lead water pipes, like you have here in the Scranton area.
Kids are getting brain damage because of the ingestion of lead. Clean water all across America. We're going to replace every single lead pipe in the Nation, again, creating jobs but doing more than that: increasing the health and well-being of our children. Forty-four thousand schools are in a position where they have lead pipes. You send your kid to the water fountain, you've got to wonder about it.
Jobs laying thousands of miles of transmission lines and building a modern energy grid. Folks, we're in a situation now where you see what's happening. I've flown all over this country since coming in. You realize more of our land has been burned to the groundburned to the ground in the West and in the Northwest than the entire State of New Jersey? Every single square mile in New Jerseymore has been burned down this yearthis yearin the West because of climate change and because of electric utilities failing, wires falling.
We know if we can put these wires underground, we increase exponentially the service, but it costs a lot of money. We have to do it. We know that if we, in fact, allow people to be able to storewe have this incredible energy.
We haveI've visited one of the largest solar fields in America. It's in the Southwest. Guess what? You can transmit all that energy, enough to really light up half thehalf of the State of Nevada. But guess what? How do you transmit it? What lines do you put it over? Do we have the capacity to do that? We have the engineering capacity, but do we have the will to do it? And imagine what that does.
You realize we had $90 billion in loss this calendar year because of natural disasters? Ninety billion dollars.
Jobs. Making sure there's high-speed internet, affordable and available anywhere, everywhere in America, including for nearly one in six families who go without internet. They're kind ofyou saw what's happened when we've had this COVID.
Try teaching from home. How many people did you see out in McDonald's parking lots with their kids in their carsbecause they get access to the internetto be able to help the kid in school? What are we doing? This is the United States of America, dammit. What are we doing?
And both these bills are going to help us meet the moment on the climate crisis in a way that creates good jobs, makes us more economically competitive.
Sixty-six billion dollars in passenger rail and freight rail. Why do I always talk about passenger rail, and particularly high-speed rail? You realize the Chinese are now building another high-speed rail line that will go up to 300 miles per hour? You say, ""What difference does that make, Biden?"" Well, guess what? If you can get in a train and go from here to Washington much faster than you can go in an automobile, you take a train. You take the train. We will take literally millions of automobiles off the roadoff the roadsaving tens of millions of barrels of oil, dealing with cleaning up the air.
This is not hyperbole, this is a fact. These are facts. Right now, when I went out to Silicon Valley, they showed we're in a situation where if you put solar panels on your roofguess what?when the sun is not shining, you're in trouble, except they have now battery technology. You can have batteries in your basement, about the size of the width of this podium and about that thick, that will keep you going for 7 days.
So what do we have in this legislation? We have $39 billion to modernize American transit.
I remember riding the trolley. I lived at the end of the line, as they say, in Green Ridge. Three blocksthe end of the line. And beyond the end of the line were the dumps. And Maloney field was on the right. And the Little League Baseball field I played in was down in the bottom of the hill.
But the point is: It made to work. Most people live in cities. You know, the vast majority of people nowworking peoplelive in cities; their jobs are out of town, no longer in town. No longer in town. But 65 percent do not own an automobile. They live in a Black or Hispanic neighborhood or a poor neighborhood. And all the time they waste trying to get to work.
Look, more than $7 billion to build out the national network of electric vehicle charging stations.
The way my grandpop got up heremy Grandpop Biden, who died at Mercy Hospital of an aneurysm when he was 46 years old, 2 months before I was born in Mercy Hospitalhe was with the American Oil Company. He was up here opening up gas stations in nineteenthat's how he got here. This was 1942late '42.
Well, guess what? The same thing happens. We build these charging stations, what happens? Communities build up around them. You get everything from the figurative McDonald's or the Dunkin' Donuts to the drugstore.
And $21 billion for environmental cleanup and remediation. Look, it means putting people to work in a good job, prevailing wages, capping hundreds of thousands of abandoned wells in Southeastern Pennsylvania and in Ohio. Get the same salary that you paid the mine worker to dig the well. They've got to be capped. We have thousands of them that need to be capped.
In addition to that, we have methane leaks that are all over. And you all understand in Pennsylvania about that. But guess what? It increases the health of the community and provides good-paying jobs.
My plan also makes a historic investment in clean energy, including a tax credit for people to do things like winterize their homes, install solar panels, develop clean energy products, help businesses produce more clean energy. It's real, I promise you.
I won't be around to see it, but I promise you: Your kids are going to see a time when they're not, in fact, generating any energy from the homes here in Scranton other than renewable energy. Not a joke.
And by the way, one of the things the President put me in charge of myI want to be clear here[laughter]President Obama put me in charge of when I was Vice PresidentI was able to invest in that legislation that we put togetherI put together. We brought down the price of theof solar and wind cheaper than coal and cheaper than oil on a BTU basis. It's cheaper.
Coal built this town and this part of the country, but we've got to provide other avenues for people to make the same of kind of living they used to be able to make.
Look, all toldI just said this project is going to save, literally, hundreds of millions of barrels of oil annually. But folks here in Pennsylvania know the cost of inaction when it comes to climate change. Extreme weather has cost this State $10 billion over the last decade. And nationally, as I said, extreme weather conditions cost $99 billion last year.
And I flew over all this territory in helicopterin Marine Onenot a joketo see it. See reservoirs that are down 60, 80 feet. Concern about the Colorado River, whether or not we're going to be able to keep things moving. Not a joke. It's real. This is serious stuff.
And so, you know, it's not going to ease up on its own. We have to invest in our resilience, building roads higher. We camewhen I say, ""build back better,"" we're the only country in the world, historically, that's gone through a crisis and has come out at the other end better than before the crisis hit. That's who we are as Americans. Not a joke. Think about it.
For those if you who teach history, think about it: We come out better than it was before, because we don't give up. We invest. We trust our instincts. And so that's what I'm talking about. You know, we need morestronger levees; stronger power grids, more durable, able to withstand the ever-increasing ferocity and intensity of extreme weather.
Any roadit used to be, if you have a catastrophe and the road gets washed out, you build it back to what it was before. You can't build it back to the same standard. You've got to build the road back literally highernot a jokebecause the weather has already changed. And if we don't do something before we reach 1.5 degrees Celsius, we're in trouble.
Look, I haven't passedwe haven't passed a major infrastructure bill for decades in this country. The last 4 years, you'd hearevery month was, you know, ""Infrastructure Month."" Didn't do a single, damn thing. Nothing. I mean nothing for 4 years. We can't afford to sit while other countries pass us by. We're going to breathe new life into the economy and our workforce.
And here's the deal: These jobs will createthat we're going to create for people who are too often left out and left behind. The vast majority of the jobs in my infrastructure bill don't require a 4-year degree; 98 percent don't require a 4-year degree.
Guess what, though? This is the ultimate blue-collarblue-collar, middle class renewal; real serious work that needs to get done. Folks, it isn't enough just to invest in our physical infrastructure, we also have to invest in our people, which we always did. We invested in our people.
That's why the second bill is the so-called Build Back Better plan. And here's what it does: It takes educationas I said, when America made 12 years of public education standard a century ago, it gave us the best-educated, best-prepared workforce in the world, and you saw what happened. Think of what would have happened after World War I and how America moved, because we were the best educatedoverallcountry in the world. And we led in the 20th century.
But as I said earlier, we know those 12 years is not enough any longer to compete in the 21st century. Study after study shows that earlier our children begin to learn, the better for themselves, their families, and for the Nation.
You know, you all know the statisticsand some of your teachers and your husband used to talk to me about thisand it was really basic: that if you come from a home where the mom or dad have books on the shelves and on the coffee table and read, and you come from a home where mom or dad can't read or has a sixth-grade education or has a little difficulty, the child coming from that middle class home is going to have heard a million more words spokennot different words, spokenspokenthan the child coming from a middle class home.
And that's becauselook, what do you all do? You all know with your children or your grandchildren. You start talking to them when they're in the cradle. You engage them. They're the people who sit at the dinner table and still talk; they're engaged. So many homes, mothers or fathers, don't have the capacity or inclination to do that. But right now what are we doing? We're lagging behind.
Today, only about half of the 3- and 4-year-olds in America are enrolled in early education at all. Germany, France, the U.K., Latviatheir number is over 90 percent of the children.
It's not just early education. According to one study, we rank 12th among advanced economies when it comes to percentage of our young people who have attained any sort of post-high school degree. Ranked 12th in the world.
The Build Back Better plan gets us back on track. We'll make 2 years of high-quality preschool available to every child in America. Every child. And we're going to make investments education beyond high school. That includes increasing Pell grants, which nearly 200,000 students in Pennsylvania from low-income families rely on to attend college. We're going to increase it by $500. It's up toso it becomes $1,900.
The bill invests in our workforce, providing much-needed breathing room for families.
My dad used toI remember, when we moved to Wilmington, we finally were able toafter 4 years, Dad could buy a house. And we lived in a, quote, ""a development."" It was a lovely area and a suburban area. But it was a three-bedroom, split-level home. And we had four kids and my grandpop who lived with us or another relative allfor all those years we lived there.
And my bed was upmy headboardwell, notdidn't have a headboard. But my bed was up against the wall that was onmy dad and mom's bed was up against the wall. And I look back, and Iit was great for us having grandpops and relatives there. I don't know how my parents quite did it.
But I remember one nightI'm seriousit was in high school. And DadI could seeI could feel my dad was restless. He was moving. I could hear it in bed. And I asked the next morningI asked my momit's a true story. I said, ""What's the matter with Dad, Mom?"" She said: ""He got bad news, honey. His company just said they're no longer going to pay for health insurance."" Well, guess what? My dad used to say: ""Everybody is entitled. All we're looking for is just a little breathing room."" Just a little bit of extra rooma little breathing room.
How can we compete in the world if millions of American parents, especially moms, who can't join the workforce because they can't afford the cost of childcare or eldercare, or they have to stay home?
I heard my colleagues speaking before I did. Here in Pennsylvania, the average annual cost of childcare for your toddler is $11,400. It's higher in other places. So an average two-parent family with two young kids spends 22 percent of their income for childcare every year.
I was a single dad for 5 years. I got elected to the Senate; I got a phone call before I got sworn in, when I was hiring staff, saying my wife and daughter had just been killed and my two boys were seriously injured. They were hospitalized for a long time.
So Ithat's why I eventually started commuting. But I continued to commute because I could no more affordand I was making a lot of money then. Now, granted, I was listed for 36 years as the poorest man in Congress, but[laughter]I was making $42,000 a year. And I didn't think my job was to make money when I was in Congress.
But this is not a joke. I could no more afford childcare than fly. But fortunately, I had a hell of a family, those values I talked about. My sister and her husband, after a little bit, they gave up their home. I came home one night, and they were moved into my home, helped me raise my kids.
Five years laterno man deserves one great love, let alone two. Five years later, when I met and married Jill, I came home after the wedding; they had moved out.
My brother Jimmy, my best friend, my motherthey all helped me take care of my kids. But I couldn't have done it. So I understand. How in God's name do people make it?
If you look at the world of advanced economics andthose advancedthose with advanced economies, their countries invest an average ofeach of those countries invest an average of $14,000 per year in childstate-sponsored child/toddler care. America invests $500, 28 times less than our competitors.
Here's what it does to our economyyou all know it: Thirty years ago, we ranked seven inseventh in the world among advanced economies in the share of women in the workforce. Today, in America, we rank 23d.
And women are becomingnot a jokebetter educated than men. If you look atand I do about five college commencements a year. Four of those five, the valedictorian out of those classes for the last 10 years has been a woman. And if you read the data now, we're worried about the number of men attending college.
Once again, our competitors are investing. We're standing still. My Build Back Better plan is designed to get us moving again.
Look, it's going to cut the cost of childcare for most Pennsylvania families in half. No middle-income family will pay more than 7 percent of their income on childcare under my proposal. Seven percent. It's going to help more people get back to work in a workforce and make ends meet.
It's also going to extend the historic middle class tax cut for parents. Everybody talks aboutand by the way, I have aI'm going to say something self-servingbut I got on pretty well in the Senate for all those years: a lot of Republican friends, as well as Democratic friends. For real. Kind of like Bobby. I mean, Ithey're friends. We used to travel together a lot.
And here's the deal though: You know, what I was able to do when we passed the American Rescue Plan in the first month of my administration, which has allowed us to have all the funding for COVID. And when I started off, there were 2 million people in America that had gotten a vaccine. Well, guess what? We're up to 190 million. That's how we got it paid for.
But here's the deal: What it meant waswhat it meant wasthat, you know, right now there's a whole new attitude that's out there. How do we not invest? And so, in that act that we passed, we provided for a child tax credit, and you heard my introducer speak to it. Because we were in such dire straits, we were able to put into position a tax cut for middle class people. That's what it is. No one has a tax cutwe want to cut the capital gains tax for the wealthy or anybodyno one has a problem when we deal with that.
We have over 55 corporations in Americathe Fortune 500don't pay a single, solitary penny in taxes. Not 1 cent. Not 1 cent. They make $40 billion a year. But when you talk about a tax cut for middle class peopleand that's exactly what it is.
By what we did, increasingmaking a refundable tax cutyou know, the way it works now: If you've made enough money to haveowe more than $4,000 in taxes and you had two kids, you got to deduct it. And here's the deal: The fact of the matter is that if you didn't make that kind of money, you didn't get the benefit at all. It wasn't refundable; you didn't get the benefit at all of the tax cut. Because if you didn't have more than $4,000 in taxes, you didn'tyou know, you still paid. And youit wasn't refundable; you didn't get it back.
Well, here's the way we work it: We said, ""All right, fortemporarily, what we're going to do is make sure there's a childcare tax credit. And if you have one kid under seven, you get 3,600 bucks a year. And if you have one over 7 to 17, you get $3,000 a year."" We upped it from $2,000. Well, guess what? It's cut child poverty in Pennsylvania by 55 percent; in the Nation by 50 percent. It's a flat-out tax cut for ordinary people. That's what it does. I make no apologies for it.
But look, folks, there are so many things that we can do to change the way in which we work all of this. And I'm realizing I'm going on here, but the fact is there's so much at stakeso much at stake.
Look, the fact is that, most of all, what it does isyou know, we have a sandwich generation that exists, and many of you are part of that generation. You have a mom or dad who need some help when they get older, and you have a child that needs some help if you're going to be able to be in the workforce. And it's hard as hellhard as hellto make it work. You've got to give these folks a little bit of breathing room. The single greatest champion for eldercare in the United States of America is this guy right here, Bobby Casey. Not a joke. Not a joke.
The way it works right now: If you qualify for Medicaidyou have to have a lower income to qualify for Medicaidnot Medicare, Medicaidthere are 820,000 seniors, people withor people with disabilities, who are on Medicaid, on a waiting list to get home care, which they're entitled to.
How many families are living this story? Your parents get older, they need some help getting around the house, making the meals for themselves; don't want to put them in nursing homes, onlynot only because of the cost, but because of a matter of dignity.
They do better, they live longer if they can stay in their own home. But you also don't have the time or the money to take care of them at home, to do it. So you're just looking for an answer so your parents can keep living independently.
And if they hold here a second, one of the things that is importantthink about this: In order to get into that nursing home, you've got to sell everything you have. You can't have any private property. You have to empty your bank account. You have to do it all to move into a nursing home.
I'm not saying nursing homes aren't valuable; they are. They're extremely valuable. But that's not whereI remember my uncle wasmoved in with his wife into an assisted living center. And he wantedand the folks whowho had built the facilityit was a lovely facility in Delawareasked if I'd come and speak on the opening of it. And we're walking out, and I said, ""Mom, isn't this beautiful?"" She looked at me and saidand she was then 76 years oldshe said: ""This is for old people, Joey. Not for me.""
I'mbut think about it: For millions of families, this is the most important issue they're facing. It's personal. It's personal. And Bob Casey gets it. When Bobby fights for something, he never gives up, in case you haven't noticed.
So here's what we're going to do: We're going to expand services for seniors so families can get help with well-trained, well-paid professionals to help them take care of their parents at home, to cook a meal for them, to get them their groceries when they need to get groceries, to help them get around, to just put in railings on their home.
When my mom lived with meshe moved in with mewe finally talked her into doing it. And guess what? My sister takes her upyou remember this? Jeanie remembers thistalking about this too. She takes her up to get her prescriptions, drives her back, gets out of the house. And she wasit was this little home off of our home. It wasshe wouldn't move intophysically move into the house, even though we'd done the whole thing over for her. And she's just standing there and moves and breaks her hip. She didn't trip or anything. Broke her hip.
Well, guess what? Just having a railing, just having a place where she could walk from one room to the other and to help them in their own home with the dignity they deserve. Quite frankly, what we found is that this is more popular than anything else I'm proposing.
When you do this individual polling data, this is extremely popular, because we all feel that obligation to our parents. And we want them to live with dignity, look, because the American people understand the need. It's a matter of dignity. It's a matter of pride.
Look, that's what both these initiatives are all about. And frankly, they're about more than giving working families a break; they're about positioning our country to compete in the long haul. Economists left, right, and center agree.
Earlier this year, the Wall Street outfit, Moody's, projected that the investments I'm talking about will create for the next 20 years, on average, 2 million additional jobs per year, good-paying jobs. It's transformative. And we can make these transformation investments and be fiscally responsible.
Take the infrastructure bill. All those investments in roads, bridges, high-speed rail, internetthe whole dealthey represent less than one-half of 1 percent of our economic growth each yearless than one-half of 1 percent.
And the cost of the Build Back Better bill, in terms of adding to the deficit, is zerois zerozero, because we're going to pay for it all. In addition to that, half of it is a tax cut. It's not spending money; it's a tax cut for working class people.
And it's about time, as I saidand I come from the corporate State of the world. Not a joke. More corporations are inregistered in my State than every other State in the United States combined. And I represented the State of DuPont, as they used to call it, for 36 years. I'm not antibusiness, but I'm about, ""Just begin to pay your fair share.""
Look, folks, under this proposaland under this proposalthese proposals I'm talking aboutI guarantee you that no one making under $400,000 a year will see one single penny in tax go up. Not one. In fact, the plan cuts taxes for working people.
And by the way, if you notice theyou know, the way you usually pay for infrastructure billinfrastructure is by gasoline taxes? I wouldn't allow that because that would tax people making under $400,000. I'm a man of my word. Not one single penny, when you payif you make more thanless than $400,000.
Sobut there's no reasonthere's no reasonwhy someone making 400 million [thousand]* a yearand by the way, you know, during thisall the crisis we've had with COVID, there's an absolute finite number of billionaires they can count up in the Tax Code. You know how much money the billionaires made last year, collectively? And they're not bad guys; I'm not saying that. They made $1 trillionincreased their collective income$1 trillion. Just pay your fair share.
You know, if you are a multi-millionaire or a billionaire, you have a lower tax rate than a family who has a teacher and a firefighter as a percent of taxes you paylower. As I said, 55 of our largest corporations pay zero in income tax40 billion bucks. This needs to change.
Working folks understand that. That's why that despite the attacks and misinformation about my plans, they're still overwhelming supported by the American people. They understand that when families have a little breathing room, America is in a better spot. And they know this is about dignity and respect, about building an economy from the bottom up and the middle, not from the top down.
As I said, name me a time in American history when the middle class has done well, but the wealthy haven't done very well. Name me a time.
So let me close with this: For too long, the working people of this Nation, the middle class in this countrythe backbone of the countryhave been dealt out. It's time to deal them back in.
I ran for President saying it was time to rebuild the backbone of the Nation. And by that, I was very precise: The middle class has been the backbone of this Nation. I couldn't have been any clearer. That's why I wrote both these bills in the first place and took them to the people. I campaigned on them, and the American people spoke.
I ranthey have no doubt about what I ran on. Both these bills were all what I talked about. But guess what? Eighty-one million people voted for me. More people voted than at any time in American history. And their voices deserve to be heard, not to be denied, or worse, be ignored.
Because here's what I know: If we make the investments, there's going to be no stopping America in the remainder of the 21st century.
I've long saidand I mean this to every world leader I've knownand I've now spoken to over 60 of them, and I've known themmany of them before thatI tell them it's never, ever, ever been a good bet to bet against America. No, never. Never, never. Which means it's always a good bet to bet on America.
And that's what these initiatives do: They bet on America. It's about believing in the American people. It's about believingabout believing. Just look at the history of the journey of this Nation. What becomes clear is this: Given half a chancehalf a chancethe American people have never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever let the country down. Just a fighting chance; no guarantees. Just a chance. And that's what this is all about.
And it does not increase the debt. When you talk about the numberwe shouldn't even talk about the numbers, because it's all paid for, written in the same piece of legislation. So, when you pass the spending, you're also passing the tax cuts, and you're passing the taxes that are going to be increased.
Scranton, thanks for always treating me so nicely. I really mean it.
God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you.

2021-10-18 00:00:00,Remarks Honoring the 2020 and 2021 National Teachers of the Year and State Teachers of the Year and an Exchange With Reporters,"
The President. My name is Joe Biden; I'm Jill's husband. [Laughter] Please. Please, sit down. Please. Please, please, please.
Well, Mr. Secretary, as they say in parts of Claymont I am from, you've done good, fella. [Laughter] As you can see, I didn't get my English lessons from Jill. [Laughter]
Also here is a good friend of mine: chairman and the Congressman, Bobby Scott. Bobby, stand up.
The First Lady. Hey, Bobby.
The President. And, Randi, thank you, thank you, thank you. We kept our commitment, didn't we?
The First Lady. Yes. That's what I said. [Laughter]
The President. All right. And I just want you to know, Becky, you know, Jill is a member of the union. I hope her dues are paid up. [Laughter]
The First Lady. They are.
The President. They are? Okay. I just want to check. I just want to check.
There's nowhere we'd would rather be than with educators. You know, when we decided to run and we got electedJill elected me[laughter]you all think I'm kidding, huh? [Laughter] Well, what happened was that we started thinking about it, and I knew immediately. Jill said, ""By the way""and I said: ""It's okay with me. Teach full time."" She's the onlyshe's the only First Lady who's ever had a full-time job.
Now, the fact that I don't ever get to see her, the fact that she is either traveling on behalf of the people of this country or going to her classroom teaching 15 credits at the community college is a different story. But it is who she is. Like I heard her sayshe probably said; I heard her say many times: Teaching is not what you all do, it's who you are. It's what you're made of.
And you know, one of the things that II used the line years agothat I still think is relevant in a slightly different context: You know, when you think about it, the single most consequential people in the world, beyond our parentsGod willing, if we have themis our teachers. You are the ones whoyou're the kite strings that lift our national ambitions aloft. I mean it. Not a joke. It's a reality. It's a reality.
One of the reasons why we're working so hardand the Secretary is helping so muchin the Build Back Better plan is that the rest of the world is starting to figure this out; the rest of the world is starting to outeducate us. Early education is earlier and more prevalent in European countries. A significant numberwe rank number 34 out of 37 industrial nations in the world in the number of where we rank in terms of people getting a degree beyond high school.
And so we have to get back in step. And you're all the reasons. You're the best of the best. You know, for all of ityou know, by the way, where are my two Delaware teachers?
Audience member. Here! [Laughter]
Secretary of Education Miguel A. Cardona. That's hilarious.
The President. Who's New Castle? New Castle! All right. [Laughter]
You can see we're not at all proud of Delaware. [Laughter] My dad used to always say: Never forget where you came from. As they say, them's the one that brung me to the dance. You know?
But I want to thank Rebecca, and I thankof the Colonial Education Program in New Castle. And Kimberly of McKean High School in Wilmington.
2021 Delaware Teacher of the Year Kimberly Stock of Thomas McKean High School in Wilmington, DE. That's me!
The President. That's you. Okay! All right. [Laughter]
And now, to the two National Teachers of the Year: It's a pretty big deal. I listened to both of your speeches, and they're very impressive. And I mean it sincerely: What you do really matters. What you do really matters. And it matters in a way that I think you all don't fully realize. I don't think aboutI'll betyou know, I look at every important decision I made in my life. I ask myself three thingsnot a joke: what my dad and mom would think I should do.
But when we decided toI'm just going to tell you a quick story. When I decided to help pick someone who was going to be the nominee for the Democratic PartyI was asked in Delaware to go out and try to find a candidate for the United States SenateI was 28 years old, as part of this group of people. And I kept trying to get people towho were consequentialto get involved, and they didn't want to do it. And Nixon was running that year. It was going to be a lead-pipe cinch; Republicans are going to win. And I was a Democrat.
And so I showed up at a Democratic conventionan off-year conventionand I went to make sure that everything was going to be okay. And I would report toI was the kid at the convention. And it was in Dover, Delaware.
And, after the afternoon session, I went back to the hotela typical hotela motel where you drive up, you get out the car, and you walk in the door. And I was in there, I was shaving, and I had a towel around me, and I was in the bathroomwhich is, like, 8 by 10and two beds where the headboard is nailed to the wall[laughter]and a desk nailed to the wall.
And all of a sudden, I hear, ""Bam! Bam! Bam!"" There's banging on my door. And I thought it was a guya great friend named by Bob Cunningham and a guy named Dennis. I thought they were coming to pick me up, and I thought I was late.
So I went to the door with shaving cream and razor in my hand, towel on. I opened the door, and who's standing there, but the former Governor of the State of Delaware. [Laughter] Swear to God. A former chief justice of the State Supreme Court and Rhodes Scholar. And more members of his family were United States Senators than any family in American history. Thirdly, a Congressman who had been defeated earliera great guy, a five-term Congressmanand a guy named Henry Topel, who was the State chairman.
And they said, ""We're coming in."" I said[laughter]and I had not met two of them personally. Two I hadn't met. And I'm in my towel. [Laughter] I mean, I'm in a towel with shaving cream on my face.
And so I stepped back. I said: ""Oh, gentlemen. Okay. Please come in."" And I went into the bathroom thinking I'm going to getput something on. I get in, and I realized there's nothing to put on. [Laughter]
So I wiped the shaving cream off my face, and I walk out, and I was mortified. And I said, ""I'm sorry, gentlemen."" They said, ""It's okay."" And there were two of themeach on the end of each of the two beds that were facing me. And I'm against the desk like this.
And this guy, Henry Topel, said thathe was from New York. He said: ""Joe, we just had dinner. We were thinking, and you should run for the United States Senate."" And I said, ""Oh, geez."" I said, ""Mr. Chairman""I said, ""I'm not old enough."" And the then-chief justiceretired chief justiceof course, said, ""Joe, obviously, you didn't do very well in law school."" [Laughter]
I looked at him. He said: ""It says you have to be 30 years old to be sworn in, not to be elected. You can beand you'll turn 30 by the time it's time to be sworn in."" And anyway, that was my exposureno pun intended[laughter].
And so I go to the event, and I'm riding home with this guy, Bob Cunningham, who was a really bright guy, and I said: ""Bob, I don't know what in God's name I'm going to do. This is crazy."" And so I'm thinking, ""Who am I going to talk to?"" True story.
And the next morning, I get up and I called my professor at the University of Delaware, a guy named Dr. Ingersoll. And I said, ""Doctor, can I come down and see you?"" And he said, ""Of course."" I went down and sat with him for a half an hour. I told him what was happening. He just looked at me, and he said, ""Joe, remember what Plato said."" And I'm thinking, ""What the hell did Plato say?"" [Laughter] But he said, ""To paraphrase Plato, he said the penalty good people pay for not being involved in politics is being governed by people worse than themselves.""
And he looked at me, and he said, ""Joe, you should run."" I said, ""But I feel strongly about all of these issues, but I""I had gotten involved in the civil rights movement and the warbut Ihe said, ""Joe, you should do it."" He had enough confidence in me that he gave me confidence in myself. With a kid with no money, coming from a middle class family, who grew up in grade school stuttering, literally, for me, I'm confident I would have never done it were it not for Dr. Ingersoll.
I'm sure there are peopleeach of youyou can look back at, and they've changed your life. But most of all, what you do is, you give us confidence. You instill confidence. Just like when I was a kid when I used to stutter badly, the nuns would sit me down and they'd say, ""Joey, you can do this,"" and practiced with me. They gave me confidence.
And so, folks, you know, as Jill always says, ""Teaching is not who youwhat you do, it's who you are.""
And it also isIlet me conclude by saying this about something thatas a strong proponent of education, I became friendsand Jill as wellbut I became friends with Colin Powell, who we just lost.
Think of where Colin Powellhe's not only a dear friend and a patriot, one of our great military leaders, and a man of overwhelming decency, but this is the guy born the son of immigrants in New York City, raised in Harlem, in the South Bronx, graduated from City College of New York. And he rose to the highest ranks not only in the military, but also in areas of foreign policy and statecraft.
This is a guyand we talk about itwho had teachers who looked at this African American kid and said, ""You can do anything.""
So all I want to say to you, really, is: Don't underestimate. Don't underestimate what you do. The good news about you all is, you underestimate it so you come off in a way that you don't feel self-important. But you're gigantic. You make a gigantic difference.
And I learned that when Jill and I would walk through the malls on Christmas time when I was a Senator, and kids would go, ""Hey, hey, hey!"" And I'd wave. [Laughter] And they'd say: ""No, no, no, no. Dr. Biden! Dr.""[laughter]. Swear to God.
So, folks, thank you for what you do. I really mean it. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
And now I've got a few little gifts to give here.
The First Lady. This is for Tabitha.
The President. Tabatha, can you come up here? I don't want to drop this. Do you want to hand it to her?
The First Lady. No, you hand it to her.
2020 National Teacher of the Year Tabatha Rosproy of Winfield Early Learning Center. Me neither. [Laughter]
The President. Tabitha, this is
The First Lady. For 2020.
The President. Twenty-twentyI know, but this isthis apple is worth $280,000. [Laughter]
Ms. Rosproy. I can retire.
The President. No, I'mI'm joking. But I want you to have this and to tell youlet you know how much we appreciate you and all you do.
Ms. Rosproy. Thank you.
The President. Thank you.
Ms. Rosproy. Thank you so much.
The President. I'm not sure if[inaudible].
Ms. Rosproy. [Laughter] I'll be really careful.
The President. Okay, good. All right.
The First Lady. And this is Juliana's.
The President. Juliana, come on up here. Juliana, I had a great friend who was a former Senator from Texas who looked at me one dayhe's passed away nowand he said, ""Joe, you'll never get elected President unless you can learn to speak Spanish.""
2021 National Teacher of the Year Juliana Urtubey of Kermit R. Booker, Sr. Innovative Elementary School in Las Vegas, NV. Smart man.
The President. Well, guess what? I decided to hire everybody who spoke Spanish. [Laughter]
Secretary Cardona. Yes.
Ms. Urtubey. Muy bien.
The President. But congratulations. It's a great honor, and I'm delighted to have an opportunity to meet you.
Ms. Urtubey. Thank you, Mr. President.
The President. Thank you very much.
[At this point, the ceremony concluded, and the President greeted recipients and posed for photographs. As he prepared to go back inside the White House, he addressed reporters as follows.]
Death of Former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell/COVID-19 Vaccinations 
Q. Mr. President, can you say a few more words about Colin Powell and histhe fact that he got COVID despite being vaccinated?
The President. Well, by the way, he had serious underlying conditions, as you know. That's the problem. It wasn't that he gotthe vaccinations are good, but he had two very serious underlying conditions. And unfortunately, it didn't work. God love him.
Q. So what's your message to Americans? Should they still get vaccinated?
The President. Absolutely. No[inaudible]I know youI know you don't believe that. Ask questions that you really, really want an answer to. Okay?
Senator Joseph A. Manchin III 
Q. Okay. How are you going to get Joe Manchin to agree? That's what we want to know.
The President. I'm going to go do that right now. That's where I'm going.

2021-10-16 00:00:00,Remarks at the National Peace Officers Memorial Service,"
Thank you, Sergeant. My name is Joe Biden. I am Jill Biden's husband. [Laughter] That's how I'm better known.
President Yoes, Auxiliary President Hennie, Auxiliary President Layman andexcuse me, Lehmannand a guy I've known for a long, long time, Jimmy Pasco, executive director: Thank you for this invitation to be with you today.
The Secretary of Homeland Security Mayorkas, thank you for being here and for the great job you're doing for us. Thank you very, very much. And it's a tough job.
Most importantly, to the families here today, this is all about youabout you. You know, I've been coming to this memorial for 40 years. I missed a couple, butand I've spoken at manytoo many police memorials all around the country. And it always amazes me how the public doesn't fully understand what we expect of our law enforcement officers.
We expect you to be people ready to stand in the way and take a bullet for us. We expect you to be able to track down the bad guys. We expect you to be the psychologist who talks the couple that are having a violent confrontation together to step back. We expect you to be everything. We expect everything of you. And it's beyond the capacity of anyone to meet the total expectations. Being a cop today is one hell of a lot harder than it's ever been.
And to the families of the fallen: You've suffered an enormous loss. But understand, your loss is also America's loss. America's loss. And your pain is America's pain. We're waking up to the notion that unless we change the environment in which the job can be done, we're going to have trouble having enough women and men come forward to want to do the job.
I hope all the familiessons, daughters, husbands, wives, moms, dadsI hope you're able to take a measure of comfort and strength from the extended family you have here and all around you. In remembrance and respect of this memorial and this day, I ordered our flags to be flown at halfstaff.
We've met here, in front of this United States Capitol, many times before to memorialize our fallen heroes. And it's particularly appropriate today, because here, 9 months ago, your brothers and sisters thwarted an unconstitutional and fundamentally un-American attack on our Nation's values and our votes. But because of you, democracy survivedbut only because of the women and men of the U.S. Capitol Police force, the Washington, DC, Metropolitan Police Department, and other law enforcement agencies who once again, literally, put their bodies on the line to protect our democracy.
That's why I have no hesitationhad none at allin signing the law awarding the Congressional Gold Medal of Congressthe highest expression of our Nation's appreciationto the U.S. Capitol Police and Washington, DC, Metropolitan Police and other responding law enforcement agencies. Because of these men and women, we averted a catastrophe. But their heroism came at a cost to you and your families: 150 officers injured; 5 lost in the attack's aftermath.
The toll on this profession these past years has been heavytoo heavy; 2020 was the deadliest year for law enforcement on record. And today we're here to remember nearly 500 of your brothers and sisters, husbands and wives, sons and daughters2019 and 2020, we lost so much.
I've attended this memorial many times, as I said, to pay my respects. Sometimes, I've been the speaker; other times, I've sat on this stage and just thought about all of you sitting on the lawn. Although this year, I don't know any that personallywho have fallen, any of the individuals; I've gone through all the namesI feel I know them withnotwithout having ever met them.
You see, I grew up in a neighborhooda neighborhood in Scranton, Pennsylvania; and Claymont, Delaware; and Bellefonte, where I grew up with the guys and women that we're honoring today. One of my best friends in grade school, Eddie Hill, became a superintendent of the Delaware State Police, a great friend and competitor in the other major high school. We played ball against one another. Charlie Dougherty became the head of thechief of the Wilmington Police force. And so many more. So, although I didn't know them personally, I know you. I know you.
I always joke that I grew up in places where you either became a cop, a firefighter, or a priest. I wasn't qualified for them, so I had to settle for this. [Laughter]
But all kidding aside, over the years, as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I've gotten to know you. Even as kids, we could see, in the women and men around us, who are the ones who had the heart. They're the ones who ran in to help you when everyone else was running away. They ran toward cries for help, even when they were in grade school, knowing that they'd be able to help a little bit, even if they were outnumbered.
And I'm not making this up. Think about it. Think about your son, your daughter, your husband, your wife, who they were, what was inside them. It was about service, to protect, defend. This isn't just what law enforcement does, it's who you are. It's what makes you who you are. And when you put on that shield in the morning and walk out the door each day, every family member dreads the possibility of receiving that phone call.
I was talking to Steny about this. Just as our son Beau was in Kosovo for about 6 months and in Iraq for a year, he was the chief law enforcement officer for the State of Delaware, the attorney general. And I'd watch every morningbecause she left for school before I got on the trainJill standing there mouthing a prayer while she drank a cup of coffee over the sink, prayingpraying for Beau. Well, you do it every day. You did it every day.
You know, there's a line from an English poet, John Milton. He said, ""They also serve who only stand and wait."" How long have you had to stand and wait and wonder when you heard something on the news or saw it on television? Thousands and thousands of American families stand and wait so their husbands, their wives, their fathers, their mothers, sons and daughters, can serve the rest of us.
We not only owe them, we owe you. This is not hyperbole. I mean this from the bottom of my heart: We owe you, willing to support them. And too many of you sitting out there have received that terrible call that your loved one won't be coming home at the end of his or her shift.
To the mothers and fathers that are here today: My heart aches for you. Believe it or not, Jill and I understand. We got one of those calls in a different circumstance.
No parent should have to bury a child. I lost a baby daughter in an accident. I lost a brave son to cancer after coming home from a year in Iraq. But you know what? What you've gone through is hard. The fact that he was a chief law enforcement officer of Delaware, he wasn't out there literally. He'd go on patrols, but he wasn't out there walking up those stairs to make that arrest or try to stop that fight. He wasit was always about family.
It's like losing a piece of your soul. Some of you still have that feeling like you've been sucked into a black hole in your chest, wondering, ""My God, will it ever change?""
Sergeant McClain from Detroit, decorated for exemplary service during his 16-year career. He turned down promotions so he could continue to work as a mentor to other officers in his district. Every 2 weeks, he'd send his wife flowers at work, like clockwork, to brighten her day and her office. He was killed responding to a domestic violence call.
Officer Tiffany-Victoria Enriquez from Honolulu. She was one of two officers killed while responding to a call and was the first female officer to die in the line of duty in the Honolulu Police Department. Her boyfriend, also an officer, called her, quote, ""the most hard-working, amazing, fiercest officer I've ever known. My heart is shattered, and she was my love, my rock, my strength.""
So many. Officer Charles Brazexcuse me, Brazydloexcuse me, Barzyldopassed away in 2016, but he was recognized in his line of duty this year. He was part of an elite unit of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, a unit trained to perform technical rescue operations.
After the terrorists attacked on September 11, he was assigned to search and recoverrecovery efforts at the World Trade tower. He, like so many others, contracted cancer. He died of cancer following that assignment.
He made friends wherever he went. He loved the outdoors. He was his neighborhood go-to guy, organizing almost anything, including hunting expeditions.
As you call the roll today, we're acutely aware that behind each name are families. As I said, we know from personal experience that every time there's a ceremony or memorial honoring your lost husband or wife, son or daughter, it can summon that pride, but also that terrible feeling, as if you're just hearing the news for the first time.
So I want you to know: I know, although you looked forward to honoring your family member, it's hard. It's hard. I mean this sincerely: Jill and I admire your courage for just being here. And we hope you take some comfort in the knowledge that the men and women here assembled today, they'll always be with you. Not a joke. They'll always be with you, wherever you areand even if you don't know themin a city, a town, a place you've never been before.
And as much as we hope not, there are going to be more names added to this roll call of bravery and sorrow. There already have been. As I was preparing these remarks early this morning, in Houston, the deputy killedone deputy killed and two wounded.
Chief Finner from Houston is here today. I don't know where the chief is, but he's here today, I'm told. I've known himseven Houston Police officers in his department were killed in the line of duty since 2019. Chief, I'm here for you, pal, and so is everybody else. We mourn the fallen. We pray for the recovery of the wounded.
As I've said, I've spoken manytoo many times, too many funerals for police officers; too many funerals for brave servants who kept us safe. So, under the mournful sound of the bagpipes, we must also hear something else: a call to do better, to do more, to keep you safe, to keep our communities safer; for us to step up, to build trust and respect and heal the breach we now see in so many communities; to recognize that the promise of equal and impartial justice remains a promise but not always a reality for you or others, particularly in low-income communities, too many communities, Black and Brown. Too many families are grieving unnecessary losses of their sons, their daughters, their fathers, their brothers.
I want to acknowledge the FOP, as was mentioned earlier, for sincerely trying to reach an agreement on meaningful reforms, congressional reform, in the negotiations over the George Floyd [Justice]* in Policing Act. But here's the part: A lot of the help has to come to police departments. They need help to do better.
I want to thank you for being the constructive player in this process. We haven't gotten there yet, but we must get there. Look, there's too much pain. There's too much loss. There's too much at stake for the safety and for the safety of those you serve.
It's a hard time to be a police officer in America. So I want to make sure you have the tools to be the partners and the protectors your communities need; that when you look at what your communities need and what you're being asked to do, there isn't going to bethere are going to be more resources, not fewer resources, to help you do your job.
That's why I proposed we invest inwe invest again in community policing we know worksone thing that protects cops is another cop; in the training you and the community have requested, the community-based programs and interventions that can stop violence before it starts; provide specific guidance explaining that communities can and should use funds from the American Rescue Plan, $350 billion in aid to cities, States, counties, Tribes, to hire and retain officers. Many cities, from Albuquerque to Saint Paul, are doing just that.
And I proposed an additional $300 million in my budget to support community policing across the country. It's hard when you don't know the community. And the most important way to get to know themit has more police. We're also investing in community violence intervention programs, which are provenhave a proven track record of reducing violence by up to 60 percent in cities across the Nation.
At the same time, we have to stop asking law enforcement officers to do every single job under the Sun. I'm committed to investing in mental health services and mental health professionals who can respond to a mental health crisis alongside you. You shouldn't be the one having to talk someone off the edge of the roof. You should have professional help with you.
Support our law enforcement officersrequires that we invest in the systems that provide adequate health care, counseling, drug treatment and prevention, housing, education, and other social services in the community so there is not the discord.
We need to work together to confront the epidemic of gun violence. Your brothers and sisters have told me over the years, sometimes, you feel like you're ""outgunned."" Right now the Justice Department, under the leadership of Attorney General Garland, is working with State and local law enforcement across the country to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous individuals.
They now have zero tolerance for gun dealers who willfully violate the law, putting firearms into the hands of people who are a danger to the community and you. I also want to make it easier for States to adopt red-flag laws: laws that allow family members or law enforcement to petition a court order to temporarily remove firearms from people who are in crisis, representing a danger to themselves and to others. By the way, more people die of gunshot wounds in America as a consequence of suicide than any other reason.
I've called on Congress to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act and to close the domestic violence loophole to keep guns out of the hands of abusers. Forty percent of all calls that result in an officer's death were domestic violence related. Forty percent.
These steps will protect you, protect the people you serve.
And finally, and tragically, in the past 2 years, COVID-19 has caused more deaths in the line of duty than all of the other causes combined. Many of those lost their lives keeping our society safe, serving on the front lines in those dark, early days of the pandemic.
But now, let us prevent the preventable tragedies. The last time I stood here was to take the oath of office as your President. I said that day, we have ""much to repair, much to restore, much to heal, much to build, much to gain."" It remains true. I believe with all my heart there's nothing you're unable to do if we equip you; that we can unite this Nation and fight our common foes: anger, resentment, hatred, extremism, racism, lawlessness, violence, disease, joblessness, hopelessness.
We have never, ever failed in America when we've acted together. So let's act together to support you in the service of the Nation we love.
In closing, let me say that I know there are no words, no memorials that can fill that void, that black hole in your chest so many of you feel. But I promise you, the day will come when the memory of your loved one will bring a smile to your lips before it brings a tear to your eye. That's when you know you're going to make it. That's when you know. That will happen. But my prayer for you is that that day will come sooner than later.
There is a headstone in a cemetery in Ireland that reads: ""Death leaves a heartache no one can heal. Love leaves a memory that no one can steal."" They're with you. They're in your heart. They're part of you.
May the souls of those you love and those with whom you served rest in peace and rise in glory. In the meantime, you're in our prayers. May God bless you, and may God protect all those who serve us in uniform. Thank you.

Infrastructure, Jobs, Education, and Family Assistance Legislation 
Q. Mr. President, can you give us some details on the talks you've been having this week: who you've been talking to, what the focus has been, if there's been any specific progress?
The President. That wouldn't be appropriate. It's stillnegotiation is still going on. There has been progress, butand I'll be meeting with and talking with folks today and tomorrow and on Monday.
Climate Change Legislation/Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John F. Kerry 
Q. Secretary Kerry said the other day that if you come to Scotland without legislation passed by Congressyour climate billthat would be as bad for credibility as when Trump pulled out of Paris. What do you make of that? That's what Secretary Kerry said.
The President. Well, I think it'd be good to have an agreement on the climate piece, but we're going to get the climate piece. And I think Senator Kerry has a little hyperbole there.
He pulled out. And the question is whether or not I have enough Republicans who understand the plan that's in jeopardy. And that's what we're working on.
Q. But what's your message to the union workers who are on strike across the country right now?
The President. I'm sorry?
Labor Issues 
Q. What's your message to the union workers striking across the country right now?
The President. My message is that they have a right to strike and they have a right to demand higher wages. And the companies they're striking on are doing very well. I'm not going to get into the negotiation, but my message is: If you think that's what you need, then you should do it.
Infrastructure, Jobs, Education, and Family Assistance Legislation 
Q. Mr. President, you expressed some uncertainty about the 2 years of free community college in your reconciliation package during your speech at the childcare center. Would you sign a package that doesn't include that proposal?
The President. Look[laughter]obviouslyare you married?
Q. I'm not.
The President. Okay. Well, you're going to have to learn how to negotiate better.
All kidding aside, look, it's clear that it's not going to be $3.5 trillion. So, the question is: How much of what is important do we get into the legislation? I'm of the view that it's important to establish the principle on a whole range of issues without guaranteeing you get the whole 10 years. It doesn'tit matters to establish it.
I don't know of any major change in American public policy that's occurred by a single piece of legislation. There probably is; I just can't think of one.
And so what happens is, you pass the principle and you build on it if in fact it either works or it doesn't work. And I'm convinced that's why I think you see so much support, even from the folks who are holding out, for the child tax credit.
Well, the childbut they didn't have that idea when I convinced them to pass it the first time when we did the act in JanuaryI mean, yes, February. But now people are seeing it. It's practical, it works, and it's fair.
And so, you know, I doubt whether we'll get the entire funding for community colleges, but I'm not going to give up on community colleges as long as I'm President.
Child Tax Credit Extension 
Q. What about just the child tax credit and all that childcare money that you talked about today? Do you have any sense of whether Senators Manchin and Sinema support putting that in the reconciliation package?
The President. Yes. Yes.
Q. Yes, they do? They both do?
The President. Yes, I have a sense.
Former President William J. Clinton 
Q. What did you say to President Clinton today? How did you guys
The President. Oh, I wanted to see how he was doing. Andbecause I've been trying to get a hold of him. He's doing fine; he really is. And he's going to be released from the hospital. And we talked aboutwhich we were going to do beforegetting togetherI haven't seen him in a whileand for him to come over and have some lunch and talk.
He was very encouraging about why he thought the policies I was pursuing made sense, but we didn't get into much detail, exceptit was mainly just to see how he's doing.
Q. Is he staying in the hospital, or is he getting out?
The President. I think he's not in any serious condition. He is getting out shortly, as I understand it. Whether that's tomorrow or the next day, I don't know.
Virginia Gubernatorial Race 
Q. Did you guys talk about McAuliffe's race, Terry McAuliffe's race in Virginia?
The President. No, we didn't talk about anythat I can think ofI don't think we talked about any particular race. I'm going to go in for the Governor.
Virginia and New Jersey Gubernatorial Races 
Q. Do you think McAuliffedo you think Terry McAuliffe's race is a foreshadowing for what the Democratshow the Democrats will fare in the midterm? Is that how you see it?
The President. No, look, I think everybody understandably reads the two gubernatorial off-year elections as being a bellwether of what may happen. Sometimes, it's been right; sometimes, it's been wrong. I think Terry is going to win. If he doesn't win, I don't know how much you read into that, but you know, Ibut, I think he'll win.
Federal Reserve System 
Q. Have you met recently with Lael Brainard or Chair Powell about the Fed Chair search?
The President. It's been nice talking to you. [Laughter]
Q. Senator Dodd has been a big supporter of Chairman Powell. I mean, did you talk to him about that today? Where are you?
The President. No, I didn't.
Q. No?
Infrastructure, Jobs, Education, and Family Assistance Legislation 
Q. Earlier, you said that, in regard to not getting the full $3.5 trillion, later you would go back for the rest.
The President. Sure.
Q. What exactly did you mean by that?

2021-10-15 00:00:00,"Remarks at the Dedication of the Dodd Center for Human Rights at the University of Connecticut in Storrs, Connecticut","
Thank you so very much. My name is Joe Biden. I am Jill Biden's husband. I'm delighted to be here. Thank you. Thank you.
It is trulyit's not hyperbole to suggestit's a great honor to be here, a genuine honor, andat this great public university celebrating the life and legacy of not one, but two proud sons of Connecticut: Senator Thomas Dodd and my good friendand we truly are really good, close friendsSenator Chris Dodd.
Chris and I have known each other for a long time. But if you'll excuse a point of personal privilege, as we used to say in the Senate, I saw up close how he fought for human rights and human dignity in the Senate.
Do you know my measure? Madam Ambassador, Ambassador Kennedy, do you know what my measure is? People who tell me they care about people and then disrespect the waitress or a waiter. People who tell me they care about how, in fact, people are entitled to be treated with dignity and walk by someone at a shoeshine stand and doesn't say ""hello."" People who do not do the just simply decent things for ordinary people. That's the real measure.
I've never seen Chris, figuratively orspeaking, walk by anybody. I've never seen him ignore his wife, ignore his two brilliant, beautiful daughters.
I remember the passion and eloquence that you brought to the floor, Chris, whether you were fighting for American families or serving as the Senate leaderleading voice on engagement with Latin America and the Caribbean. And your brother, the Ambassador, did a pretty damn good job as well.
I think that the work this Senator is doing to bring human rights to the forefront of public understanding is making a real and immediate impact for all young people today. I knowI think it's going to rate high among your family's many great and lasting contributions to the country, Chris. And I know this is truly a family commitment for the Dodds, so thank you for inviting me to be part of this. I think it's aI really mean it: It's an honor to be able to be here.
Of course, I owe Chris. I remember whenas he pointed out, when were both running for President back in 2007 with almost no cash in either of our campaigns[laughter]you let me hop a ride with you in a twin-engine prop plane[laughter]true storyfrom our Senate vote in DC to a Democratic debate in New Hampshire.
And we were on our way to the debate one other time, but the whole way up, we just laughed and told stories before we were debating one another. And then the next day, to get back to the Senate to vote, we had to flag down a youngremember this?flag down a young Senator named Barack Obama[laughter]to get to even open the airport. [Laughter] God's truth. Remember that, Chris? [Laughter] Here, he'd just been there 2 years. He was on my Foreign Relations CommitteeI was chairman. I said, ""Can you get the airport open for us?"" [Laughter]
I used toI'd kid Barack. I couldn't understand why he so soundly defeated me in that primary. [Laughter] And then I realized when he'd be introduced, he'd be introduced by the ""Voice of God."" I'd get introduced by ""Johnny Scanafrana."" [Laughter] So it took a while for me to figure all this out. [Laughter]
Luckily, Chris, I got to travel on a much nicer plane these days. [Laughter] And it's yours to travel on any time you would like.
I want to thank a few more proud Connecticut leaders who have been spending time with me today: Governor Lamont, you have beenyou're one of the finest Governors in the country. I'm not being solicitous; that's a fact. Exceeded only by your wife. [Laughter] And Senator Blumenthalwho I mentioned earlier todayI apologize for repeating this, but my son Beau Biden is the one who should be standing here talking to you. My son Beau Biden was the attorney general of the State of Delaware. And one of the people he went to and sought advice from, for real, was then-Attorney General Blumenthal. They became friends. And my son was a great admirer. And I think the Senator knows that.
And Senator Murphyif I have to have someone in the foxhole with me, I want Murph with me, man. [Laughter] No, I'm serious. This guy knows as much about foreign policy as anybody does, and his failure to remain silent has meant a great deal to me, because he's spoken up on so much.
And, Representative Courtney, I thank you. Thank you for your help and your support. And Rosa DeLauro. RosaI don't owe as much as Chris does to Rosa, but I owe a hell of a lot to her. My son was married, and it was his second year of law school, and he transferred to Yale Law School. And Rosa heard that I was coming up with him.
And the apartment he rented was less than ideal[laughter]and the whole thing had to be painted. My brother Jimmy fixes everythingmy brother Jimmy was with us, and we went down and bought about 28 gallons of paint. I don't know howbut, for real, it was hot as hell as well.
And I'm up on aon an 8-foot ladder, painting the crown molding and sweating like the proverbial you-know-what. And I hear
[At this point, the President knocked on the podium.]
at the door. I said, ""Come in."" And the then-aldermanis it alderman or councilman at the time? Alderman. Alderman DeLauro walked inher mom.
And she said, ""Where's Biden?"" [Laughter] And I said, ""I'm here."" She said: ""No, stop fooling with me, son. Where's Biden?"" I said: ""No, no, I'm Biden. I'm Biden."" And she cameshe says, ""I just wanted to come over and introduce myself and tell your son I'll be taking care of him."" And in walks the chief of police. [Laughter] I thought, ""Holy God, what did I do?"" [Laughter] She says: ""You're going to have nothing to worry about. You have nothing to worry about."" Talk about constituent serviceRosa, you come by it honestly.
And, Rosa, we've alland I'm not being solicitousagain, I'm using that word twice nowwe've all learned a great deal from you. I want to thank you for your longstanding dedication to therelating to the well-being of children and families, and for championing and expanding the child tax credit, which is a gigantic middle class tax cut for working families that finally got passed in the American Rescue Plan, which we were able to get done immediately upon being elected.
And Rosa will not tell you, but she's the first person I called to ask for her help as to how I should do this. And that put money in the pockets of families all across this country, even as we speak. It's how we're going to cut child poverty in this country. And we've already cut it innearly in half. And none of us should lose sight of what it meant to American families when we think about our mission to defend human rights and dignity at home and around the world.
Twenty-six years ago today, another United States Senatora United States Presidentwho I just spoke to, Chris, literally an hour and a half agoBill Clintonand he sends his best, by the wayvisited this university to dedicate the Thomas J. Dodd Research Centera library and archives of papers that amount to an incredible first-person first draft of history.
And let me say that we're all thinking about President Clinton today and sending him his good wishes to a speedy recovery. And he's always been the ""Comeback Kid."" He's getting out of the hospital. Everything is going well. But he wanted to send his best.
As a young lawyer, Tom Dodd had already built a record of fighting hatred by prosecuting the KKK in the South, butwhen, in 1945, he left behind his beloved Grace and his five young childrena young Christopher just 14 months old at the timeto travel to the bombed-out cities of Europe to document the shocking atrocities, still fresh in their horror; to question and cross-examine some of history's most notorious villainsand that's not hyperbole; some of history's most notorious villainsand to expose beyond question the depravity and the crimes against humanity that the Nazi regime committed.
Tom Dodd dedicated his intellect and his moral passion and his resolute sense of right and wrong to making the Nuremberg war crimes tribunal a testament to justice. And that's what it was: a testament to justice. Nothing like it ever happened before.
And all the while, he was writing letters to his Grace, lamenting their separation but recognizing the momentous weight of history that rested on his shoulders. And, Chris, I came upthe same sentence from your book: ""Someday,"" he wrote, ""will be recognized as a great landmark in the struggle of mankind for peace. . . . Never before has such a record been written and men will read it for a thousand years in amazement and wonder . . . how it [ever] happened.""
When President Clinton spoke at this first dedication, he ended on a pointed reminder. He said, and I quote, ""The road to tyranny, we must never forget, begins with the destruction of . . . truth."" The road to tyranny begins with the destruction of truth.
In my view, that was the lesson at the heart of the Nuremberg trials: finding truth, documenting it so it could never be denied. In court, Tom Dodd built the case fact-by-fact, using the Nazis' own meticulous records of crimes and shocking human evidence to pin down Nazi leaders who tried to deny their complicity and feign ignorance.
And even more important, it denied the entire German policy [population]* the ability to feign ignorance. To deal with the past, you must face the truth, whether it was Dachau or Buchenwald, Auschwitz, or other camps. Millions of Jews rounded up, along with members of other minority groups, and thrown into camps, abused, used as forced labor, medical experimentation. Six million Jews murdered, including so many who met their ultimate fate in the gas chamber.
He made sure no one could deny their own eyes and what they saw. He preserved the truth, ugly and as traumatic as it was, for all of history so that the horrors of the Holocaust could never be diminished or denied. An evil that we still have to guard against to this day has to be watched.
Chris, as you heard me say many times beforebecause you got to meet my dadmy dad was a well-read, high school-educated fellow whose greatest regret was he never went to college. But he cared deeply about human dignity.
Our dinner tablemy dad was what many would call a ""righteous Christian."" He happened to be a Catholic, but he was a righteous Christian. And growing up, my dad would come home for dinner before he went back to close the business he managed. And the dinner table was a place where we sat down to have conversation and, incidentally, eat. [Laughter] I'm serious.
My dad used to talk about, as a student of the Holocaust, what a tragedy it was we didn't bomb the railroad tracks toward the end of the war; how wrong it was that we turned away the St. Louis, a ship full of Jewish refugees from Europe.
He believed passionately the only way we could make real the promise of ""never again"" was to keep reminding ourselves of what had happened and how so many peopleotherwise thought themselves decent peoplerationalized that it really wasn't happening""we didn't know what was going on""because they weren't turning on the gas valve, they had no responsibility.
That's why, if you'll again excuse a point of personal privilege, when each of my childrenand now my grandchildrenturned the age of 15, the first thing I've donemy word as a Bidenis put them on an aircraft and fly to Dachau, one at a time, at age 15. ""Work sets you free""as you go through the entrance.
But that's not what I wanted them to see. I wanted them to see the lovely homes that were right up against the fence line with their beautiful roofs. People living in there rationalized that: ""It's not me. I'm not doing this. And I don't know, really, what's going on in there."" I wanted them to see the ability of the human mind to rationalize cannot be underestimated.
I would say, parenthetically, the reason why Germany has been able to turn it around, unlike other countries, is because they faced it head on, acknowledged. So let me say it again: Nuremberg was unlike anything that ever came before. It was not about vengeance. It was about accountability. For only acknowledging the truth can we prevent the repetition of atrocities, which are happening now in other parts of the world.
It elevated our conception, as Chris said, of the rule of law. It set a marker for the future of justice, uplifted the importance of human rights in international affairs. We see it in the Nuremberg tribunalsthe blueprint we see in those tribunalsthe blueprint for future United Nations tribunals that would help deliver justice after atrocities committed in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia.
We see it in the values championed at Nuremberg and the antecedents of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the foundation of a rules-based international order built out of the wreckage of two warsworld warsnot just to prevent us from destroying ourselves, but to actively build a better future.
We see it in the passion of a young prosecutor, the commitment to prioritizing the human impacts of policies, the commitment carried through in his son's career of public service and by all the students of this institute who've been inspired by the example. We need you. We need you badly. And as we look around the world today, we see human rights and democratic principles increasingly under assault. We feel the same charge of history upon our own shoulders to act.
We have fewer democracies in the world today than we did 15 years ago. Fewer. Not morefewer. Cannot be sustained. That's why, from day one of my administration, I've taken concrete steps to put human rights back at the center of our foreign policy and reassert our moral leadership on the global stage; to lead, as Chris has so often heard me say, with the power of our example, not the example of our power.
When Chris and I served on the Foreign Relations Committee, we excoriated the abuses elsewhere in the world and called for action overseas. But human rights, in some ways, stood apart from the domestic struggle of civil rights and civil liberties and equal justice here at home. Today, we know that our efforts to defend human rights around the world are stronger because we recognize our own historic challenges as part of that same fight.
Leading by example means taking action at home to renew and defend our own democracy; to advance equity and promote justice; to defend the sacred right to vote in free, fair, and secure elections. Leading by example means not pretending that our history has been perfect, but demonstrating how strong nations speak honestly about the past and uphold the truth and strive to improve.
We make the best case for gender equality, racial justice and equity, religious freedom, the rights of the LGBTQ+ peoples and other marginalized communities around the world by practicing what we preach. The first 10 minutes I was in office I ended the Muslim ban; advancing racial equity throughout the Federal Government; overturning the ban on transgender individuals serving openly in the United States military; establishing the White House Gender Policy Council.
Demonstrating that our commitment to human rights begins at home is among the most powerful and persuasive tools in our foreign policy kit. And as we defend human rights beyond our shores, we're more effective when we work together, allies and partners in our shared values.
America, as a nation, is unique in all history, not because we're inherently better, because the basis upon which we're organized. Virtually every other nation is organized based on ethnicity, religion, geography, color. We're unique in all the world. We're based on one guiding principle: We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men and women are created equal, endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, including life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
We have never lived up to it. We've never, until very recently, walked away from it. The arc has always bent closer and closer to justice and inclusion. The moment we stop, the moment we rest is the moment that our influence diminishes. So we're reengaging multilaterally and rallying the world to advance universal human rights and fundamental freedoms to prove that democracies can still deliver in an age of fast-moving, cross-cutting challenges.
We have rejoined the U.N. Human Rights Council, which we walked away fromthe United States of America, last time, didn't want to be part. I mean, just yesterday we won an election to a new 3-year term that begins in January on that committee. We had to fight to get back on it because the world wondered, ""Do we mean it still?"" The United States of Americado we mean it?
In December, I will hostthe United States will host a virtual summita Summit of Democraciesto bring together world leaders to make concrete commitments to defend democratic values and push back against advancing authoritarianism, not war, but important words. We can't return to a world where might is right and strong nations abuse weak or oppress individual rights with impunity.
Nuremberg forced us to look closely at the evil of humankind and what we're capable of perpetrating, to see mass atrocities, crimes against humanity do not happen by accident. They don't happen by accident. They result of choices, choices made by individual human beings and world leaders.
And sadly, when we look around the world today, we cannot say that the specter of atrocity is behind us. We see today the patterns, the choices playing out around the world even as we speak: the oppression and use of forced labor of the Uyghurs in Xinjiang; the treatment of the Rohingya by the military junta in Burma; the rampant abuses, including the use of starvation and sexual violence, to terrorize civilian populations in Northern Ethiopia.
Whenever we hear that kind of poisonous hatred, wherever we see our fellow humans being dehumanized, it doesn't mean we go to war, but we must speak out. Silenceas my dad would remind mesilence is complicity. Silence is complicity. That's what Nuremberg said: Your silence is complicity.
I've raised these issues personally with leaders around the worldour friends and our adversaries alikeand I've made it clear that no U.S. President should stand by when human rights are under attack and maintain their legitimacy.
Those who we arethat's who we are as Americans. It's part of our DNA. We've fought, we've marched, we've sacrificed to ensure that rights are not reserved to just the wealthy or the powerful. They're the God-given inheritance of every person on this planet by virtue of our shared humanity.
As I said to a Supreme Court Justice who I disagreed with in a hearingwe have a differentyou think I have my rights because the Constitution granted them to me. I possess my rights because I was born, and I gave up some of my rights in a constitution.
That's the radical idea at the core of the founding of our Nation, as I said, that all women and men are created equal, that we are all endowed by our creator with certain unalienable rights. And those rights don't flow from the power of the Government; these rights exist for every individual. Period. Period. It is the job of the Government to protect them and to uphold them equally for all people.
We have never, as I said, fully lived up to that animating American ideal, but we've never turned our backs on it. In all the years since our founding, that idea has been our Nation's steady North Star, drawing us back on course. That constant struggle to live up to our highest domesticdemocratic principles to self-correct has made us a beacon of hope for the rest of the world. It's also made us strong, resilient, innovative, dynamic.
As I saidand I'll repeat; I apologizeAmerica is the only nation founded on an idea, the single most powerful idea in human history. It sparked our revolution. It helped ignite the wave of change around the world that successive generations have built on, expanding our understanding and extending protections to an ever-wider circle.
But we must never forget just how fragile the principle of universal human rights still is: how easily bruised, how often sacrificed in human battles for power and personal enrichment. In an age of increasing misinformation and disinformation, mustwe must not grow complacent in our defense of the democratic values that have been the firm foundation for an era of peace and prosperity unprecedentedunprecedentedin human history.
Attacks on truth are still the harbinger of tyranny. Nothing about our democracy is assured, as I'm sure you've all begun to realize of late. Nothing about our freedom is guaranteed. We have to work for it. In those letters from Tom Dodd to his dear wife Grace reflecting his service at Nuremberg, he wrote: ""Sometimes, a man knows his duty so clearly, so surely, he cannot hesitate and he dare not refuse it.""
Tom Dodd lived a life with a clarity of purpose. He brought it to his service as U.S. Senator, leading the floor fights, with the Kennedys, on civil rights legislation in the sixties; advocating for gun safety in a State that was a major gun manufacturer, legislation that was ahead of its time; fighting always for human rights and democracy against the forces of oppression and injustice.
He passed that passion on to his childrenand to his son Chris. Chris forwardcarried forward his father's mantle in the United States Senate. He used it to fight for all American children and families, passing the first childcare act we've seen in this country since World War II, passing the Family and Medical Leave Act.
Chris railed against policies that militarized our relationships in Latin America and argued to instead recognize and invest in the people of our hemisphere. He spoke out when he saw the legacy of justice that his father had fought for in Nuremberg being wrapped in the excesses of a ""war on terror.""
And he helped to create this center, growing it over the years from an archival repository for the truth into a leading center for the study and promotion of human rights at home and abroad; into a widely respected academic institution, training the next generation of human rights defenders and passing the torch to those of you who will carry the fight on into the future and thefor the truth.
So, as we rededicate the Dodd Center for Human Rights to honor the legacies of both father and son, let's also dedicate it to the future of generations, to the students here in the audience today who will discover and defend human rights as the passion and purpose of our life.
So let us dedicatebe dedicated to expanding our shared understanding that we can never fully realize the freedom we wish for ourselves without also helping ensure that liberty and justice for everyone. And let's dedicatelet's dedicateit to the unending fight to bring our own Nation, our own world closer to a future in which every human being is free to pursue the highest dreams and unleash their full potential.
And for you students that are hereundergraduates at this great institutionthere's no reason why you will not be doing what I'm doing as President of the United States, standing here, speaking to audiences now. I mean that from the bottom of my heart. I was taughtI came from very modest means; no Horatio Alger story, but very modest meansthat you can be anything you set your mind to if you work at it.
So many of you in this audience, especially on the second tier there, are the people that my grandchildren are going to be looking to. There's not a single reason whynot a single reason why we can't do this. Not a single reason.
As I've told every world leader that I've gotten to knowand I've met many, many of themit's never been a good bet to bet against the American people.
God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you.

The President. Hello, everybody. Can you all hear me?
Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Deanne Bennett Criswell. We can, Mr. President.
The President. Well
Administrator Criswell. Can you hear me?
The President. I can hear you clearly.
Let me begin by thanking you all, every one of you, for the incredible work you're doing. You know, and I want to thank you for joining me on this call today. And I know so many of you have been working flat out, nights and weekends, for a long time now.
Hurricane Ida is coming fast on the heels of a tragic flooding in Tennessee, Tropical Storm Henri, and you've all been part of a COVID-19 response for so many months now. You've been overwhelmed, but you don't show it. You've been incredible. Thank you.
You know, Ida is turning into a very, very dangerous storm; I need not tell you. I just got another briefing from the Hurricane Center and, as you know, it's now heading straight forright toward Louisiana.
This weekend is the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. And it's a stark reminder that we have to do everything we can to prepare the people in the region and make sure we're ready to respond.
Administrator Criswell, you and I have spoken extensively about this. We were together yesterday, and we spoke to the Governors of Louisiana, of Alabama, and Mississippi to ask what they need from us before the storm arrived. And I've already signed an emergency declaration for Louisiana to make sure we're ready for the surge response capability to deal with whatever comes ourtheir wayour way, but it's their way.
You know, we've deployed 500 FEMA emergency response personnel in Texas and Louisiana, in addition to 2,000 FEMA personnel already supporting our COVID response in the region. And we've prepositioned food, water, generators, and other supplies in the area. Power restoration and mobile communication support teams are also en route. We've also closely coordinated with the electric utilities to restore power as soon as possible and to support your response and recovery efforts.
And above all, I'm urging the people of the area to pay attention and be prepared. I want to say it again: to pay attention and be prepared. Have supplies for your household on hand. Follow the guidance from local authorities. And if you have to move to shelter, make sure you wear a mask and try to keep some distance because we're still facing the highly contagious Delta variant as well.
Administration CriswellAdministrator Criswell, you're, you knowI'm going to turn this over to you in a moment here to give an update on the latest steps we're taking. And I want you to know what more canI need to know everything you think we need to be able to do. If you haven't gotten the authority for it, tell me now. We'll get it done. It's likemost importantly, I just want to say to all of you: Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Everything you're doing to prepare for this dangerous storm is going to mitigate the impact of potential natural disasters, results that are going to be visited on so many people in the region. The work you're doing is vital, and you all know it.
So, Administrator Criswell, let's you and I have a conversation. Tell me what you need and what's going on.

2021-08-27 00:00:00,Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Prime Minister Naftali Bennett of Israel,"
President Biden. Welcome, folks. It's a delight to have the Prime Minister here. I know there's going to bewe're going to talk about our relationship, which is as strong as can be. But I know you're going to want to know what's happened this morning in terms of my meetings with ourmy national security team.
Terrorist Attack at the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan, on August 26 
Let me begin by once again acknowledging the bravery and the sacrifice that our military makes every single day. And the loss of those Americans and marines and sailor and Army personnel is tragic.
As I said yesterday, and the Prime Minister and I talked about it slightlyhe's a military man; gone to war, lost a friendyou know, losing a son, a daughter, a husband, a wife, is like being sucked into a big black hole in the middle of your chest, and you don't think there's any way outyou wonder what's happening. So my heart goes outour hearts go outto all those who we've lost.
But look, the mission there being performed is dangerous, and it is nowit's come with a significant loss of American personnel. Andbut it's a worthy mission because they continue to evacuate folks out of that region, out of the airport. We've evacuated more than 12,000 additional people out of the airport in the last 24 hours.
I met with my commanders this morning, first thing in the morning. I got a detailed briefing about yesterday's attacks and the measures they're taking to protect our forces and complete the mission. And we will complete the mission.
Now, I'm not going to take any questions, because of the Prime Minister being here, on Afghanistan now, but I'll be available at another time.
The President's Meeting With Prime Minister Naftali Bennett of Israel 
But it's great to have the Prime Minister here. Wehewe've become close friends. He's ridden the Amtrak train a lot[laughter]from New York down to Wilmington, DelawareI told you we have a few corporations in Delawareback in the days when he was in private practice.
Andbut he heads and leads the most diverse government in Israeli history. And we've got a big agenda today, starting with COVIDwhich we've been talking aboutand19and both our successful vaccination programs.
And we've talked a little bitand we're going to continue to talkabout the issue of booster shots. And theyyou started your program a little early. It's been met with great results. And we're going to start mid-September, but we're considering the advice you've given that we should start earlier.
And this is promising alsothis booster program is going to start here on September the 20th, pending approval of the FDA and then a CDC committee of outside experts. And the question raised is: Should it be shorter than 8 months? Should it be as little as 5 months? And that's being discussed. I spoke with Dr. Fauci this morning about that.
We're also going to discuss Israel's unwaveringunwavering commitment that we have in the United States to Israel's security. And I fully, fully, fully support replenishing Israel's Iron Dome system.
And we also are going to discuss the threat from Iran and our commitment to ensure Iran never develops a nuclear weapon. Andbut we're putting diplomacy first and seeing where that takes us.
But if diplomacy fails, we're ready to turn to other options. We'll support Israel's developing deeper ties, as well, with the Arab and Muslim neighbors and globally. That's a trend that I think should be encouraged and not discouraged. And we're going to do all we can to be value added.
We also are going to discuss ways to advance peace and security and prosperity for Israelis and Palestinians. And we're also going to direct our teams to work toward Israel fulfilling the requirements of the visa waiver program and get that done.
So, Mr. Prime Minister, I want to thank you again for coming. The U.S. will always be there for Israel. It's an unshakeable partnership between our two nations. And I've known every Israeli Prime Minister since Golda Meir and gotten to know them fairly well. And I look forward to us establishing a strong, personal relationship.
So, welcome. Welcome.
Prime Minister Bennett. Thank you, Mr. President. First of all, on behalf of the Israeli people, I want to extend our condolences and deep sadness for the loss of American lives in Kabul. The American servicemembers lost their lives while on a mission to save other people's lives, and that's the very definition of courage and sacrifice. May they rest in peace. Especially on this day, I want to be crystal clear: Israel always stands together with the United States of America unequivocally.
I also want to thank you for your warm words now and in our private meeting, which attests to your support of the State of Israel. But that's not new; it's been decades. And you've always stood up for us, especially during tough times, like a few months ago when thousands of rockets were being shot on Israeli towns and cities. And that's when friendship is really tested. We trust in your support, Mr. President. And Israel knows that we have no better or more reliable ally in the world than the United States of America.
I come here from Jerusalem, our eternal capital. And I bring with me a new spirit, a spirit of good will, a spirit of hope, a spirit of decency and honesty, a spirit of unity and bipartisanship of folks who, as you suggested, harbor very different political opinions, even opposing. Yet we all share the deep passion to work together to build a better future for Israel. And that's what Israel is about.
We're out to be good, to do good. But in our region, doing good is not enough. Israel has to be strong in order to do good. Be strong so we can do good.
And we cannot lose sight for even one moment that we're in the toughest neighborhood in the world. We've got ISIS on our southern border, Hizballah on our northern border, Islamic Jihad, Hamas, Iranian militias that surround us. And all of them want to killkill us, kill Israelis. They all want to annihilate the Jewish state. And that's why Israel always has to be overwhelming strongoverwhelmingly stronger than any of our enemies and, indeed, of all our enemies combined.
And that's why I want to thank you, Mr. President, for helping, yet again, to fortify Israel's strategic advantage.
Obviously, the main issue we're going to be talking about today here is Iran's race to a nuclear weapon. We talked about it inside the room, and I was happy to hear your clear words that Iran will never be able to acquire a nuclear weapon and that you emphasized that you'll try the diplomatic route, but there's other options if that doesn't work out.
So, you know, these very days illustrate what the world would look like. If a radical Islamic regime acquired a nuclear weapon, that marriage would be a nuclear nightmare for the entire world. Iran is the world's number-one exporter of terror, instability, and human right violations. And as we sit here right now, the Iranians are spinning their centrifuges in Natanz and Fordow, but we've got to stop it. And we both agree.
So we've developed a comprehensive strategy that we're going to be talking about with two goals: The first goal is to stop Iran on its regional aggression and start rolling it back into the box; and the second is to permanently keep Iran away from ever being able to break out to a nuclear weapon.
As I told you, Mr. President, Israel never had and never will ask America to send troops to defend ourselves. That's our job. We will never outsource our security. It's our responsibility to take care of our fate. But we do thank you for the tools and the back you've been giving us and you're giving us.
As you said, we're also going to be talking about COVID and the Delta variant, which is wreaking havoc across the world. You were the first to call the pandemic ""the pandemic of the unvaccinated,"" and that iscould not be more true.
Just about a month ago, I took a very tough decision, a policy decision, that Israel would pioneer the booster shot, the third shot. I can report to you, Mr. President, and to everyone, that we've reached almost 3 million Israelis that have received the booster shot. And the bottom line is, it's safe, and it works. The good news, finally, is that the tide is turning in Israel.
And one last word, Mr. PresidentI'll take this off for this part, if I may: You're a man of faith, as am I. In the synagogues across the world, we read a biblical portion; beyond the Parsha, it's called the Haftarah. And tomorrow we're going to be reading words of the prophet IsaiahYesha'yahu. In Hebrew, the words are
[At this point, Prime Minister Bennett spoke in Hebrew. He then resumed his remarks in English as follows.]
What this meansI can say anything now. Right? [Laughter] What this means is, the sons and daughters of the Jewish people are going to come back to our land, are going to nurse our ancient land and rebuild it. And this ancient Jewish prophecy is today's Israel reality. And Iit's a miracle that you've been so central and so part of it for so many years.
So, Mr. President, today, you and Iand you've been so generous with your time in these difficult daysyou and I are going to write yet another chapter in the beautiful story of the friendship between our two nations, the United States of America and the Jewish and democratic State of Israel, both of us who seek to do good and need to be strong, both of us who are a lighthouse in a very, very stormy world.
Thank you, Mr. President. I look forward to working with you now and for many years forward. Thank you.
President Biden. Well, thank you. And you give me credit, much of which should go to Barack Obama, for making sure that we committed to a qualitative edge you would have relative to your friends in the region. So he's the one that deserves the credit.
Prime Minister Bennett. Thank him as well.
President Biden. Thank you very much, folks.

2021-08-26 00:00:00,"Remarks on the Terrorist Attack at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan, and an Exchange With Reporters","
The President. It's been a tough day. This evening in Kabul, as you all know, terrorists attackedthat we've been talking about and worried about, that the intelligence community has assessed has [was]* undertakenan attackby a group known as ISIS-Ktook the lives of American servicemembers standing guard at the airport, and wounded several others seriously. They also wounded a number of civilians, and civilians were killed as well.
I've been engaged all day and in constant contact with the military commanders here in Washington, the Pentagon, as well as in Afghanistan and Doha. And my commanders here in Washington and in the field have been on this with great detail, and you've had a chance to speak to some, so far. The situation on the ground is still evolving, and I'm constantly being updated.
These American servicemembers who gave their livesit's an overused word, but it's totally appropriate herewere heroes. Heroes who have been engaged in a dangerous, selfless mission to save the lives of others. They were part of an airlift, an evacuation effort unlike any seen in history, with more than 100,000 American citizens, American partners, Afghans who helped us, and others taken to safety in the last 11 days. Just in the last 12 hours or so, another 7,000 have gotten out.
They were part of the bravest, most capable, and the most selfless military on the face of the Earth. And they were part of, simply, what I call the ""backbone of America."" They're the spine of America, the best the country has to offer.
Jill and Iour hearts ache, like I'm sure all of you do as well, for all those Afghan families who have lost loved ones, including small children, or been wounded in this vicious attack. And we're outraged as well as heartbroken.
Being the father of an Army major who served for a year in Iraq and, before that, was in Kosovo as a U.S. attorney for the better part of 6 months in the middle of a warwhen he came home after a year in Iraq, he was diagnosed, like many, many coming home, with an aggressive and lethal cancer of the brainwho we lost.
We have some sense, like many of you do, of what the families of these brave heroes are feeling today. You get this feeling like you're being sucked into a black hole in the middle of your chest; there's no way out. My heart aches for you. But I know this: We have a continuing obligation, a sacred obligation to all of you, the families of those heroes. That obligation is not temporary; it lasts forever.
The lives we lost today were lives given in the service of liberty, the service of security, in the service of others, in the service of America. Like their fellow brothers-and-sisters-in-arms who died defending our vision and our values in the struggle against terrorism ofthe fallen this day, they're part of a great and noble company of American heroes.
To those who carried out this attack, as well as anyone who wishes America harm, know this: We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay. I will defend our interests and our people with every measure at my command.
Over the past few weeksI know you'remany of you are probably tired of hearing me say itwe've been made aware by our intelligence community that the ISIS-Kan archenemy of the Taliban; people who were freed when both those prisons were openedhas been planning a complex set of attacks on the United States personnel and others.
This is why, from the outset, I've repeatedly said this mission was extraordinarily dangerous and why I have been so determined to limit the duration of this mission. And as General McKenzie said, this is why our mission was designedthis is the way it was designed to operate: operate under severe stress and attack. We've known that from the beginning.
And as I've been in constant contact with our senior military leadersand I mean constant, around the clockand our commanders on the ground and throughout the day, they made it clear that we can and we must complete this mission, and we will. And that's what I've ordered them to do. We will not be deterred by terrorists. We will not let them stop our mission. We will continue the evacuation.
I've also ordered my commanders to develop operational plans to strike ISIS-K assets, leadership, and facilities. We will respond with force and precision at our time, at the place we choose, and the moment of our choosing.
Here is what you need to know: These ISIS terrorists will not win. We will rescue the Americans who are there. We will get out our Afghan allies out, and our mission will go on. America will not be intimidated. And I have the utmost confidence in our brave service members who continue to execute this mission with courage and honor to save lives and get Americans, our partners, our Afghan allies out of Afghanistan.
Every day when I talk to our commanders, I ask them what they need, what more do they need, if anything, to get the job done. As they will tell you, I granted every request. I reiterated to them again today, on three occasions, that they should take the maximum steps necessary to protect our forces on the ground in Kabul.
And I also want to thank the Secretary of Defense and the military leadership at the Pentagon and all the commanders in the field. There has been complete unanimity from every commander on the objectives of this mission and the best way to achieve those objectives.
Those who have served through the ages have drawn inspiration from the Book of Isaiah, when the Lord says, ""Whom shall I send . . . who shall go for us?"" And the American military has been answering for a long time: ""Here am I, Lord. Send me."" Here I am. Send me.
Each one of these women and men of our Armed Forces are the heirs of that tradition of sacrifice of volunteering to go into harm's way, to risk everything, not for glory, not for profit, but to defend what we love and the people we love.
And I ask that you join me now in a moment of silence for all those in uniform and out of uniformmilitary and civilianwho have given the last full measure of devotion.
[At this point, the President observed a moment of silence.]
Thank you, may God bless you all, and may God protect those troops and all those standing watch for America. We have so much to do. It's within our capacity to do it. We just have to remain steadfast. Steadfast.
We will complete our mission. And we will continue, after our troops have withdrawn, to find means by which we defined any American who wishes to get out of Afghanistan. We will find them, and we will get them out.
Ladies and gentlemen, they gave me a list here. The first person I was instructed to call on was Kelly O'Donnell of NBC.
Withdrawal of U.S. Military Forces From Afghanistan/Potential Additional U.S. Military Support/U.S. Counterterrorism Efforts 
Q. Mr. President, you have said leaving Afghanistan is in the national interest of the United States. After today's attack, do you believe you will authorize additional forces to respond to that attack inside Afghanistan? And are youare you prepared to add additional forces to protect those Americans who remain on the ground carrying out the evacuation operation?
The President. I've instructed the military, whatever they needif they need additional forceI will grant it. But the militaryfrom the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the Joint Chiefs, the commanders in the fieldhave all contacted me one way or another, usually by letter, saying they subscribe to the mission as designed to get as many people out as we can within the timeframe that is allotted. That is the best way, they believe, to get as many Americans out as possible, and others.
And with regard to finding, tracking down the ISIS leaders who ordered this, we have some reason to believe we know who they arenot certainand we will find ways of our choosing, without large military operations, to get them.
Q. Inside Afghanistan, Mr. President?
The President. Wherever they are.
Trevor [Trevor Hunnicutt, Reuters] from Reuters.
Taliban/Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. There has been some criticism, even from people in your party, about the dependence on the Taliban to secure the perimeter of the airport. Do you feel like there was a mistake made in that regard?
The President. No, I don't. Look, I think General McKenzie handled this question very well. The fact is that we're in a situationwe inherited a situation, particularly since, as we all know, that the Afghan military collapsed 11 days beforein 11 daysthat it is in the interest of, as Mackenzie said, in the interest of the Taliban that, in fact, ISIS-K does not metastasize beyond what it is, number one. And number two, it's in their interest that we are able to leave on time, on target.
As a consequence of that, the major things we've asked themmoving back the perimeter; giving more space between the wall; stopping vehicles from coming through, et cetera; searching people coming throughit is not what you'd call a tightly commanded, regimented operation like the U.S. isthe military isbut they're acting in their interesttheir interest.
And so, by and largeand I've asked this same question to military on the ground, whether or not it's a useful exercise. No one trusts them; we're just counting on their self-interest to continue to generate their activities. And it's in their self-interest that we leave when we said and that we get as many people out as we can.
And like I said, even in the midst of everything that happened today, over 7,000 people have gotten out, over 5,000 Americans overall.
So it's not a matter of trust, it's a matter of mutual self-interest. Andbut there is no evidence thus far that I've been given, as a consequence, by any of our commanders in the field, that there has been collusion between the Taliban and ISIS in carrying out what happened today both in front of the hotel and what is expected to continue forbeyond today.
Aamer [Aamer Madhani], Associated Press.
Withdrawal of U.S. Military Forces From Afghanistan/Evacuation of U.S. Citizens and Afghan Allies From Afghanistan/Taliban 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You have spoken again powerfully about your own son and the weight of these decisions. With that in mindand also what you've said: that the longer we stay, the more likelihood that there would be a major attackhow do you weigh staying even 1 more day, considering what's happened?
The President. Because I think what America says matters. What we say we're going to do and the context in which we say we're going to do it, that we do it, unless something exceptional changes.
There are additional American citizens, there are additional green card holders, there are additional personnel of our allies, there are additional SIV card holders, there are additional Afghans that have helped us, and there are additional groups of individuals that have contacted us from women's groups, to NGOs, and others, who have expressly indicated they want to get out and have gathered in certain circumstances in groups, on buses and other means, that still presents the opportunity for the next several days, between now and the 31st, to be able to get them out.
And our militaryand, I believe, to the extent that we can do that knowing the threat, knowing that we may very well have another attackthe military has concluded that's what we should do. I think they're right. I think they're correct.
And after that, we're going to be in a circumstance where there arewill be, I believe, numerous opportunities to continue to provide access for additional persons to get out of Afghanistan, either through means that we provide and/or are provided through cooperation with the Taliban.
They're not good guys, the Taliban. I'm not suggesting that at all. But they have a keen interest. As many of you have been reporting, they very much would like to figure out how to keep the airport open. They don't have the capacity to do it. They very much are trying to figure out whether or not they can maintain what is the portion of an economy that has become not robust, but fundamentally different than it had been.
And so there's a lot of reasons why they have reached out not just to us, but to others, as to why it would be continued in their interest to get more of the personnel we want to get out. We can locate them.
Now, there's not many left that we can assess that arewant to come out. There's some Americans we've identifiedwe've contacted the vast majority of them, if not all of themwho don't want to leave because they havethey're dual nationals, they have extended families, et cetera. And there's others who are looking for the time. So that's why we continue.
I'll take a few more questions, andbut, you, sir.
Evacuation of U.S. Citizens and Afghan Allies From Afghanistan 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President.
The President. I didn't pick you, but that's okay. [Laughter]
Q. I wanted to ask youyou say that ""what America says matters."" What do you say to the Afghans who helped troops, who may not be able to get out by August 31? What
The President. I say
Q. What do you say to them?
The President. we're going to continue to try to get you out. It matters.
Look, I know of no conflict, as a student of historyno conflict where, when a war was ending, one side was able to guarantee that everyone that wanted to be extracted from that country would get out.
And think about it, folks. I think it's important forI know the American people get this in their gut. There are, I would argue, millions of Afghani citizens who are not Taliban; who did not actively cooperate with us as SIVs; who, if given a chance, they'd be onboard a plane tomorrow. It sounds ridiculous, but the vast majority of people in communities like that want to come to America, given a choice.
So, getting every single person out iscan't be guaranteed to anybody because there's a determination, all who wants to get out as well.
At any rate, it's a process.
I was really pointing to you, butyou, sir.
Taliban/Evacuation of U.S. Citizens and Afghan Allies From Afghanistan 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. There are reports that U.S. officials provided the Taliban with names of Americans and Afghan officials to evacuate. Were you aware of that? Did that happen?
And then, sir, did you personally reject a recommendation to hold or to recapture Bagram Air Force Base?
The President. Here's what I've done on theask thisI'll answer the last question, first. On the tactical questions of how to conduct an evacuation or a war, I gather up all the major military personnel that are in Afghanistan, the commanders, as well as the Pentagon. And I ask for their best military judgment: what would be the most efficient way to accomplish the mission.
They concludedthe militarythat Bagram was not much value added, that it was much wiser to focus on Kabul. And so I followed that recommendation.
With regard tothere are certain circumstances where we've gotten informationand quite frankly, sometimes from some of yousaying, ""You know of such and such a group of people who are trying to get out, and they're on a bus, they're moving""from other people""and this is their location.""
And there have been occasions when our military has contacted their military counterparts in the Taliban and said, ""This""for example: ""This bus is coming through with x number of people on it, made up of the following group of people. We want you to let that bus or that group through."" So yes, there have been occasions like that.
And to the best of my knowledge, in those cases, the bulk of that has occurred; they've been let through. But I can't tell you with any certitude that there's actually been a list of names. I don'tthere may have been, but I know of no circumstance. It doesn't mean it's notit didn't exist, that: ""Here's the names of 12 people; they're coming. Let them through."" It could very well have happened.
I'll take one more question.
Q. Mr. President, can I
Q. Mr. President, right here. Mr. President
The President. Whoa. Wait, wait, wait. Let me take the one question from the most interesting guy that I know in the press.
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Is thatis therethank you.
The President. That's you. [Laughter]
Taliban/Terrorist Attack at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan 
Q. Mr. President, there had not been a U.S. servicemember killed in combat in Afghanistan since February of 2020. You set a deadline. You pulled troops out. You sent troops back in. And now 12 marines are dead. You said the buck stops with you. Do you bear any responsibility for the way that things have unfolded in the last two weeks?
The President. I bear responsibility for, fundamentally, all that's happened of late.
But here's the deal: You knowI wish you'd one day say these thingsyou know as well as I do that the former President made a deal with the Taliban that he would get all American forces out of Afghanistan by May 1.
In return, the commitment was madeand that was a year beforein return, he was given a commitment that the Taliban would continue to attack others, but would not attack any American forces.
Remember that? I'm being serious.
Q. Mr. President
The President. No, I'm asking you a question. Be abecause before I
Q. Donald Trump is not the President right now.
The President. No, nonow wait a minute. I'm asking you a question. Is that accurate, to the best of your knowledge?
Q. I know what you're talking about. But, Mr. President, respectfully
The President. What?
Q. sinceI don't think that the issue thatdo you think that people have an issue with pulling out of Afghanistan or just the way that things have happened?
The President. I think they have an issue that people are likely to get hurtsome, as we've seen, have gotten killedand that it is messy. The reason whywhether my friend will acknowledge it, in other words, reported itthe reason why there were no attacks on Americans, as you said, from the date until I came into office, was because the commitment was made by President Trump: ""I will be out by May 1. In the meantime, you agree not to attack any Americans."" That was the deal. That's why no American was attacked.
Timeline for the Withdrawal of U.S. Military Forces From Afghanistan 
Q. And you said that you stilla few days ago, you said you squarely stand by your decision to pull out.
The President. Yes, I do. Because look at it this way, folksand I'm going toI have another meeting, for real. But imagine where we'd be if I had indicated, on May the 1st, I was not going to renegotiate an evacuation date; we were going to stay there.
I'd have only one alternative: Pour thousands of more troops back into Afghanistan to fight a war that we had already won, relativeis why the reason we went in the first place.
I have never been of the view that we should be sacrificing American lives to try to establish a democratic government in Afghanistan, a country that has never once in its entire history been a united country and is made upand I don't mean this in a derogatorymade up of different tribes who have never, ever, ever gotten along with one another.
And so, as I said beforeand this is the last comment I'll make, but we'll have more chance to talk about this, unfortunately, beyond, because we're not out yetif Usama bin Laden, as well as Al Qaida, had chosen to launch an attackwhen they left Saudi Arabiaout of Yemen, would we have ever gone to Afghanistan? Even though the Taliban completely controlled Afghanistan at the time, would we have ever gone?
I know it's not fair to ask you questions. It's rhetorical. But raise your hand if you think we should have gone and given up thousands of lives and tens of thousands of wounded.
Our interest in going was to prevent Al Qaida from reemergingfirst to get bin Laden, wipe out Al Qaida in Afghanistan, and prevent that from happening again.
As I've said a hundred times: Terrorism has metastasized around the world; we have greater threats coming out of other countries a heck of a lot closer to the United States. We don't have military encampments there; we don't keep people there. We have over-the-horizon capability to keep them from going after us.
Ladies and gentlemen, it was time to end a 20-year war.
Thank you so much.

2021-08-25 00:00:00,Remarks on Cybersecurity and an Exchange With Reporters,"
The President. Well, thank you all for being here to discuss the core national security challenge we're facing, the American people are facing, and our economy is facing with cybersecurity. We've seen time and again how the technologies we rely onfrom our cell phones to pipelines, to the electric gridcan become targets of hackers and criminals.
At the same time, our skilled cybersecurity workforce has not grown fast enough to keep pace. We're aboutthe estimates many of you have given us and we've concluded areon our ownabout a half a million cybersecurity jobs remain unfilled. That's a challenge, but it also is a real opportunity. And I've made itthis a priority for my administration from the outset.
And in May, I issued an Executive order to modernize our defenses and improve our Federal Government's cybersecurity. Because of that order, Government will only buy tech products that meet certain cybersecurity standards, which will have a ripple effect across the software industry, in our view, ultimately improving security for all Americans.
We've launched a hundred-day initiative to improve cybersecurity across the electric sector. That initiative has already resulted in more than 150 utilities that serve 90 million Americans being deployed. And we're committing to deploy cybersecurity technologies that are extending that initiative asto gas pipelines as well, next. That's where we're going.
And because the cybersecurity is a global issue, we've also rallied G-7 countries to hold nations who harbor ransomware criminals accountable. And, I might add, I had a summit with Vladimir Putin and made it clear to him that we expected him to hold them accountable as well, because they know where they are and who they are. But that's another issue we will not be discussing so much today.
We updated NATO cyber policy for the first time in 7 years. And today my team is hosting a meeting, bringing together 30 of the nations30 nations to step up in their fight against ransomware.
But the reality is, most of our critical infrastructure owned and operatedis owned and operated by the private sector, and the Federal Government can't meet this challenge alone.
So I've invited you all here today because you have the power, the capacity, and the responsibility, I believe, to raise the bar on cybersecurity.
And so, ultimately, we got a lot of work to do. And thank you all very much. And thank the press for being here. We're going to go private now.
Withdrawal of U.S. Military Forces From Afghanistan 
Q. Mr. President, if Americans are still in Afghanistan after the deadline, what will you do? Sir, what will you do if Americans are still there after the deadline? No? Okay.

2021-08-24 00:00:00,Remarks on House of Representatives Passage of a Budget Resolution for Fiscal Year 2022 and Voting Rights Legislation and United States Evacuation Efforts in Afghanistan,"
The President. Hello, folks. Thebefore I update you on the meeting that I had with leaders of the G-7 earlier today, I want to say a word about the progress we're making on the Build Back Better agenda here at home.
I just got off the telephone with the leaders in the House. Today the House of Representatives has taken a significant step toward making a historic investment that's going to transform America, cut taxes for working families, and position the American economy for long-term, long-term growth.
When I became President, it was clear that we had to confront an immediate economic crisis, the most significant recession we've had since the Depression or at least since Johnson. But we weren't going tobut that wasn't going to be enough.
We also had to make some long-term investments in Americans and America itself. The first thing we did was to write and pass the American Rescue Plan, and it's working. Our economy has added 4 million jobs in my first 6 months in office. Economic growth is up to the fastest it's beenthe fastest rate in 40 years. And unemployment is coming down.
Right now our economic growth is leading the world's advanced economies. But to win the future, we need to take the next step. And today the House of Representatives did just that.
Thattoday's vote in the House allowed them to consider my Build Back Better agenda, a broad framework to make housing more affordable; bring down the cost of prescription drugs by giving Medicare the power to negotiate lower prices for drugs; make eldercare more affordable; provide 2 years of free, universal, high-quality pre-K and 2 years of free community college; provide clean energy tax credits; continue to give the middle class families the well-deserved tax cut for daycare and health care that they deserve, allowing a lot of women to get back to work, primarily; and provide significant monthly tax cuts for working families with children through the childcare tax credit.
These investments are going to lower out-of-pocket expenses for families and not just give them a little more breathing room. In addition, we're going to make long-overdue, much-needed investments in basic, hard infrastructure of this Nation.
Therethis is an area where we have broad, bipartisan agreement to invest in our antiquated roads, highways, bridges, transit, drinking water systems, broadband, clean energy, environmental cleanup, and making infrastructure more resilient to climateto the climate crisis, and so much more.
And this is all paid forinstead of giving every break in the world to corporations and CEOs. By the way, 55 of our largest companies in America paid zero dollars in Federal taxes on more than $40 billion in profit last year.
We can ask corporations and the very wealthy just to pay their fair share. They can still be very wealthy. They can still make a lot of money, but just begin to pay their fair share so we can invest in making our country stronger and more competitive, create jobs and raise wages, and lift up the standard of living for everyone.
The bottom line is, in my view, we're a step closer to truly investing in the American people, positioning our economy for long-term growth, and building an America that outcompetes the rest of the world. My goal is to build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not just the top down. And that's what we're on our way of doing.
Look, I want to thank Speaker Pelosi, who was masterful in her leadership on this, and Leader Hoyer and Whip Clyburn and Chairman DeFaziothe entire House leadership teamfor the hard work, dedication, and determination to bring people together so we can make a difference in people's lives.
I also want to thank every Democrat in the House who worked so hard over the past few weeks to reach an agreement and who supported the process for House consideration of the jobs and infrastructure plan, the Build Back Better effort.
There were differences, strong points of view. They're always welcome. What is important is that we came together to advance our agendaI think everyone who did thatI think everyone. Everyone who did it was there.
Look, I also want to thank everyone who voted to support the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. You know, advancingit's an act to restore and expand voting protections, to prevent voter suppression, and to secure the most sacred of American rights: the right to vote freely, the right to vote fairly, and the right to have your vote counted.
The House has acted. The Senate also has to join them to send this important bill to my desk. And the Senate must also move on the [For the]* People's Act, critical legislation to protect our democracy and the right to vote. We need both of thosethose election bills.
But let me now turn to Afghanistan. I've met this morning with my counterparts in the G-7, as well as heads of the United Nations, NATO, and the European Union. I expressed my thanks for the solidarity we have seen as we've stood up an unprecedented global effort. I updated our partners on the significant progress we've made in the past 10 days.
As of this afternoon, we've helped evacuate 70,700 people, just since August the 14th; 75,900 people since the end of July. Just in the past 12 hours, another 19 U.S. military flights, 18 C-17s, and one C-130 carrying approximately 6,400 evacuees and 31 coalition flights carrying 5,600 people have left Kabul, just in the last 12 hours. A total of 50 more flights, 12,000 more people since we updated you this morning.
These numbers are a testament to the efforts of our brave service women and men, to our diplomats on the ground in Kabul, and to our allies still standing with us.
And we had a productive discussion, and there was strong agreement among the leaders aboutboth about the evacuation mission underway, as well as the need to coordinate our approach to the Afghanto Afghanistan as we move forward.
First, on evacuation, we agreed that we will continue to closeour close cooperation to get people out as efficiently and safely as possible. We are currently on a pace to finish by August the 31st. The sooner we can finish, the better. Each day of operations brings added risk to our troops.
But the completion by August 31 depends upon the Taliban continuing to cooperate and allow access to the airport for those who werewe're transporting out and no disruptions to our operations. In addition, I've asked the Pentagon and the State Department for contingency plans to adjust the timetable should that become necessary.
I'm determined to ensure that we complete our missionthis mission. I'm also mindful of the increasing risks that I've been briefed on and the need to factor those risks in.
There are real and significant challenges that we also have to take into consideration. The longer we stay, starting with the acute and growing risk of an attack by a terrorist group known as ISIS-K, an ISIS affiliate in Afghanistanwhich is the sworn enemy of the Taliban as wellevery day we're on the ground is another day we know that ISIS-K is seeking to target the airport and attack both U.S. and allied forces and innocent civilians.
Additionally, thus far, the Taliban have been taking steps to work with us so we can get our people out, but it's a tenuous situation. We're alreadyhad some gun fighting break out. We run a serious risk of it breaking down as time goes on.
Second, the G-7 leaders, and the leaders of the EU, NATO, and the U.N., all agreed that we will stand united in our approach to the Taliban. We agreed the legitimacy of any future government depends on the approach it now takes to uphold their international obligations, including to prevent Afghanistan from being used as a base for terrorism.
And we agreed that none of us are going to take the Taliban's word for it. We will judge them by their actions. And we will stay in close coordination on any steps that we take moving forward in response to the Taliban's behavior.
At the same time, we renewed our humanitarian commitment to the Afghan people and supported a proposal by the Secretary-General Guterres of the United Nations-led international response with unfettered humanitarian access in Afghanistan.
Third, we talked about our mutual obligation to support refugees and evacuees currently fleeing Afghanistan. The United States will be a leader in these efforts and will look to the international community and to our partners to do the same.
We're already seeing our allies' commitment. They're bringing theirthey're bringing to their countries the Afghans who served alongside their forces as translators or in their embassies, just as we're bringing to the United States those Afghans who worked alongside our forces and diplomats. We're continuing that effort.
We're conducting thorough security screening in the intermediate stops they're making for anyone who is not a U.S. citizen or a lawful permanent resident of the United States. Anyone arriving in the United States will have undergone a background check.
And we must all work together to resettle thousands of Afghans who ultimately qualify for refugee status. The United States will do our part. And we are already working closely with refugee organizations to rebuild a system that was purposefully destroyed by my predecessor.
Finally, we agreed to stay vigilant against terrorist threats that have metastasized around the world.
We went to Afghanistan with our allies in 2001 for clear reasons: One, to get the people who attacked us on 9/11 and to get Usama bin Laden and to make sure that Afghanistan was not used again as a base from which to attack the United States or our allies. We achieved that objective. We delivered justice to bin Laden more than a decade ago.
But the current environment looks very different than it did in 2001, and we have to meet the challenges we face today. We run effective counterterrorism operations around the world where we know terrorism is more of a threat than it is today in Afghanistan, without any permanent military presence on the ground. And we can and will do the same thing in Afghanistan with our over-the-horizon counterterrorism capability. Cooperation with our closest partners on our enduring counterterrorism mission will continue to be an essential piece of our strategy.
In short, we allall of us agreed today that we're going to stand shoulder to shoulder with our closest partners to meet the current challenges we face in Afghanistan, just as we have for the past 20 years. We're acting in consultation and cooperation with our closest friends and fellow democracies.
And I want to again thank all of our allies and partners around the world who have rallied in support of our shared mission. We ended the conversation today by a cleara statement on all of our parts. We are going to stay united, locked at the hip, in terms of what we have to do. We'll get that done.
And tomorrow I've asked Secretary Blinken to give you an update and a detailed report on exactly how many Americans are still in Afghanistan and how many we got out and what our projection is.
So thank you again. And God bless you, and may God protect our diplomats and all those in harm's way.
Thank you.
Q. Mr. President, can you guarantee every American will be out before the troops leave? Can you guarantee?
Q. Sanctions? Sanctions, Mr. President? Did sanctions come up at all in the G-7 meeting?

2021-08-23 00:00:00,Remarks Honoring the Women's National Basketball Association Champion Seattle Storm,"
The President. Please, please, be seated. Thank you. Well, I'll tell you what, the last time I was in a room with this many great athletes, I was having dinner with my granddaughters. [Laughter]
Look, I tell you what, it's an honor to have you here. I mean, it really is a genuine honor to have you all here. You have no idea. I don't know how these guys got in this damn picture, but[laughter]it's okay. They're all right.
And look, I'm honored to welcome to the White House the 2020 WNBA Champions, the Seattle Storm. You're an inspiring team, and you represent a hell of a city, a great American city, and a groundbreaking league. The only all-female ownership group in pro sportsLisa, Ginny, and Dawn: Congratulations. Congratulations.
I may need work after this. I'd be a good ball boy. I can[laughter]I can[inaudible].
Commissioner Cathy, it's great to have you here. Thank you for your leadership of the WNBA, and now celebrating 25 years of excellence.
And to the players, congratulations and thank you for being you. And thank you for believing in one another.
You know, the Bidens are a sports family. We're one ofI haveone of our granddaughters, Maisy, is a great athlete, loves to play basketball, but also is allfirst team all-state in two different sports and is now at Penn playing soccer. I haveand I have a granddaughter whoanother granddaughter who's a hell of a ball player as well. I have a niecemy sister's daughterwho was first team all-American and all-Ivy in lacrosse. And I can go on and on.
We all thought we were pretty good athletesthe men in our family. I wasn't a bad ball player. I wasn't a bad football and baseball playermy brothers. But I've got to admit, all the women are better than us. [Laughter] All of them. You think I'm joking, I'm not. They're first rate.
And our White House is full of athletes, including some of my top aides. Annie Tomasini played point guard at Boston University. Anniewhere are you, Annie? I'm going to embarrass you. Stand up, Annie.
I'm going to divert here in just a second. Another guy, who's a great guy that was working with me when I was trying to get the nomination a hundred years ago when we were in Iowawhich was an adventure[laughter]and we were going from one county to the next. And this guy is 6'5''. I don't want to give you his name. He's a hell of an athlete. He's six-foot-five.
And he was the driver, and Annie was in the back making sure we knew where we were going. And we showed up to thisthis high school where we were going to speak, but it turned out we werewe didn't want to ruin our reputation. We were early. And wethat ruins my reputation, because I'm usually always late.
And we pulled up, and we pulled into the school parking lot. And there was a basketball, underneath one of the baskets, sitting there. And we were the only one in the parkwe wereit turned out we got the time wrong. We were about an hour early.
So I turn to this guy Mark, and I said, ""Mark, see that ball in""and I saidI said, ""I bet you 20 bucks Annie can beat you in high heels."" [Laughter] And she said, ""Oh, give me a break."" I mean, I said: ""No, come on. Let's go to 10. You know, winner keeps the ball, and you keep going."" Annie is outgoes out in high heels and blew him away 10 to 3. [Laughter] And he wasn't a bad athlete. But anywayanyway, Annie is good at everything she does. [Laughter]
And Susan RiceAmbassador Rice, she played high school basketball, and her niece is the top of the high school playersone of the top high school players in the country and may just be in the W one day. Wherewhere are you, SusanAmbassador Rice? Her expertise is foreign policy, so I asked her to take over domestic policy for me. But anyway, Susan[laughter]I'm anxious to meet your niece.
This is a big day for so many of us, including for two great members of Congress here today: Represent-Representative Rick Larsen from the State of Washington's Second District. Where are you, Rick? There you are, Rick. Come on, stand up. Let me see you, Rick. And Representative Kim Schrier. Kim, thank you. And welcome, Kim. She represents Washington's Eighth District. And it's her 35th birthday today. Happy birthday.
And this organization is no stranger to success: four WNBA championships, tied for the most of any franchise; and five players are Olympianstwo from Australia and three from the United States. You know, Breanna Stewart, Sue Bird, Jewell Loyd: Thank you for bringing the gold home. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
My wife Jill led our delegation to Tokyo, and it was one of the great honors of her life. And what you accomplished there was incredible, winning the seventh straight basketball gold for Team U.S.A. Let's give a round for them.
Jewell's first gold, Breanna's second, and Sue's fifth. But who's counting? [Laughter] Who's counting? The record for any basketball player that playedman or womenthat she shares with Diana. And I just think it's incredible.
Back in March, we had the honor of welcoming Sue's fiance andfiance, Meganexcuse me, Megan came, and we tried to get her outside playing soccer with us, but it didn't work quite well, but[laughter]because we couldn't keep up. And they came to the White House to mark Equal Pay Day. And it's long past due for Equal Pay Day for women in America. Between the two of them, they share Olympic medals, World Cup titles, the WNBA Championship, and above all, they define integrity and character.
As President, as an American, I'm proud of how they've represented us. And they represent the best of what America stands for, as does this whole team.
In the WNBA, amidst a year unlike any other, this team met the moment, sweeping through the playoffs and finals against Minnesota and Las Vegas, and six wins and no losses. Masterful defense, shooting, and teamwork. Breanna earning the Finals MVP that was joined by her Olympic MVP award.
And by the way, Breanna is from Syracuse, New York. I went to Syracuse. [Laughter] How come you didn't? You went to Connecticut. [Laughter] I remember. I remember.
Forward Breanna Stewart. I'm sorry.
The President. I just want you to knowjust rememberwhat high school did you go to in Syracuse?
Ms. Stewart. Cicero-North Syracuse.
The President. Yes, Iyou know, it was a great disappointment. [Laughter] But you know it's true. I'm not joking. [Laughter] You know it's true. Everybody knew how incredible she was when she was in high school.
But what's even more special is, she and her wife just became moms for their new baby, Ruby. Congratulations. A WBAa WNBA championship, Olympic gold, and a precious Ruby. And what a year, Breanna. It's aIit's a hell of year you've had, kid.
And what makes this team remarkable is, they don't just win games, they change lives: encouraging people to get vaccinated so we can beat this pandemic; speaking out and standing up for racial justice and voting rights; supporting education and membership programs for young people andexcuse me, mentorship programs for young people; and fighting to protect trans youth from an epidemic of violence and discrimination.
That's what winners do. They shine the light. They lift people up. They're a force for change. That's the Seattle Storm. That's the WNBA. That's what they do. For 25 years, the WNBA has been changing what's possible for millions of women and girls all across the world. You give peopleyou give them courage.
You know, I can say as much as I wantfrom the time my two daughters were bornthat you can do anything a man can do. It's one thing for somebody to say that and keep pounding that in the head of your five granddaughters as well. But guess what? Until they see it, until they watch, it becomes real then.
That's why, by the way, she'sand happens to be in Asia for me right nowbut that's why we have a female Vice President of United States of America who's going to bewe're going to have some Presidents pretty soon.
And redefining what sports can mean in the life of a community and the never-ending work of building a more just, a more equal, and a more perfect Union. That's why, as a nation, we need to support women's sports, not just during the Olympics, but during the yearduring every seasonby showing up in person and watching on TV, with more sponsorships and programming to help grow the business of women's sports.
And these women are amazing athletes. They're the best in the world. And we honor them by showing up for them. To the whole Storm family, thank you all and congratulations. And best of luck for thisthe rest of the season.
Now, I want to ask Storm co-owner Ginny Gilder to come up and say a few words, if you will, Ginny.
Co-owner Ginny Gilder. Ah, I get to take this off.
The President. I forgot my mask. I'm going to get in trouble.
Ms. Gilder. Oh, especially if you come near me.
The President. What did I do with my mask? There you go.
Ms. Gilder. You good? [Laughter]
Every championship pro sports team in reaching the pinnacle of athletic excellence is extraordinary. That's certainly the case with the 2020 WNBA champions, who pretty much ran away with the trophy. The women before you swept through the playoffs and won the last game of the finals by over 30 points.
[Ms. Gilder continued her remarks, concluding as follows.]
In Seattle, inspired and informed by our players, our franchise formalized its own history of advocacy by creating a social justice platform, Force4Change. Today, Crystal Langhorne, one of our two-time WNBA champions and now retired, leads that effort as a member of our executive team. I've asked her to come up and give you just a taste of the work that she's leading.
Thank you, President Biden, for recognizing these women, for helping lead the way to a more equitable and just tomorrow.
Force4Change Director of Community Engagement Crystal Langhorne. Mask off. Good afternoon, everyone.
We are truly honored to be here for our achievements on the court, but I think I can speak for all of us from the Storm organization: We are extremely proud of who we are off the court. Force4Change focuses on creating a more equitable society: on amplifying Black women, BIPOC youth, and the LGBTQ+ community. But it's not just about amplifying; it's about investing into communities that have been underserved and working with the organizations that have been leading the way in this space.
This summer, we worked with our community partners and together invested $100,000 in the Urban League of Metropolitan Seattle, matching what we invested to the NAACP's Legal Defense Fund last year. Social justice cannot fade into the background. We have to continue to amplify, invest, and do whatever we can to be a force for change.
Being the first women's team to visit this administrationan administration that aligns with so many of our valuesis such an honor. So thank you. And now I'm proud to turn this over to my former teammatesour three Olympic gold medalistsSue Bird, Jewell Loyd, and Breanna Stewart, who will present President Biden with his jersey.

2021-08-23 00:00:00,Remarks on the COVID-19 Response and National Vaccination Efforts,"
Good afternoon.
Today we've hit another milestonea key milestonein our Nation's fight against COVID. The Food and Drug Administration, the FDA, announced that it's fully concluded itsits nowits thorough and independent scientific review. After a strict process, the FDA has reaffirmed its findings that the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective, and the FDA has given its full and final approval.
So let me say this loudly and clearly: If you haveif you're one of the millions of Americans who said that they will not get the shot when it'suntil it has full and final approval of the FDA, it has now happened. The moment you've been waiting for is here, and it's time for you to go get your vaccination and get it today. Today. It's an important moment in our fight against the pandemic.
You know, I want to thank the Acting Commissioner, Janet Woodcock, and the entire team at the FDA for their hard work. Dr. Woodcock is a true professional. She's a career scientist who served under Republican Presidents and Democratic Presidents. She's ensured that the team followed the science above all.
They've looked at the mountains of clinical dataclinical trial data and the safety and efficiency [efficacy]* data and concluded, without question, the vaccine was safe and effective for emergency use in December. That same thingwe've got those shots in arms at the time: 350 million in the United States and billions across the world. They kept pouring over this data. The FDA approval is the gold standard.
And as I just said, now it has been granted. Those who have been waiting for full approval should go get your shot now. Vaccination is free. It's easy, it's safe, and it's effective. And it's convenient. For 90 percent of Americans, there's a vaccination site less than 5 miles from your home, and you can get the shot without an appointment. So please, get your shot today. There is no time to waste.
The Delta variant is dangerous and spreading, causing a pandemic of the unvaccinated. That's the pandemic of the vaccinated. And while we're starting to see initial signs that cases may be declining in a few places, nationwide, cases are still rising, especially among the unvaccinated.
Across the country, virtually all of the COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths continue to be among the unvaccinated. That's worse in States where vaccination rates are overall low. But even in States where many people are vaccinated, the unvaccinated are still at risk.
Let me be clear: There are cases where vaccinated people do get COVID-19, but they are far less common than unvaccinated people getting COVID-19. And most importantly, their conditions are far less severe. The overwhelming majority of people in the hospital who have COVID-19 arealmost all of those dying from COVID-19 are not vaccinated. Not vaccinated. If you're fully vaccinatedboth shots, plus 2 weeksyour risk of severe illness from COVID-19 is very, very, very low.
Now, I know that parents are concerned about COVID-19 cases among their children. I'll be addressing this soon with Secretary Cardona to discuss how to get our kids back to school safely. Cases among children are still rare, and severe cases among children are very, very rare. But I know that parents are thinking about their own kids, and it's not as reassuring as anyone would like it to be.
So let me say this as parentsto the parents: As you haveyou have the tools. You have the tools to keep your child safer, and two of those tools, above all, are available to you. One, make sure that everyone around your child, who can be vaccinated, is vaccinated: parents, adults, teens. Two, make sure your child is masked when they leave home. That's how we can best keep our kids safe.
As I've said before, the pandemic of the unvaccinated is a tragedy that is preventable. People are dying, and will die, who don't have to. So please, please, if you haven't gotten your vaccinationif you haven't gotten vaccinated, do it now. It could save your life and the lives of those you love.
Now, the good news is that people are getting vaccinated. For the past several weeks, my administration has imposed new vaccine requirements on Federal workers, the Armed Forces, people who work in Federal medical facilities, and nursing home workers. Governors, mayors, and private sector leaders have done the same.
We've also encouraged new incentives. For example, in some States, you get $100 if you get vaccinated. These new requirements and incentives are accelerating vaccinations once again, giving us the hope that we can put this Delta variant behind us in the weeks ahead.
There are three facts everyone should know about where we are in this fight against this pandemic. First, even as the Delta variant has ravaged the unvaccinated, the deaths have climbedand deaths have climbed, the death rate is still 70-percent lower than what it was last winter. Why? Because we did such a good job vaccinating those most at risk: senior citizens. America has about 54 million senior citizens. About 50 million have at least have gotten at least one shot. That's almost 92 percent.
Secondly, overall, weekly new vaccinations are up more than 56 percent from where they were a month ago. Last week, we saw a record of vaccinations, more than 1 million shots a day for 3 straight days. This is the first time this has happened since June. Six million shots in the last 7 days, the highest 7-day total in over a month and a half
Rememberremember when we were trying to get 70 percent of the people over 18 at least one shot? Well, we've not only gotten that done; we've gotten 71 percent of everyone age 12 and older their first shot. That's over 200 million Americans. And over 170 million are now fully vaccinated.
Third, States that had been lagging are seeing their vaccination rates grow faster. In fact, in Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi, more people got new vaccinations in the past month than in the prior 2 months combined. The progress we're making on vaccinations now is going to produce results in the weeks ahead. The sooner you get fully vaccinated, the sooner you'll be protected.
According to the experts from the Yale School of Public Health, the pace of our vaccination effort has saved over 100,000 lives and have prevented more than 450,000 hospitalizations. This is critical progress, but we need to move faster.
As I mentioned before, I've imposed vaccination requirements that will reach millions of Americans. Today I'm calling on more countriesmore companies, I should say, in the private sector to step up with vaccine requirements that will reach millions more people. If you're a business leader, a nonprofit leader, a State or local leader who has been waiting for full FDA approval to require vaccinations, I call on you now to do thatrequire it. Do what I did last month and require your employees to get vaccinated or face strict requirements.
And as I said last week, vaccination requirements have been around for decades. Students, health care professionals, our troops are typically required to receive vaccination to prevent everything from polio to smallpox, measles, mumps, rubella.
In fact, the reason most people in America don't worry about polio, smallpox, measles, mumps, and rubella today is because of vaccines. It only makes sense to require a vaccine to stop the spread of COVID-19.
With today's FDA full approval, there's another good reason to get vaccinated. So please get vaccinated now. If you go to vaccines.com [vaccines.gov]*vaccines.com [vaccines.gov]*or text your ZIP Code to 438829438829you can find a number of vaccine sites near you, just minutes away, where you can get your shot without an appointment.
All around the world, people want these vaccines. Here in America, they're free, convenient, and waiting for you. So please go todayfor yourself, for your loved ones, for your neighbors, for your country.
I'll close with this: We're in the midst of a wartime effort to beat this pandemic. It's one of the biggest and most complicated challenges in our history. And it's based on an unparalleled vaccination program that is saving lives and beating this virus. It's a vaccination program that's getting us back to our loved ones and a way of life we were used to. It's happening, and it's going to keep happening if you helpit helps our economy. It gets everything moving. It keeps us growing.
Together, we've made significant progress in just 7 months. We just have to finish the job with science, facts, and confidence, togethertogetheras the United States of America. So, please get vaccinated today.
God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you.

2021-08-22 00:00:00,"Remarks on the Flooding in Tennessee, Tropical Storm Henri, and United States Evacuation Efforts in Afghanistan and an Exchange With Reporters","
The President. Good afternoon. After a series of meetings throughout the weekend with my national security team, I want to update the American people on our ongoing evacuation operation in Afghanistan.
But first, I just was briefed by the FEMA Administrator, who is here with me todayMs. Criswellabout the flash flooding in Waverly, Tennessee, and surrounding areas in Tennessee. I want to begin by expressing my deepest condolences for the sudden and tragic loss of life due to this flash flood. I know we've reached out to the community, and we stand ready to offer them support. I've asked the Administrator to speak to Governor Lee of Tennessee right away, and we'll offer any assistance they need for this terrible moment.
Let me also say a few words about what is now Tropical Stormnot hurricaneHenri, which made landfall at approximately 12:15 this afternoon in Rhode Island. Henri is impacting much of the Northeast right now, and I want to talk about our efforts to prepare and respond to this storm. We have been closely monitoring Henri's progress and making the necessary preparations. Fortunately, it's no longer a hurricane; it's been downgraded to a tropical storm. And we are taking it seriously though, because of the size and the storm's surge and the rainfall it's producing. It's also impacting an area of the country that has already experienced heavy rainfall over the past several days.
And while New Englanders are used to dealing with some tough weather, this storm has the potential for widespread consequences across the region, with significant flooding and power outages that could affect hundreds of thousands of people.
And so we're doing everything we can now to help these States prepare, respond, and recover. I can't think of anyone better to lead this operation than Deanne Criswell of theof FEMA. She'sbefore she headed up FEMA, she led the emergency response in New York City, and she was one of the key Federal officials leading our response to Superstorm Sandy. She knows this area very, very well and knows what's needed better than anyone.
Yesterday I talked with the Administrator and each of the Governors in the key States most likely to be affected. I urged them to take advantage of the assistance FEMA can offer in advance and committed to doing everything we can to support their communities through the storm and afterwards.
FEMA has already prepositioned resources in the region to speed our ability to respond, including food, water, and lifesaving communications equipment, as well as generators. In close cooperation with the electrical sector, preparations are in place to address significant power outages. And resources and support is staged at the edge of this storm to be able to move quickly in to help.
Thousands of additional line crews and vegetation-clearing crews from other States and from Canada are already heading toward the impacted States in New England, ready to serve asmove in as soon as it's feasible. They'll clean up fallen trees, help local utilities repair damaged lines, and restore electrical service as fast as possible. I want to thank these crews for their commitment to helping their fellow citizens in time of need.
I've already approvedI've already approvedemergency declarations for Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New York, which activates funds and means we can get in there and help as soon as this extreme weather has moved through.
We don't know the full extent of the storm's impact today, but we are acting to prepare for and prevent damage as much as possible and to speed help to affected communities so they can recover as quickly as possible. I also want to encourage everyone to do their part to prepare, follow the guidance from their local authorities. Some places have already had heavy rains and winds and dangerous storm surges.
Henri is going to continue to move across much of the Northeast, so it is important to monitor it closely and be prepared in your home and your community. Make sure you have the supplies for your entire household, including necessary medications and food, water, battery-powered radios in case of extended power outages. And don't forget that you may need to seek shelter while you're battling the Delta variant and the COVID-19. So wear a mask, and try to observe social distancing.
And to everyone across the country, don't get caught by the next storm. Get vaccinated. Get vaccinated now. Protect yourself and your family against COVID-19. It's going to be a vital part of emergency preparedness this yearfor the remainder of this year.
Now, let me turn to Afghanistan. I've continued to make progress since I spoke to you on Friday. We have moved thousands of people each day by U.S. military aircraft and civilian charter flights. A little over 30 hoursin a little over 30 hours this weekend, we've evacuated an extraordinary number of people, as I will detail in a minute: about 11,000 individuals. That number will change day to day as the air and ground operations in Kabul vary.
Our first priority in Kabul is getting American citizens out of the country as quickly and as safely as possible. At my direction, the State Department continues to reach out to the remaining Americans we have identified by phone, e-mail, and other means to ascertain their whereabouts and their plans.
We're executing a plan to move groups of these Americans to safety and to safely and effectively move them to the airport compound. For security reasons, I'm not going to go into the detail of what these plans entail, but I will say again today that I have said before: Any American who wants to get home will get home.
We've also been evacuating the citizens of our NATO allies and our partners, including their diplomats, their embassy staff who remain in Afghanistan, and to get them back to their homes as well. And as we do this, we're also working to move our Afghan allies, who stood with us side by side, and other vulnerable Afghans, such as women leaders and journalists, out of the country.
As of this morning, we have evacuated nearly 28,000 people since August the 14th, on both U.S. and coalition aircraft, including civilian charters, bringing the total number of people we have evacuated since July to approximately 33,000 persons.
In one 24-hour period this weekend, 23 U.S. military flightsincluding 14 C-17s, 9 C-130 flightsleft Kabul carrying 3,900 passengers. We see no reason why this tempo will not be kept up. During the same period, our military facilitated another 35 charter flights carrying an additional nearly 4,000 evacuees to other countries that are taking them out. Altogether, we lifted approximately 11,000 people out of Kabul in less than 36 hours. It's an incredible operation.
Let me be clear: The evacuation of thousands of people from Kabul is going to be hard and painful no matter when it started and when we began. It would have been true if we had started a month ago or a month from now. There is no way to evacuate this many people without pain and loss, of heartbreaking images you see on television. It's just a fact. My heart aches for those people you see.
We are proving that we can move, though, thousands of people a day out of Kabul. We're bringing our citizens, NATO allies, Afghanis who had helpedin fact, has helped us in the war effort. But we have a long way to go, and a lot could still go wrong.
But to move out 30,000 people in just over a week, that's a great testament to the men and women on the ground in Kabul and our Armed Services. It also reflects a tireless diplomatic effort. In order to keep a steady flow of planes taking off from Kabul and maximize our evacuation capacity, we have quickly stood up an unprecedented global effort and established a series of processing stations in third countries.
In short, we're not flying them directly to their country, we're flying to these processing stations where we're working with more than two dozen countries across four continents. I've secured agreementswe've secured agreements with the Gulfexcuse meacross the Gulf, in Central Asia, and in Europe, including processing centers in Qatar, Germany, Kuwait, Spain, and elsewhere that allows us to sort and process these evacuees.
This transitthese transit centers provide a safe place for the SIV applicants and other vulnerable Afghanis and their families to complete their paperwork while we conduct security screenings and background checks before they continue on to their final destination in the United States or in another country, one of our NATO allies as well.
And so, from Asia to Africa, from Europe to Westernto the Western Hemisphere, nations are making generous offers to support resettlements efforts. And I've been in personal contact with the leaders of many countries, including Qatar, Germany, Spain, Italy, the U.A.E., and othersthey're making vital contributionsto thank them for their support and to discuss how we can continue to coordinate our efforts in Afghanistan, moving forward. It's the reason why I continue in contact with them. And I want to, again, thank all of our partners for their continuedcontinuing to stand together.
We've also activated the first stage of what's referred to as the Civil Reserve Air Fleet to help with the onward movement of evacuees from these transit centers. Our military aircraft and others will get them to these centers, but then we're going to get the Civil Reserve Fleetit's a program that's designedthat was designed in the wake of the Berlin Airlift after World War IIto use commercial aircraft to augment our airlift capacity. This is a voluntary program for our commercial airlines, and we're grateful for those airlines and the U.S. carriers who are supporting this.
This effort will only use three or four planes from each of the major carriers' vast fleets of aircraft, so there should be no effect, or a minimal effect, on commercial air travel. And we'll stay in close coordination with our partners to mitigate any impact.
These Civil Reserve flights will be helping facilitate the safe movement of people from staging locations and transit centers, like Qatar and Germany, to the United States or to a third country. None of them will be landing in Kabul. Now, the American aircraft part of this will not be going to any country but the United States.
As this effort unfolds, I want to be clear about three things. One, planes taking off from Kabul are not flying directly to the United States. They're landing at U.S. military bases and transit centers around the world.
Number two, at these sites where they're landing, we are conducting thorough scrutinysecurity screenings for everyone who is not a U.S. citizen or a lawful permanent resident. Anyone arriving in the United States will have undergone a background check.
Number three, once screened and cleared, we will welcome these Afghans, who helped us in the war effort over the last 20 years, to their new home in the United States of America. Because that's who we are. That's what America is.
You know, I've been touched by the outpouring of support that we've seen from communities and organizations across America mobilizing to support these efforts. So many of these Afghans stood bravely by U.S. troops in Afghanistan. And now the United States, including veterans groups, refugee settlement agencies, religious organizations, and so many others, are standing with our Afghan allies. It exemplifies the best of America.
And I want to say, again, just how difficult this mission is and how dangerousthe dangers it poses to our troops on the ground. The security environment is changing rapidly. There are civilians crowded at the airport, although we've cleared thousands of them. We know that terrorists may seek to exploit this situation and target innocent Afghans or American troops.
They're maintaining constant vigilance to monitorwe're maintaining the constant vigilance to monitor and disrupt threats offrom any source, including the likely source being ISIS-K, the Afghan affiliate referred to as ISIS-K. But we are under no illusions about the threat.
I said on Friday, ISIS-K is a sworn enemy of the Taliban, and they have a history of fighting one another. But every day we have troops on the ground, these troops and innocent civilians at the airport face the risk of attack from ISIS-K from a distance, even though we're moving back the perimeter significantly.
We're working hard and as fast as we can to get people out. That's our mission. That's our goal. And our determination to get every American citizen home and to evacuate our Afghan allies is unwavering.
We continue to see not only enormousthe enormous scope and scale of the effort, we will see the individual lives that are affected. The families that are desperate to get home to their loved ones in America. The communities of veterans who have mobilized to try and help their former interpreters get to safety. The frightened Afghans who aren't sure what to do. To state the obvious, it's heartbreaking. We're all seeing it. We see it. We feel it. You can't look at it and not feel it.
Nothing about this effort is easy, but the women and men of the United States Armed Forces are acting bravely and with professionalism and with a basic human compassion. I want to offer my profound thanks to our servicemembers on the ground in Kabul and to all those at U.S. bases around the world who are welcoming and caring for these evacuees.
And to all the diplomats and civil servants who are working around the clock to rescue American citizens, the citizens of our allies, our Afghan partners, vulnerable Afghanssuch as women leaders and journalistswhat we are doing is extraordinary, and you have to think of theof all they're doing. It's thanks to the people who, from all over the world, who are helping this effort.
So I want to thank you, and I'll keep you informed every day as we move forward. May God protect our troops and our diplomats andwho are serving in harm's way.
Now I'll take a few questions.
Darlene [Darlene Superville] from the Associated Press.
Timeline for the Withdrawal of U.S. Troops From Afghanistan 
Q. Mr. President
The President. Yes.
Q. Thank you. We're 9 days away from the August 31 deadline. Will you extend that deadline? Or what is your thought process on extending the evacuation operations?
The President. There's discussions going on among us and the military about extending. Our hope is we will not have to extend, but there are going to be discussions, I suspect, on how far along we are in the process.
Q. Mr. President
Q. Mr. President
The President. Mario Parker, Bloomberg.
Timeline for the Withdrawal of U.S. Troops From Afghanistan/Group of Seven (G-7) Nations/U.S. Evacuation Efforts in Afghanistan 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Just to piggyback off the August 31 deadline, you told the G-7 in Cornwall, you promised them support, back in June. If they ask for a larger or a longer American presence past the August 31 deadline, what will you tell them on Tuesday, sir?
The President. I will tell them that we'll see what we can do. Look, we are working closely with the G-7. I've spoken with most of the leaders of G-7. I'll be doing a conference with them, I think, TuesdayI'm not certainand we'll have that discussion.
But we arewe already have helped get out diplomats from other countries. We've already helped get out citizens from other countries, and we'll continue to do that.
Q. And, Mr. President, it sounded like that theyou've extended operations into Kabul, outside of the airport. Is that correct?
The President. What I'm not going to do is talk about the tactical changes we're making to make sure we maintain as much security as we can.
We have constantlyhow can I say it?increased rational access to the airport, where more folk can get there more safely. It's still a dangerous operation.
But I don't want to go into the detail of how we're doing that.
Q. Mr. President
Q. Mr. President
The President. Andrew [Andrew Restuccia] from the Wall Street Journal.
U.S. Evacuation Efforts in Afghanistan 
Q. Thanks, Mr. President. Our reporting on the ground shows that Afghans with the proper paperwork are still having trouble getting to the airport. Some say they feel abandoned by the U.S. U.S. Embassy staff still haven'tsome U.S. Embassy staff that are Afghan haven't been able to make it into the airport as well. Why isn't the U.S. doing more to allow Afghans into the airportto ensure access to the airport? And are you still opposed to setting up an extended perimeter around the airport to help ease that access?
The President. Number one, I think you're going to see they're going to get out. Number two, we have made a number of changes, including extending the access around the airport and the safe zone. And we've done a number of things, again, I don't want to get into detail about.
But the fact is that more and more of the groups we urgently want to get out of Afghanistan, starting with American citizens and the folks who worked in the embassies and personnel with our allies, as well as the Afghans who helped them and worked in those embassies, as well as those who helped them on the battlefield as wellwe are working diligently to make sure we've increased the ability to get them out. We've changed the gate operations and a whole range of things. And that's why we've been able to significantly increase the number of people we're getting out.
Taliban/Afghanistan 
Q. And will the Taliban agree to an extension past August 31? Have you discussed that with them?
The President. We've discussed a lot with the Taliban. They've been cooperative in extending some of the perimeter. That remains to be seen whether we ask that question.
Ed [Ed O'Keefe, CBS News], fire away.
Q. Thanks, Mr. President.
The President. I don't want you jumping over that[inaudible].
Withdrawal of U.S. Troops From Afghanistan/U.S. Counterterrorism Efforts 
Q. Just following up on Andrew's question. Because the United States is now negotiating with the Taliban over airport access and such, do you now trust them?
And then a question on the public response. A new poll, out today shows Americans wanted to withdraw from Afghanistan, but they disapprove of the way you've handled it. The poll also found that based in part of what transpired over the last week, a majority of Americansand forgive me, I'm just the messengerno longer consider you to be competent, focused, or effective at the job.
The President. I haven't seen that poll.
Q. It's out there, from CBS this morning. [Laughter] What would you say to those Americans who no longer believe that you can do the job?
The President. Look, I had a basic decision to make: I either withdraw America from a 20-year war that, depending on whose analysis you accept, cost us $150 million a day for 20 years or $300 million a day for 20 years; whoand Iyou know I carry this card with me every dayand whoin fact, where we lost 2,448 Americans dead and 20,722 wounded. Either increase the number of forces we'd keepwe keep there and keep that going or I end the war. And I decided to end the war.
As I said the other day: You know, the only reason we were in Afghanistan is, this is the place from which bin Laden attacked the United States of America. Had this been in another Middle Eastern country where he could have easily had moved from, we would have never gone to Afghanistan. So the question is, when is the right time to leave? Where are our national interests? Where do they lie?
And the idea that we are in a situation where we cannot recognize that terrorism has metastasized around the world and the need for us to focus in other parts of the world which create an even greater danger of an Al Qaida-like operation beginning, it can't be ignored. And we are, as you well knowbecause you follow thiswe are in a number of places where we're doing that without permanent basing of American forces there.
So I think when this is over, the American people will have a clear understanding of what I did, why we did it. Andbut look, that's the job. My job is to make judgments. My job is to make judgments no one else can or will make. I made them. I'm convinced I'm absolutely correct in not deciding to send more young women and men to war, for a war that, in fact, is no longer warranted.
Taliban/Withdrawal of U.S. Troops From Afghanistan 
Q. On the question of the Taliban though, do youare theydo you trust them now? Do you have deal with them?
The President. I don't trust anybody, including you. I love you, but you know[laughter]there's not a lot of people I trust tolook, the Taliban has athe Taliban has to make a fundamental decision: Is the Taliban going to attempt to be able to unite and provide for the well-being of the people of Afghanistan, which no one group has ever done since before dealingfor hundreds of years. And if it does, it's going to need everything from additional help, in terms of economic assistance, trades, and a whole range of things.
The Taliban has saidwe'll see whether they mean it or notthey're seeking legitimacy. They're seeking legitimacy to determine whether or not they will be recognized by other countries. They have told other countries, as well as us, they don't want us to move our diplomatic presence completely. But theyso, all of this is all just talk now. All just talk now.
And so, so far, the Taliban has not taken action against U.S. forces. So far, they have, by and large, followed through what they said, in terms of allowing Americans to pass through and the like. And I'm sure they don't control all of their forces. It's a ragtag force. And so we'll see. We'll see whether or not what they say turns out to be true.
But the bottom line is this, folks: Look, at the end of the day, if we didn't leave Afghanistan now, when do we leave? Another 10 years? Another 5 years? Another year? I'm not about to send your son or your daughter to fight in Afghanistan. I don't see where that is in our overwhelming interest.
And the talk about how our interests are going to be impacted: Let me tell you, you're sitting in Beijing, or you're sitting in Moscoware you happy we left? [Laughter] They'd love nothing better for us to continue to be bogged down there, totally occupied with what's going on.
So the idea, this isI think that history is going to record this was the logical, rational, and right decision to make.
So thank you all so very much. Thank you.
Taliban 
Q. Do you support the sanctions against the Taliban? The British are calling for sanctions. They're going to discuss sanctions on Tuesday. Would you support sanctions against the Taliban under certain conditions? On Friday, you mentioned ""harsh conditions"" if they misbehaved.
The President. The answer is ""yes."" It depends on the conduct.
Thanks.
Q. Mr. President, what about the ISIS and the threats that Americans face now?

2021-08-20 00:00:00,Remarks on United States Evacuation Efforts in Afghanistan and an Exchange With Reporters,"
The President. Good afternoon. I've just met with the Vice President, Secretary Blinken, Secretary Austin, National Security Adviser Sullivan, and other members the national security leadership team in the Situation Room to discuss our ongoing efforts to evacuate American citizens, third-country civilians, Afghan allies, and vulnerable Afghans. And I want to provide the American people with a brief update and theon the situation in Afghanistan.
Since I spoke to you on Monday, we've made significant progress. We have secured the airport, enabling flights to resume. Not just military flights, but civilian charters and otherfrom other countries and the NGOs taking out civilians and vulnerable Afghanis.
And now we have almost 6,000 troops on the ground, including the 82d Airborne providing runway security, the Army 10th Mountain Division standing guard around the airport, and the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit assisting the civilian departure.
This is one of the largest, most difficult airlifts in history. And the only country in the world capable of projecting this much power on the far side of the world with this degree of precision is the United States of America.
We've already evacuated more than 18,000 people since July and approximately 13,000 since our military airlift began on August the 14th. Thousands more have been evacuated on private charter flights facilitated by the U.S. Government.
These numbers include American citizens and permanent residents, as well as their families. It includes SIV applicants and their familiesthose Afghans who have worked alongside us, served alongside of us, gone into combat with us, and provided invaluable assistance to us, such as translators and interpreters.
The United States stands by its commitment that we've made to these people, and it includes other vulnerable Afghans, such as women leaders and journalists. In fact, working in close coordination with the management of the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the Wall Street Journal, we have successfully evacuated all 204 of their employees in Afghanistan on U.S. military aircraft earlier this week.
We have established the flow of flights, and we've increased the number of people we are moving out of the country. We paused flights in Kabul a few hours this morning to make sure we could process the arriving evacuees at the transit points, but our commander in Kabul has already given the order for outbound flights to resume.
Even with the pause, we moved out 5,700 evacuees yesterday, and we're working on a varietyto verify that number of the Americans that are still in the country as we work on this because we're notdon't have the exact number of people who areAmericans who are there. And those who may have come home to the United States, we're notwe want to get a strong number as to exactly how many people are there, how many American citizens, and where they are. Just yesterday, among the many Americans we evacuated, there were 169 Americans who, over thewe got over the wall into the airport using military assets.
We're also facilitating flights for our allies and our partners and working in close operational coordination with NATO on this evacuation. For example, we provided overwatch for the French convoy bringing hundreds of their people from the French Embassy to the airport.
These operations are going to continue over the coming days before we complete our drawdown. We're going to do everythingeverythingthat we can to provide safe evacuation for our Afghan allies, partners, and Afghans who might be targeted ifbecause of their association with the United States.
But let me be clear, any American who wants to come home, we will get you home.
But make no mistake: This evacuation mission is dangerous. It involves risks to our Armed Forces, and it is being conducted under difficult circumstances.
I cannot promise what the final outcome will be or what it will bethat it will be without risk of loss. But as Commander in Chief, I can assure you that I will mobilize every resource necessary. And as an American, I offer my gratitude to the brave men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces who are carrying out this mission. They're incredible.
And as we continue to work the logistics of evacuation, we're in constant contact with the Taliban, working to ensure civilians have safe passage to the airport. We are particularly focused on our engagements on making sure every American who wants to leave can get to the airport. Where we have beenseen challenges with Americansfor Americans, we have thus far been able to resolve them.
We've been ablewe've madelook, we've made clear to the Taliban that any attackany attack on our forces or disruption of our operations at the airport will be met with swift and forceful response.
We're also keeping a close watch on any potential terrorist threat at or around the airport, including from the ISIS affiliates in Afghanistan who were released from prison when the prisons were emptied. And because they are, by the wayto make everybody understandthat the ISIS in Afghanistan are thehave been the sworn enemy of the Taliban.
I've said all along: We're going to retain a laser focus on our counterterrorism mission, working in close coordination with our allies and our partners and all those who have an interest in ensuring stability in the region.
Secretary Blinken, who is with me today, met this morning with our NATO allies in consultation about the way forward so that Afghanistan cannot be used as ain the future as a terrorist base of attackto attack the United States or our allies.
For 20 years, Afghanistan has been a joint effort with our NATO allies. We went in together, and we're leaving together, and now we're working together to bring our people and our Afghan partners to safety.
In the past few days, I've also spoken directly with the British Prime Minster, Mr. Johnson; Chancellor Merkel of Germany; and President Macron of France. We all agreed that we should convene and we will convene the G-7 meeting next weeka group of the world's leading democraciesso that together we can coordinate our mutual approach, our united approach on Afghanistan and moving forward. We are united with our closest partners to execute the mission at hand.
We've also discussed the need to work with the international community to provide humanitarian assistance, such as food, aid, and medical care for refugees who have crossed into neighboring countries to escape the Taliban; and to bring international pressure on the Taliban with respect to the treatment of Afghanthe Afghan people overall, but including Afghan, particularly, women and girls.
The past week has been heartbreaking. We've seen gut-wrenching images of panicked people acting out of sheer desperation. You know, it's completely understandable. They're frightened, they're sad, uncertain what happens next. I don't think anyoneI don't think any one of uscan see those pictures and not feel that pain on a human level.
Now we have a mission, a mission to complete in Afghanistan. It's an incredibly difficult and dangerous operation for our military. We have almost 6,000 of America's finest fighting men and women inat the Kabul Airport. And we're putting their lives on the linethey're doing itin a dangerous place to save other Americans, our Afghan allies, and citizens of our allies who went in with us.
You know, I talk to our commanders on the ground there every single day, as I just did a few hoursan hour or so ago. And I made it clear to them that we'll get them whatever they need to do the job. They're performing to the highest standard under extraordinarily difficult and dynamic circumstances. Our NATO allies are strongly standing with us, their troops keeping sentry alongside ours in Kabul.
As is the case whenever I deploy our troops into harm's way, I take that responsibility seriously. I carry that burden every day, just as I did when I was Vice President and my son was deployed to Iraq for a year.
There'll be plenty of time to criticize and second-guess when this operation is over. But nownowI'm focused on getting this job done. I would ask every American to join me in praying for the women and men risking their lives on the ground in the service of our Nation.
As events evolve over the coming days, my team and I will continue to share the information and update the American people on exactly where things are. We'll use every resource necessary to carry out the mission at hand and bring to safety American citizens and our Afghan allies. This is our focus now.
And when this is finished, we will complete our military withdrawal and finally bring to an end 20 years of American military action in Afghanistan.
Thank you, and may God bless you, our troops, our diplomats, and all those serving in harm's way.
And now I'll take questions.
AP, Zeke Miller.
Withdrawal of U.S. Military Forces From Afghanistan/U.S. Counterterrorism Efforts 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You vowed that your election would usher in an era where the world could count on America to live up to its promises. You promised to leave Afghanistan, but you also promised not toto helpto bring out those who helped America in its war effort. We've seen these heart-wrenching images at the Kabul airport of people trying to get there, to say nothing of the people who can't get to that airport.
You made the commitment to get American troops out, to get the American citizens out. Will you make the same commitment to those who assisted in the American war effort over the last 20 years? Number one.
And then, number two: What's your message to America's partners around the world who have criticized not the withdrawal, but the conduct of that withdrawal, and made itmade them question America's credibility on the world stage?
The President. I have seen no question of our credibility from our allies around the world. I have spoken with our NATO allies. We've spoken with NATO alliesthe Secretary of State. Our National Security Adviser has been in contact with his counterparts throughout the world with our allies, as has the generalor, excuse me, I keep calling him a general, but my Secretary of Defense.
The fact of the matter is, I have not seen that. Matter of fact, the exact opposite I've gotthe exact opposite thing is, we're acting with dispatch, we're actingcommitting to what we said we would do.
Look, let's put this thing in perspective here. What interest do we have in Afghanistan at this point with Al Qaida gone? We went to Afghanistan for the express purpose of getting rid of Al Qaida in Afghanistan, as well asas well asgetting Usama bin Laden. And we did.
Imaginejust imagine if that attackif bin Laden had decided, with Al Qaida, to launch an attack from Yemen. Would we ever have gone to Afghanistan? Would there ever be any reason we'd be in Afghanistan, controlled by the Taliban? What is the national interest of United States in that circumstance? We went and did the mission. You've known my position for a long, long time. It's time to end this war.
The estimates of the cost of this war over the last 20 years ranged from a minimum of $1 trillion to a think tank at one of the universities saying $2 trillion. That's somewhere between $150 million a day and $300 million a day.
The threat from terrorism has metastasized. There's a greater danger from ISIS and Al Qaida and all these affiliates in other countries, by far, than there is from Afghanistan. And we're going to retain an over-the-horizon capability that if they were to come back, to be able to take them out, surgically move.
So this is where we should be. This is about America leading the world, and all our allies have agreed with that.
And by the way, before I made this decision, I was at the G-7, as well asmet with our NATO partners, and I told them all. Every one of them knew and agreed with the decision I made to an endendjointly end our involvement in Afghanistan.
The first part of your question wasI can't remember now.
Evacuation of Special Immigrant Visa Applicants From Afghanistan/U.S. Assistance to Afghanistan 
Q. It is: Arewould you commit to the same commitmentwould you make the same commitment to bring out Afghans who assisted in the war effort?
The President. Yes. Yes. We're making the same commitment. There's no one more important than bringing American citizens out. I acknowledge that. But they're equally important, almostis all those whothose ""SIVs,"" we call them, who, in fact, helped us. They were translators. They went into battle with us. They were part of the operation. As well as, we're also trying to get out as many NGOsnongovernmental organizationswomen's organizations, et cetera. We're doing all we can.
In the meantime, Secretary Blinken and I am going to be working with our allies to see to it that we can bring international pressure on the Taliban to bethey're looking to gain some legitimacy. They're going to have to figure out how they're going to maintain that country.
And there's going to be harsh conditions we'restrong condition we're going to apply. And it will depend on whether they get helpbased on whether or not how and well they treat women and girls, how they treat their citizens.
So this is just beginning on that score.
Q. And are you willing to stay passed the 31st to make that happento bring all the Americans out, to bring those SIVs out?
The President. I think we can get it done by then, but we're going to make that judgment as we go.
Now, Justin Sink of Bloomberg.
Afghan National Security Forces/U.S. Counterterrorism Efforts/U.S. Intelligence Gathering 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You just said that you would keep a laser focus on counterterrorism efforts and that you don't see as great of a threat of terrorism from Afghanistan as other parts of the world. But if you and your administration so badly misassessed how quickly the Taliban would sweep through Afghanistan and we no longer have an Embassy there from which to run intelligence operations, how can you at all be confident of your assessment of the risk of terrorism and the ability of the U.S. to conduct over-the-horizon missions to keep it in check? Can you tell Americans that they're safe and will remain safe from terror attacks in Afghanistan?
The President. I think you're comparing apples and oranges. One question was whether or not the Afghan forces we trained up would stay and fight in their own civil war they had going on.
No oneI shouldn't say ""no one""the consensus was that it was highly unlikely that in 11 days they'd collapse and fall, and the leader of Afghanistan would flee the country.
That's a very different question than whether or not there is the ability to observe whether or not large groups of terrorists began to accumulate in a particular area in Afghanistan to plot against the United States of America. That's why we retained an over-the-horizon capability to go in and do something about that if that occursif that occurs.
But in the meantime, we know what's happened around the world. We know what's happening in terms of what's going on in other countries, where there is the significant rise of terrorist organizations in the Middle East, in East Africa, and other places.
And so the bottom line is, we have to dowe're dealing with those terrorist threats from other parts of the world in failed states without permanent military presence there. We have to do the same in Afghanistan.
Timeline for the Withdrawal of U.S. Military Forces From Afghanistan 
Q. And, sir, just on that initial assessment: We've learned, over the last 24 hours, that there was a dissent cable from the State Department
The President. Sure.
Q. saying that the Taliban would come faster through Afghanistan. Can you say why, after that cable was issued, the U.S. didn't do more to get Americans out?
The President. We've got all kind of cables, all kinds of advice. If you notice, it ranged from this group saying thatthey didn't say it'd fall when it would fallwhen it did fallbut saying that it would fall; to others saying it wouldn't happen for a long time and they'd be able to sustain themselves through the end of the year.
I made the decision. The buck stops with me. I took the consensus opinion. The consensus opinion was that, in fact, it would not occur, if it occurred, until later in the year. So it was my decision.
Now, myI've gotmy next is Stephanie Ramos, ABC.
Evacuation of U.S. Citizens From Afghanistan 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Two questions for you. The military has secured the airport, as you mentioned, but will you sign off on sending U.S. troops into Kabul to evacuate Americans who haven't been able to get to the airport safely?
The President. We have no indication that they haven't been able to getin Kabulthrough the airport. We've made an agreement with thewith the Taliban. Thus far, they've allowed them to go through. It's in their interest for them to go through. So we know of no circumstance where American citizens arecarrying an American passportare trying to get through to the airport. But we will do whatever needs to be done to see to it they get to the airport.
Thank you.
Evacuation of Special Immigrant Visa Applicants From Afghanistan 
Q. And one more, Mr. President. Last month, my colleague Martha Raddatz interviewed Abdul, an interpreter who was on the frontlines with U.S. forces in Afghanistan. Overnight, we received a photo of Taliban militants coming to the door of his home, literally hunting him down. Thankfully, he was able to escape, but he is obviously still in mortal danger. What would be your message to Abdul, his wife, and his three young daughters?
The President. We want you to be able to get to the airport. Contact us. We'll see whatever we can do to get you there. We've got to get you out. We are committed to deal with you, your wife, and your childto get all three of you out of Afghanistan. That's the commitment.
Q. Thank you, sir.
The President. Meredith Lee of PBS NewsHour.
U.S. Evacuation Efforts From Kabul, Afghanistan/Taliban/Withdrawal of U.S. Military Forces From Afghanistan 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You mentioned just now using every resource available for evacuations. Why haven't you ordered the military to expand the security perimeter around the Kabul airport? Do you have any plans to do so, given that it will likely require more U.S. troops? And are you considering rescue operations to recover Americans and Afghan allies stuck behind Taliban checkpoints?
The President. The last answer is yesto the last question. We're considering every opportunity and every means by which we can get folks to the airport. That's number one.
Number two, the reason why we have not gone out and startedand set up a perimeter way outside the airport in Kabul is that it's likely to draw an awful lot of unintended consequences in terms of people who, in fact, are not part of the Taliban.
We've been in constant contact with the Taliban leadership on the ground in Kabul, as well as the Taliban leadership at Daho [Doha],* and we've been coordinating what we are doing.
That's why we were ablefor example, how we got all of our Embassy personnel out, how we got everyone out of the Embassy safely that was at distance. That's how we helped get the French out andout of their Embassy.
So the question remainsthere will be judgments made on the ground by the military commanders at the moment, and thatI cannot second-guess each of those judgments to be made.
But the idea ofagain, let me get back to the fundamental point I made at the outset. When the decision was made by me thatand it was made some time ago, when I ran for President saying I wanted to get us out of Afghanistanone of the things that is a reality is, people now say to me and to othersand many of you say it on airthat: Why did we have to move? Because no Americans are being attacked. Why did we withdraw thosewhy did we agree to withdraw 2,500 troops? No Americans were being attacked.
As I said before, the reason they weren't being attacked was part of an agreement that Trump had made a year earlier. ""We will leave by May 1,"" he said, ""as long as there's no attack on Americans in that year, period."" Number one.
Number two, the Taliban was taking large swaths of the countryside, north and southnone of the major areas, none of the major points of the capitals of each of these provinces, but they were all over the country.
And the idea that if I had said on May the 2d or 3d, ""We are not leaving; we are staying""does anybody truly believe that I would not have had to put in significantly more American forcessend your sons, your daughterslike my son was sent to Iraqto maybe die? And for what? For what?
So the only rational thing to do, in my view, was to set up and preposition American forces for the purpose of evacuation, and the aircraftto preposition those ahead of time so that we would be able to begin the process of evacuation of American citizens, SIVs, and others who helped us.
The last point I'll make is this: Look, if we had decided 15 years ago to leave Afghanistan, it would have been really difficult. If we decided 5 years agoif we startif we continued the war for another decade and tried to leave, there's no way in which you'd be able to leave Afghanistan without there being some of what you're seeing now.
But what we've done so far is, we've been able to get a large number of Americans out, all our personnel at the Embassy out, and so on. And thank God, so farknock on woodwe're in a different position.
Scott Detrow. Scott. NPR.
Evacuation of U.S. Citizens From Afghanistan/Taliban Cooperation 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I just want to follow up on something you said a moment ago. You said that there's no circumstances where American citizens cannot get to the airport. That doesn't really square with the images we're seeing around the airport and with the reporting on the ground from our colleagues who are describing chaos and violence. Are you saying unequivocally that any American who wants to get to the airport is getting there and getting past the security barrier and to the planes where they want to go?
The President. No, I thought the question was: How can they get through to the airport outside the airport? And the answer is: To the best of our knowledge, the Taliban checkpointsthey are letting through people showing American passports.
Now, that's a different question when they get into the rush and crowd of all the folks just outside the wall near the airport. That's why we had to, I guesswas it yesterday or the day before?we went over the wall and brought in, how many?
National Security Adviser Jacob J. Sullivan. A hundred and sixty-nine.
The President. A hundred and sixty-nine Americans. So it is a process to try to figure out how we deal with the mad rush of non-Americansthose who didn't help, those who are not on a priority list, just any Afghanany Afghanto be able to get out of the country.
And so my guess is that, no matter what, under what circumstances weanyonethere's not a whole lot of Afghanisthere's a whole lot of Afghanis that just as soon come to America, whether there were any involvement with the United States in the past at all, rather than stay under Taliban rule or any rule.
So what I was saying is that we have an agreement that they will let pass through the checkpoints that theythe Talibancontrol. They've let Americans through.
Taliban/Afghan National Security Forces 
Q. But given thisgiven the negotiations with the Taliban, the scenes that we're seeing, can you just fully explain why the plan wasn't to go ahead with these evacuations of both Americans and allies before the drawdowns began, before Bagram was closed, looking back several months? Because whether it was now or several months from now, there seems to be a broad consensus that the Taliban would make these gains and these would be needed at some point.
The President. Well, yes, at some point. But the point was that although we were in contact with the Taliban and Doha for this whole period of time, that ""some point"" wasn't expected to be the total demise of the Afghan National Force, which was 300 [thousand]* persons.
Let's assume the Afghan National Force had continued to fight and hadand they were surrounding Kabul. It'd be a very different story. Very different story.
But the overwhelming consensus was that theythis was notthey were not going to collapse. The Afghan forces, they were not going to leave. They were not going to just abandon and then put down their arms and take off. So that's what's happened.
Thank you very, very much. Thank you.
[At this point, several reporters began speaking at once.]
Q. Why do you continue to trust the Taliban?

2021-08-18 00:00:00,Remarks on the COVID-19 Response and National Vaccination Efforts,"
Good afternoon. I'd like to make an important announcement today in our work to get every American vaccinated and protected from the Delta virusthe Delta variant of COVID-19.
I just got a lengthy briefing from my COVID team, and here's the latest data that confirms we're still in a pandemic of the unvaccinated. While we're starting to see initial signs that cases may be declining in a few places, cases are still rising, especially among the unvaccinated. There are still 85 million Americans who are eligible to get vaccinated who remain unvaccinated and at real risk.
Across the country, virtually all of the COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths continue to be among the unvaccinated. In Alabama, more than 90 percent of the current hospitalizations are among the unvaccinated. In Texas, 95 percent of those in hospitals are unvaccinated. Right now it's worse in States where overall vaccination rates are low.
But let me be clear: Even in States where the vaccination rate is high, the unvaccinated in those States are also at risk, and we're seeing cases rise as a result. Quite frankly, it's a tragedy. There are people who are dying and who will die who didn't have to. So please, if you haven't gotten vaccinated, do it now. Do it now. It could save your life, and it could save the lives of those you love.
You know, and the good news is that more people are getting vaccinated. Overall, weekly, new vaccinations are up more than 80 percent from where they were a month ago. While it can take up to 6 weeks to get fully protected after your first shot, this increased level of vaccination is going to provide results in the weeks ahead.
Just remember, we have two keyand two key ways of protecting ourselves against COVID-19: one: safe, free, and effective vaccines; and two, masks. Vaccines are the best defense, but masks are extremely helpful as well.
And for those who aren't eligible for the vaccine yetchildren under the age of 12masks are the best available protection for them and the adults around them. That's why we need to make sure children are wearing masks in school.
Before I talk about the news related to vaccines, let me say a few words about masks and our children. Unfortunately, as we've seen throughout this pandemic, some politicians are trying to turn public safety measuresthat is, children wearing masks in schoolinto political disputes for their own political gain. Some are even trying to take power away from local educators by banning masks in school. They're setting a dangerous tone.
For example, last week, at a school board meeting in Tennessee, protesters threatened doctors and nurses who were testifying, making the case for masking children in schools. The intimidation and the threats we're seeing across the country are wrong. They're unacceptable.
And I've said before, this isn't about politics. It's about keeping our children safe. This is about taking on the virus together, united. I've made it clear that I'll stand with those who are trying to do the right thing.
Last week, I called school superintendents in Florida and Arizona to thank them for doing the right thing and requiring masks in their schools. One of them said, ""We teach science, so we follow the science."" The other said they have a guiding principle: ""Students first."" I couldn't agree with more thanI just couldn't agree more with what they both said.
And that's why today I am directing the Secretary of Educationan educator himselfto take additional steps to protect our children. This includes using all of his oversights authorities and legal actions, if appropriate, against Governors who are trying to block and intimidate local school officials and educators.
And I've saidas I've said before, if you aren't going to fight COVID-19, at least get out of the way of everyone else who is trying. You know, we're not going to sit by as Governors try to block and intimidate educators protecting our children. For example, if a Governor wants to cut the pay of a hard-working education leader who requires masks in the classroom, the money from the American Rescue Plan can be used to pay that person's salary, 100 percent.
I'm going to say a lot more about children and schools next week. But as we head into the school year, remember this: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC, says masks are critical, especially for those who are not yet vaccinated, like our children under the age of 12.
So let's put politics aside. Let's follow the educators and the scientists who know a lot more about how to teach our children and keep them safe than any politician. This administration is always going to take the side of our children.
Next, I want to talk to those whoof you who can get vaccinated, but you haven't. The Delta variant is twice as transmissible as the Alpha variant. It's dangerous, and it continues to spread. Vaccines are the key to stopping it, and we're making progress.
Today, more than 90 percent of seniors have at least had one shot, and 70 percent of people over the age 12 have gotten their first shot as well. That's good news, but we need to go faster.
That's why I'm taking steps on vaccination requirements where I can. Already, I've outlined vaccine requirements. We're going reach millions of Americans: Federal workers and contractors; medical staff caring for our veterans at VA hospitals; and our Active Duty military, Reservists, and National Guard.
Today I'm announcing a new step. If you work in a nursing home and serve people on Medicare or Medicaid, you will also be required to get vaccinated. More than 130,000 residents in nursing homes havesadly, over the period of this viruspassed away.
At the same time, vaccination rates among nursing home staff significantly trail the rest of the country. The studies show that highly vaccinated nursing home staffs is associated with at least 30-percent less COVID-19 cases among long-term care residents.
With this announcement, I'm using the power of the Federal Government, as a payer of health care costs, to ensure we reduce those risks to our most vulnerable seniors. These steps are all about keeping people safe and out of harm's way.
If you walk into a Government office building, you should know that Federal workers are doing everything possible to keep you safe. If you're a veteran seeking care at a VA hospital, you should not be at a greater risk walking into the hospital than you were outside the hospital. And now, if you visit, live, or work in a nursing home, you should not be at a high risk for contracting COVID from unvaccinated employees.
While I'm mindful that my authority at the Federal level is limited, I'm going to continue to look for ways to keep people safe and increase vaccination rates.
And I'm pleased to see the private sector stepping up as well. In the last week, AT&T, Amtrak, McDonalds, they all announced vaccine requirements. I recently met with a group of business and education leadersfrom United Airlines, to Kaiser Permanente, to Howard Universitywho are also doing the same thing.
Over 200 health systems, more than 50 in the past 2 weeks, have announced vaccine requirements. Colleges and universities are requiring more than 5 million students to be vaccinated as they return to classes this fall. All of this makes a difference.
The Wall Street Journal reported the share of job postings stating that new hires must be vaccinated has nearly doubled in the past month. Governors and mayors in California, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Oregon, and Washington have all announced vaccination requirements.
So let's be clear: Vaccination requirements have been around for decades. Students, health care professionals, our troops are typically required to receive vaccines to prevent everything from polio to smallpox to measles to mumps to rubella.
In fact, the reason most people in America don't worry about polio, smallpox, measles, mumps, and rubella today is because of vaccines. It only makes sense to require a vaccine that stops the spread of COVID-19.
And it's time for others to step up. Employers have more power today to end this pandemic than they have ever had before. My message is simple: Do the right thing for your employees, consumers, and your businesses. Let's remember: The key tool to keeping our economy going strong is to get people vaccinated and at work.
I know that I'll have your backthey should know I'll have their back, as I have the back of the States trying to do the right thing as well. For example, yesterday I instructed the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, to extend full reimbursement through the end of the year to State developmentsto State deployments of National Guard in support of COVID-19 response.
Nearly 18,000 National Guard members are supporting our response nationwide, from caring for patients, to administering vaccines, to running testing sites, to distributing supplies. As the States continue to recover from the economic toll left by COVID-19, the full reimbursement of National Guard services during this pandemic will be another tool that will help them shore up their budgets, meet the needs of their communities, and continue our economic recovery.
These are the latest steps we're taking to get more people vaccinated.
Next, I want to speak to you allall of you who are vaccinated. How should you be thinking about the moment we're in? First, know that you're highly protected against severe illness and death from COVID-19. Only a small fraction of people going to the hospital today are those who have been vaccinated. But we have a responsibility to give the maximum amount of protectionall of you the maximum amount.
Earlier today our medical experts announced a plan for booster shots to every fully vaccinated Americanadult American. You know, this shot will boost your immune response. It will increase your protection from COVID-19. And it's the best way to protect ourselves from new variants that could arise.
The plan is for every adult to get a booster shot 8 months after you got your second shot. Pending approval from the Food and Drug Administration and the CDC's committee of outside experts, we'll be ready to start these boosterthis booster program during the week of September 20, in which time anyone vaccinated on or before January 20 will be eligible to get a booster shot.
So that means that if you got your second shot on February 15, you're eligible to get your booster shot on October 15. If you got your second shot on March 15, go for your booster starting on November 15. And so on. Just remember, as a simple rulerule: Eight months after your second shot, get a booster shot.
And these booster shots are free. We'd be able to get the booster shots at any one of the approximately 80,000 vaccination locations nationwide. It will be easy. Just show your vaccination card, and you'll get a booster. No other ID. No insurance. No State residency requirement.
My administration has been planning for this possibility and this scenario for months. We purchased enough vaccine and vaccine supplies so that when your 8-month mark comes up, you'll be ready to get your vaccination freethat booster shot free. And we have it available.
It will make you safer and for longer. And it will help us end the pandemic faster.
Now, I know there are some world leaders who say Americans shouldn't get a third shot until other countries got their first shot. I disagree. We can take care of America and help the world at the same time.
In June and July, America administered 50 million shots here in the United States, and we donated 100 million shots to other countries. That means that America has donated more vaccine to other countries than every other country in the world combined.
During the coming months of fall and early winter, we expect to give out anotherabout 100 thousand [million]* boosters, and the United States will donate more than 200 million additional doses to other countries. This will keep us on our way to meeting our pledge of more than 600 million vaccine donationsover half a billion. And I saidas I said before, we're going to be the arsenal of vaccines to beat this pandemic as we were the arsenal of democracy to win World War II.
So let me conclude with this: The threat of the Delta virus remains real. But we are prepared. We have the tools. We can do this. To all those of who are unvaccinated: Please get vaccinated for yourself and for your loved ones, your neighborhood and for your community.
And to the rest of America, this is no time to let our guard down. We just need to finish the job with science, with facts, and with confidence. And together, as the United States of America, we'll get this done.
God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you.

2021-07-02 00:00:00,Remarks on the National Economy and an Exchange With Reporters,"
The President. Good morning, everyone. It is a good morning. [Laughter] It's a good morning. As we get prepared to celebrate Independence Day, today's job news brought us something else to celebrate. This morning we learned that, in June, our economy created 850,000 jobs. Eight hundred and fifty thousand jobs. Wages went up for American workers.
Since I took office, our recovery [economy]* has created an average of 600,000 dollarsix""dollars."" [Laughter] I wish theythey probably wish there was 600,000 jobs that paid $600,000 a year. But 600,000 jobs per month. We have now created over 3 million jobs since I took office, more jobs than have ever been created in the first 5 months of any Presidency in modern history, thanks to the incredible work of the entire team.
This is historic progress, pulling our economy out of the worst crisis in a hundred years, driven in part by our dramatic progress in vaccinating our Nation and beating back the pandemic, as well as other elements of the American Rescue Plan.
Today, the U.S. is the only major advanced economy where the OECD projections of future output are higher today than they were in January 2020, before the pandemic hit. And America was ranked first in Bloomberg's ""COVID Resilience Ranking."" None of this happened by accident. Again, it's a direct result of the American Rescue Plan. And at the time, people questioned whether or not we should do that, even though we didn't have bipartisan support. Well, it worked.
In February, the Congressional Budget Office projected 2021 economic growth would be 3.7 percent. Yesterday they doubled that number to 7.4 percent, in large part thanks to the American Rescue Plan and our work to defeat the virus.
The last time the economy grew at this rate was in 1984, and Ronald Reagan was telling us it's ""morning in America."" Well, it's getting close to afternoon here. The sun is coming out. At the time, the CBO revised their long-run deficit projections down as a share of GDP theyas they just have done.
So the American Rescue Plan is strengthening our financial position, and it grows our economy. It's continuing to grow our economy. And the strength of our recovery is helping us flip the script.
Instead of workers competing with each other for jobs that are scarce, employers are competing with each other to attract workers. That kind of competition in the market doesn't just give workers more ability to earn higher wages, it also gives them the power to demand to be treated with dignity and respect in the workplace.
More jobs, better wages, that's a good combination. Put simply: Our economy is on the move, and we have COVID-19 on the run. Yes, we have more work to do to get America vaccinated and everyone back to work. We're aiming for full employment, and that means keeping our pace on jobs growth, including for Black, Hispanic, and Asian workers.
But this progress is testament to our commitment to grow this economy from the bottom up and the middle out. The American Rescue Plan provided resources to get shots in people's arms and checks in people's pockets. Schoolsschools are struggling to reopen so we made vaccinating teachers a priority, getting schools much-needed support. In March, we've addedjust in the month of [since]* March, we added 364,000 education jobs and roles. Small businesses and restaurants were getting crushed. Now we're delivering the loans and support they need to reopen and to stay open.
This morning we've learned that jobs in some hard-hit sectorssuch as restaurants, hotels, amusement parkswere up by 343,000 last month; over 1.5 million over the past 5 months. And more help is on the way to give families just a little bit more breathing room.
Starting this month, families are going to receiving one of the largest ever, single-year tax cuts that middle class families have ever received, and it's called the childcare tax credit. And here's how it works: In the past, if you paid taxes and had a good income, you could deduct $2,000 per child, and that would come off the total amount of taxes you owe. If you had two children, you owed $10,000; you take off $4,000.
In the American Rescue Plan, we expanded that. Now a parent would get $3,600 for each child under the age of 6 and $3,000 for dependents they had between the ages of 6 and 17. So instead of just being a credit against your taxes you owe, it's now a fully refundable credit, half of which will get paid out in monthly basis.
Look, what that means is: This year, middle class families with two young children can expect to getreceive a$7,200 in a rebate, in effecta tax returnwith the monthly payments of $600 a month starting this month, until it's paid out. Eight out of every ten families who use direct deposit will get their refunds. They'll be able to get a monthly payment on the 15th of every month from now until the end of the year, so they get that paid out. Help with families most need itmost need help to make ends meet. It's important.
And I've said it for a long time: It's time to give ordinary folks, ordinary Americans, middle class and working class Americans a tax break. This is the type of tax cut that can help our economy because it will go to families who are going to spend it.
It will also help lead a historic reduction in child povertyexcuse me
[At this point, the President took a drink of water.]
historic reduction in child poverty, which would have long-term benefits for our economy.
And we're delivering $39 billion to help childcare providers serve more families, to help parents, particularly women, get back to work. Last month, our economy added nearly 25,000 childcare jobs. Again, none of this happened by accident. We're providingproving to the naysayers and the doubters that they were wrong.
None of this is guaranteed to continue, though, unless we finish our work. Now is the time to accelerate the progress we've been making. Now is the time to build in long-term foundation that we've laid and build it in for a long term. Economists of all stripes agree that my plan will create good jobs and drastically strengthen our economy in the long run.
So we have to continue to make the investments that will allow our economy to build back better and deal everyone in. We took a significant step in that direction last week when the bipartisan group of Senators forged an agreement with me to move forward on key portions of my American Jobs Plan.
It wasI just in Wisconsin, where I highlighted how this agreement is going to pave the way for a generational investment to modernize our infrastructure; create millions of jobs, according to the experts; and what that will mean an everand it won't just be in the center cities. It will be every corner of the State and our Nation.
We're going to create jobs repairing roads and bridges, replacing a hundred percent of our Nation's lead water pipes, making our power grid more reliable, delivering high-speed internet to every American home, rural and urban. We're going to put people to work building a nationwide electric vehicle charging network, transitioning from diesel school buses and transit buses to electric buses, and bringing in world-class rail service to more Americans by reducingand, in the process, reduce our carbon footprint.
For example, when I was up in Wisconsin, I saidI pointed outthe Governor was there. I said, ""Gov, I know it takes""or I don't know how many peoplea couple hundred people, I guess, in the audience. I said: ""It takes, they tell me, 4 hours to drive from here to Chicago. With the money we have infor mass transit here, weyou're going to be able to do that in 2 hours."" And all the data shows that when it's easier to get someplace by rail than by automobile, it's cheaper, and it generates a whole lot less carbon footprint.
We're going to create good-paying union jobs capping hundreds of thousands of abandoned oil and gas wells to stop methane leaks, which are devastating, and to protect the health of our communities. These are good jobs. Taken together, these investments are going to position America to compete with the world and win the 21st century.
You know, as we bring home key parts of my American Jobs Plan, I'm going to make the case for equally critical investments that we still need, including those in which I introduced at the same time: my Americans' Family Plan.
When I was running for President, I put together a bold, aggressive plan to deliver childcare, paid leave, universal pre-K for 3- and 4-year-olds, free community college. Maybe the most important among them was extending the expanded childcare tax credit I just mentioned for another 5 years, which will significantly benefit middle class and working class families.
That human infrastructure is as essential as our physical infrastructure. It's going to help us create more good jobs, ease the burden on working families, and strengthen our economystrengthen it in the long run.
These investments are critical. And as the plans I put forward tackle our climate crisis, which are broad and deep, I'm going to fight to see them enacted and signed into law. We have a chance to seize this economic momentum of the first months of my administration, not just to build back, but as I've been saying, ""build back better.""
This is much alreadythis much is already clear: We're on track, and we're on the right track. Our plan is working. And we're not going to let up now.
So I want to thank everyone. I wish you all a happy Fourth of July. We're going to be able to go to ballgames. You're going to be able to sit in the stadiums. You're going to be able to be with your families in backyard barbeques, as we hoped. And we're going to make more progress.
So God bless America, and may God protect our troops.
Q. Mr. President
U.S. Troop Drawdown in Afghanistan/Reconciliation Efforts 
Q. Could you talk to us about Afghanistan? Is the drawdown going to be done in the next few days?
The President. No.
Q. No?
The President. No, we're onwe're on track exactly as to where we expected to be. But we justI wanted to make sure there was enough, quote, ""running room"" that we could getwouldn't be able to do it all until September. There will still be some forces left. But it's a rational drawdown with our allies, and it's makingso there's nothing unusual about it.
Q. Are you concerned that 
Q. Are you worried that the Afghan Government might fall? I mean, we are hearing about how the Taliban is taking more and more districts.
The President. Look, we were in that war for 20 years. Twenty years. And I thinkI met with the Afghan Government here in the White House, in the Oval. I think they have the capacity to be able to sustain the government. There are going to have to be, down the road, more negotiations, I suspect. But I am concerned that they deal with the internal issues that they have to be able to generate the kind of support they need nationwide to maintain the Government.
U.S. Military Support Role in Afghanistan 
Q. A follow on that thought on Afghanistan
The President. I want to talk about happy things, man. [Laughter]
Q. If there is evidence that Kabul is threatened, which some of the intelligence reports have suggested it could be in 6 months or thereabout, do you think you've got the capability to help provide any kind of air support, military support to them to keep the capital safe, even if the U.S. troops are obviously fully out by that time?
The President. We have worked out an over-the-horizon capacity that we can be value added, but the Afghans are going to have to be able to do it themselves with the Air Force they have, which we're helping them maintain.
Q. Sir, on Afghanistan
The President. I'm not going to answer any more quick questions on Afghanistan.
Q. Are you concerned
The President. Look, it's Fourth of July.
National Economy/Coronavirus Containment Efforts 
Q. On the economy
Q. Are you concerned about Fourth of July gatherings
The President. I'm concerned that you guys are asking me questions that I'll answer next week. But I'mthis is a holiday weekend. I'm going to celebrate it. There is great things happening.
The economy is growing faster than any time in 40 years. We've got a record number of new jobs. COVID deaths are down 90 percent. Wages are up faster than any time in 15 years. We're bringing outbringing our troops home. We haveall across America, people are going to ballgames and doing good things. This is a goodI'll beI'll answer all your negative questionsnot negativeyour legitimate question.
Coronavirus Containment Efforts/Coronavirus Variant Strains/National Vaccination Efforts 
Q. But with the gatherings, are you concerned that there is a potential, this weekend, in places where vaccination levels are not particularly high, that there will be new COVID outbreaks in various regions of the country?
The President. I am concerned that people who have not gotten vaccinated have the capacity to catch the variant and spread the variant to other people who have not been vaccinated.
I am not concerned there is going to be a major outbreak, in other words, that we're going to have another epidemic nationwide, but I am concerned lives will be lost. And I was even reading today there's some speculation and some judgment that's coming out that you may be able to even communicate the vaccinethe new variant to your pets.
So I say, not totally facetiously, for those of you who haven't been vaccinated because you don'tyou don't think it'syou want to go through it: It doesn't hurt, it's accessible, it's free, it's available. And not onlydon't think about yourself; think about your family. Think about those around you. That's what we should be thinking about today.
The Fourth of July this year is different than the Fourth of July last year. And it's going to be better next year.
Thank you all.
The President's Agenda 
Q. Mr. President, do you think that Congress will enact your plans? Are you confident
The President. Yes.
Q. that you're going to get it done? [Laughter] Come on.
The President. Come on, guys. Am I confidentare youhave you ever been confident about anything with guarantee? Who wants to put money on anything that Congress is going to do? Look, folks, this is a process. This is a process.
I love you guys, but it's a process. And I don'tyou want me to say, ""Yes, I'm absolutely certain."" Well, are you absolutely certain this new commission is going to work, investigating what happened on the 6th? Are you guys confident that Republicans are going to participate?
Look, all I knowonly thing I know what to doand I really mean thisis do my best to lay out what I think the country has to do, try to be as persuasive as I can, and hope. And thus far, you know, it'syou know, it seems to be working a little bit. So thank you.
Q. Mr. President, Mr. President, do you think it's fair that the Olympic runner

2021-07-01 00:00:00,"Remarks on the Surfside Residential Building Collapse and an Exchange With Reporters in Miami Beach, Florida","
The President. Good afternoon, folks. Let me begin by saying that the degree of cooperation between local, State, and Federal officials down here has been remarkable.
I want to thank our FEMA Director for leading this national effort. But Governor DeSantis, Senators Rubio and Scott, Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, and Mayor CavaCavathey've beenthey've all cooperated in ways that I haven't seen in a long time. And it's really a testament to what'show difficult things are down here. And it's what, quite frankly, we miss a lot. You know, we allwe've all been working in tandem from the moment we got the news of the collapse of the building.
And I think my colleagues will tell you we cut through the bureaucracy. The one order I gave the Federal folks was: ""No bureaucracy. Just cut through it. Get to whatever they need."" That's why we've decided to cover, for example, 100 percent of the search-and-rescue costs for the first 30 days. Not done often, but necessary here, in my view.
And FEMA is going to provide temporary housing and other urgent needs for the survivors. The State Department is expediting visas for family members from other countries, and there are from Latin America, South America, Europe, Israel.
And I want to give a special shout-out to the first respondersInternational Association of Firefighters, one of the best organizations in the country. And I particularly want to thank the president. Ed came down from Boston, and he's here with the entire group.
You know, these folks arethese folks are always showing up, no matter what. They're risking their lives. You know, there's that old expression. I know, the press that travels with me is tired of hearing me saying it, but I'm not tired of saying it. And that isthat old expression""God made man. Then, he made a few firefighters."" They're remarkable, remarkable people. There's alwaysthey're always risking their lives to save lives, as well as the police and other first responders. I got to meet with a whole bunch of them.
And we are able to deploy nearly 500 personnel, including five other search-and-rescue teams on the ground today here because ofour FEMA Director ordered it. I want to compliment FEMA and, I might add, all those folks who are risking their lives to save lives, but also holding out hope that others will be found. Hope springs eternal.
When I talked to those first responders, I pointed out that they're under a great deal of stress and we should take advantagethey should take advantage of the mental health facilities that are going to be available. Because, you know, we talk about our military suffering from posttraumatic stress. Well, seeing what they're seeing and doing what they're doing, understanding how much trauma is involved, theyI just don't want them thinking that they should walk away from help if it's needed. You know, they stand together, and it's really impressive.
And there's also the need, in addition to State and local assistance, to determine the cause of this collapse and the adjacent buildings, how safe they are. There are two outstanding concerns. First, the remaining buildings may collapsethe remainder of the building may collapse. We need to determine if it's safe for first responders to return to the site to continue their rescue mission.
That's being done right now. And that's why I asked the National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST, to investigate, to see if it's safe to go back and what caused the building to collapse in the first place. Because we're committed not only to recover, but to restore the safety across the board.
But the other reason I came down was to meet with the families. The whole Nation is mourning with these families. They see it every day on television. They're going through hell. And those who survived the collapse, as well as those who are missing loved ones.
I realize I'm a little late because I spent a lot of time with the familiesa whole lot of time. And I apologize for taking so long to get here, because I thought it was important to speak to every single person who wanted to speak to me. So, after what you all covered when I opened up the meeting, I spent the remainder of the time, and Iand such incredible people.
I sat with one woman who had just lost her husband and her little baby boy; didn't know what to do. I sat with another family that lost almost the entire family: cousins, brothers, sisters. And to watch them and tothey're praying and pleading that: ""God, let there be a miracle. Let them be something happen for me that's good.""
Because I have, like many of you do, some idea what it's like to suffer that kind of loss so many of them are suffering. You know, they had basic heart-wrenching questions: ""Will I be able to recover the body of my son or daughter, my husband, my cousin, my mom and dad? How can I have closure without being able to bury them if I don't get the body? What do I do?""
Jill and I wanted them to know that we're with them and the country is with them. Our message today is that we're here for you, as one Nationas one Nation. And that's the message we communicated. We'll be in touch with a lot of these families continuing through this process. But there is much more to be done. We're ready to do it.
And again, I thank the Governor, I thank my colleagues, mySenator Scott and Senator Rubio, I thank Debbie Wasserman Schultz for their total, complete cooperation. There's nothere's no disagreement, no bickering. Everybody is on the same team. It's what America is all about. It's about pulling together, leaving nobody behind. And that's what made me feelthe one thing that made me feel good about this is theis a cohesion that exists. There's no Democrat or Republican out there; they're just people wanting to do the right thing for their fellow Americans.
So may God bless the victims and their families, and may God protect our first responders.
And I'll take a couple questions right now.
Search-and-Rescue Efforts at the Champlain Towers South Condominium Building in Surfside, Florida 
Q. Mr. President, what were you told today about the likelihoodyou said, ""Hope springs eternal""but that somebody will be able to be pulled out alive from this? And what were you able to convey to the families about that possibility?
The President. Well, look, first of all, the families are very realistic. They know the longer it goesand one of the things that the local FEMA personnel as well as the local first responders did is, they took all of the families to the site to see: to see what it looked like up close. And they're all realists. They all look, and they see those floors just literally feetcement upon cement upon cement.
You know, Iwhen I talked to some of the families, some of the people who did escape, survived, got out, they talked about watching the building collapse and watching as they were in the garageone floor come downliterally a whole floor on top of another floor. They know that the chances are, as each day goes by, diminished slightly.
But at a minimumat a minimumthey want to recover the bodies. They want to recover the bodies. There's a lot of very religious people who are in there. Members of thethe rabbis in the Jewish community were talking about the need to make sure that they recover the body and be able to bury them. Give themand you know, theanyway.
So I think they're very realistic, Mike [Mike Memoli, NBC News]. But I don't think that that, in any way, suggests that it's toothat we should stop. I think that we should move on, continue to try to recover the bodies.
In the meantime, that's why NIST and others are determining whether or not it's safe to send the first responders back. When they'd asked me about this, I'd point out that the last thing they would want and we would want is, in the process of trying to recoverand the possibilitythere's still a possibility someone could be alive, someone could still be breathing, someone could be therethat the last thing you want to have happen is have that building collapse and kill 10, 20, 30, 50 firefighters or wound them, or first responders.
Sobut Mike, they'reyou know, they're realistic. Iit just brought back so manyso many memories. It's bad enoughit's bad enoughto lose somebody. But the hard partthe really hard partis to not know whether they're surviving or not, just not have any idea.
When the accident took my wife and my family, the hardest part was: Were my boys going to get out? Are they going to make it? And not knowing. Not knowing, when you're flying home from Washington to get the news. You know, you just don't know. So it'sbut I was amazedas you know, unfortunately, I've done a lot of these circumstances where I've met with families who have had great loss. And what amazed me about this group of people was the resilience and their absolute commitment, their willingness to do whatever it took to findto find an answer. I walked away impressed by their strength.
Andand Nancy [Nancy Cook], Bloomberg, do you have a question?
Q. Yes
The President. I was told.
Collapse of the Champlain Towers South Condominium Building in Surfside, Florida/Climate Change and Rising Sea Levels 
Q. Oh, thank you. Yes. What did you learn, if anything, about the collapse of the building? Is there anything more you learned from investigators or the FEMA Administrators today?
The President. No, it's underway. I don'tand the Director of FEMA is with me here. We don't have any firm proof of what's happened. There's all kinds of rational speculation about whether or not the rebars arewere rusted; whether or not the cementwhether it was limestone or not; whether or notbut a lot of the families who survived talked about how upset they were that, in the last years that they've been here, how there was one condominium complex built across the street, and a road was purchased. And while they were living there, they would hear the drilling, and they'd feel their building moving and shaking.
There are all kinds of discussions about whether or not they thought that water level risingwhat impact it had. And interesting to meI didn't raise itbut how many of the survivors and how many of the families talked about the impact of global warming. How muchand they didn't know exactly, but they talked about sea levels rising and about how there wereandand the combination of that and the concern about incoming stormsincoming tropical storms.
And sobut I don't think there is, at this point, any definitive judgment as to why it collapsed and what can be done to prevent it from happening and what other buildings may have to be inspected to determine if they have the same problems.
I'm supposed to head out and catch up with the Governor. So I want to thank you all for taking the time.
Manhattan District Attorney's Investigation of the Trump Organization/Supreme Court Decision Upholding Arizona State Voting Restrictions/Voting Rights Protections 
Q. Mr. President, can we ask you about two matters away from where we are now? The first is: While you've been speaking, a top associate of the former President has been in a New York court, pleading not guilty to various financial charges. Do you have a reaction to that?
And secondarily, if I can, does the Supreme Court's ruling today on an important voting rights decision add to the sense of urgency you feel about pursuing voting rights legislation at this time?
The President. I know nothing about the first circumstance because I've been gone. I don't have any idea, so I'm not going to comment on that. And even if I did, I wouldn't comment on an ongoing case if it's an ongoing case.
With regard to the second point: I think I did get a summary on the way down on the plane of the Supreme Court decision. It is mildly positive, in the sense that there's a remedy available based on the particular voting decision.
I think that it is critical that we make a distinction between voter suppression and suspension. The ability of a State legislative body to come along and votetheir legislaturevote to change who is declared the winner, I find to be somewhat astounding.
But the Supreme Court rule did not rule that way today, to the best of my knowledge. Andbut I'll have much more to say about that, because I plan on speaking extensively on voting rights andas well as going on the road on this issue.
So thank you all very much.

And I think there's more that we can do, includingI think I have the powerand we'll know shortly thatto be able to pick up a hundred percent of the cost for the county and the State for 30 days.
Mayor Daniella Levine Cava of Miami-Dade, Florida. Oh, my goodness, Mr. President.
The President. I think I'm quite sure I can do that. And so we're going to do that.
And there's going to be a lotyou all know it because a lot of you have been through it as wellthere's going to be a lot of pain and anxiety and suffering and even need for psychological help in the days and months that follow.
And so we're not going anywhere.
Mayor Levine Cava. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President.
The President. No, for real. But, again, I just want to, you know, start the day, if I could, but getting as thorough briefing as you're able to give me, and tell me what you need. And that goes for both the Senators and the Congresswoman and anyone in Florida, just to pick up the phone to the Oval. For real. I'm not joking about it.
And I think the Gov will tell youanything you ask for, we got. And we have another group of teams coming from FEMA today. How many people will it be?
Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Deanne Bennett Criswell. At the end of the day, there should about 500 on the ground.
The President. Five hundred on the ground.
So, again, this is your show. We just want to make sure that whatever you needand you know, includingwell, anyway, I'm talking too much. Why don't II want to hear from you guys.
Mayor Levine Cava. All right. Well, Mr. President, we cannot thank you enough for being here with us, for showing your extraordinary support from day one. You called me that morning. We hustled into a little room in the Family Reunification Center so I could take the call, and you said whatever we need. And I said, ""Bring FEMA,"" and here they are, on the ground.
[At this point, Mayor Levine Cava continued her remarks, concluding as follows.]
So Iwe have a briefing for you. And I want to start with our Governor. And I want to thank you, Governor DeSantis. Your team has been amazing, but you personally have been amazing. You've been a steady, calming, reassuring, but forceful voice every step of the way. And it's been a pleasure to partner with you, truly. Thank you. Thank you.
Governor Ronald D. DeSantis of Florida. Well, if I could
The President. Let me say just one more thing. You know what's good about thisthe way you've cooperated? We're letting the Nation know we can cooperate.
Mayor Levine Cava. Yes, sir. That's right.
The President. And when it's really important
Mayor Levine Cava. That's right.
The President. when it's really importantI was talking to Debbie about it on the way downwe come together. This is life and death.
And so I don't thinkI just got back from about 12 days in Europe. They wonder whether we can do this. And you're doing it. I mean, just the simple act of everybody doing whatever needs to be done is aand it really makes a difference, Gov.
Gov. DeSantis. Well, thank you, Mr. President. And you've recognized the severity of this tragedy from day one. And you've been very supportive.
We, in Floridayou know, you'll drive up and down these coastal roads, you'll see these buildings. And I've driven by that building, probably never thought twice. And then, something like this happens, and you recognize in each individual unit there's an amazing story.
And lives have been shattered irrevocably as a result of this. We've already identified, unfortunately, fatalitiespeople who've been 92 years old, have been a matriarch of a wonderful family. We have families with kids missing. And we even have young newlyweds who hadn't even been married a year who were in the tower when it collapsed.
And so the cooperation has been great. The localboth the municipal and the county have been fantastic. And you guys have not only been supportive at the Federal level, but we've had no bureaucracy. When we're dealing with FEMA, we're literally getting requests routed from local to State to Federal in no time
The President. I promise you, there will be none.
Gov. DeSantis. and the approval is happening. Yes.
[Gov. DeSantis continued his remarks, concluding as follows.]
But I can tell you this: We're not going to stop until we identify everybody and until we do what we need to do. So thank you, Mr. President.
Mayor Levine Cava. Thank you, Mr. President. I want to acknowledge the leadership of the First Lady, Casey DeSantis, as well, who is very, very focused on children and mental health issues and is bringing that agenda to our discussions. And of course, we've been including all of that, as you'll learn from the briefings. But we know how important First Ladies are[laughter]so we just wanted to be sure to give a shout out.
[The press was escorted out, and the briefing continued.]

2021-06-30 00:00:00,"Remarks on Signing Legislation Regarding Methane Pollution, Predatory Lending, and Employment Discrimination","
The President. Thank you. Madam Speaker, welcome to almost the other side. [Laughter] It's great to see you guys. And it's strange to have Congressmen stand up for me; that's an unusual thing to do. [Laughter] But thank you so much.
Well, welcome to the adjunct to the White House here. TheI'm about to sign into law three bills which you all have written and passed protecting our planet from climate-disturbing greenhouse gas, particularly methane, which is devastating; protecting consumers from predatory lenders; and protecting workers from employment discrimination. Each of these billseach of these billsreflects a return to common sense and commitment to the common good, and I want to thank every one of you for your leadership in getting this done.
The first bill is going to help us to drastically cut methane pollution. You may rememberand I know you all do, but to say this for the press and those listening, back when President Obama, in 2016, and I put in place a rule that required that companies capture methane leaks from the wells they were digging.
Well, guess what? They didn't. And so, since then, we've learned that methane is even more dangerous to the climate than we knew back then, in 2016trapping much more heatup to 80 times more heat, methane doesand carbonthan carbon dioxide in its first 20 years in the atmosphere.
And look, this is an important first step of cutting methane pollution. Our bipartisan infrastructure plan will include $21 billion in environmental remediation to capping millions of abandoned wells, leaking wells, and oil and gas wells. And so it will be a good step forward.
The second bill will protect borrowers against predatory lenders. In many States, these lenders are kept in check by caps on how much interest they can charge, but some loan sharks and online lenders have figured out how to get around these limits andby using a partnership with a bank to avoid the State cap and charging outrageous interest. And I'myou all have pointed outsome as high as 100-percent interest, which is astounding. And I must admit to you, I didn't know that. I was unaware they could dopull that off.
These are so called ""rent-a-bank"" schemes. And they allow lenders to prey on veterans, seniors, and other unsuspecting borrowers tapping intotrapping them into a cycle of debt. And the last administration let it happened, but we won't.
And the third bill is going to help us hold employers accountable for workplace discrimination. As a nation, we continue to strive toward realizing our founding principle that all people are created equal and have a right to full access to the American Dream, and that includes at workat work. That's why we have the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which enforces the law that makes job discrimination illegal.
The last administration put in place a rule that makes it hardermakes it harderfor those seeking redress for job discrimination to get justice. With this law, we're going to move in the direction of greater accountability, fairness, and justice.
[At this point, the President invited Members of Congress up to the signing desk and signed the bills.]

2021-06-30 00:00:00,Remarks During a Meeting With Western Governors on Wildfire Prevention and Response Efforts,"
[The President's remarked were joined in progress.] 
The President. proud of our Cabinet. And they're all here today. They all want to be engaged. They all want to help. And so, hopefully, we're going to get into some exchanges going down the line here.
I want to thank you all again for being in the support meetings. So thank you, thank you, thank you. And, Governor Newsom, you trying to make us feel bad, listening in that magnificent background you have over there[laughter]and while I'm sitting in here in the White House? God love you. Anyway, it's good to see you all, really. Thank you.
For years, the President has received a briefing at the beginning of the hurricane season, looking at the trends that are coming to get a sense of what's coming so that the country can be better prepared.
And when I received that briefing this year, I asked for a second briefing that does the same thing, but now we're doing it about wildfire season. And we know this is becoming a regular cycle, and we know it's getting worse. In fact, the threat of western wildfires this year is as severe as it's ever been.
And I wanted to convene this group of Governorsof western State Governors, key members of my Cabinet, FEMA leadership, and the leadership from utility industries, and senior members of our White House team to make sure we're doing everythingand I mean this sincerelywe're doing everything possible to help you prepare for what's coming, and some is already there.
The truth is, we're playing catch up. This is an area that has been underresourced, but that's going to change, if we have anything to do with it. We can't cut corners when it comes to managing our wildfires or supporting our firefighters. And this briefing is going to be an annual event to make sure we're focusing on preventing firesthe fire threats in the first placeas well as responding when they arise.
But right now, we have to act and act fast. We're late in the game here. We're remembering the horrific scenes from last year: orange skies that looked like end of days; smoke and ash that made the air dangerous to breathe; more than 10 million acres burned; billions of dollars in economic damage; families that lost their homes and everything they own; and too manytoo manylost lives.
And this year, wethey could be even tougher, based on the weather patterns. You know, California and some other places, the drought conditions are twice that'swhat they were last year. And right now, we're seeing record heat in Portland and across the West.
And this [last]* year, you know, 21 large, uncontained fires were burning. This year, there are 36 that are uncontained and burning. There are already about 9,000 firefighters deployed across the regionfrom California to New Mexico, to Utah and Nevadaand it's only June. I knowI realize I'm preaching to the choir here. I know you all know this better than any other people in the country.
Fire season, traditionally, lasts through October. But with climate changeclimate change driving the dangerous confluence of extreme heat and prolonged droughtwe're seeing wildfires in greater intensity that move with more speed, lastyou know, and lasts well beyond traditional monthsthe traditional months of the fire season. And that's a problem for all of us.
Wildfires are not a partisan phenomenon. They don't stop at a county or a State lineor country line, for that matter. We need a coordinated, comprehensive response with all the Federal workingall the Federal Government working in close cooperation to support you, the States. That's what this is about. We want to know what youthe States and localities and Tribal governments and those in the frontlinesare facing in this danger and what you think would help the most.
Today we're taking critical steps to help protect American communities right away. First, we're going to make sure that we have enough firefighters on call who are trained, equipped, and ready to respond for all this fire season. And we're going to pay them. TheyI mean, the idea these folks are running intoanyway, we should pay them.
Last week, I learned that some of our Federal firefighters are being paid less than $13 an hour. Come on, man. This isthat's unacceptable to me. And I immediately directed my team to take decisive action to fix it.
So today we're announcing what I still think is not enough: This year we're going to provide retention incentives that's going to ensure Federal wildland fires arefirefighters are making at least $15 an hour and provide for additional 10-percent bonuses for those working on the frontlines.
But a one-time boost is not enough. These courageous women and men take an incredible risk of running toward the fire, and they deserve to be paid and paid good wages. You know that old expression: ""God made man. Then, he made a few firefighters""? Well, it's true. They're incredible. I've spent a lot of time, my whole career, with them.
So we're going to work with Congress, and I know many of your Senators and Representatives have been working hard on this forto permanently get Federal firefighters a better deal, including improvements in their compensation, their benefits, and their work-life balance.
The Federal Government is also offering funding, when Governors request it, to train and equip National Guard members so they have athey're ready to provide a surge of firefighting capacity.
You know, one of the things I learned over the years, being so deeply involved with the firefighters, is the only thing that saves a firefighter's life is another firefighter. That's the single most consequential thing.
And you know, one of the hardest speeches I've ever had to makeand you've allwe've all made difficult speecheswas at the funeral of the 19 Granite Mountain Hotshot firefighters, when the Prescott, Arizona, Fire Department got clobbered. That tragedy happened 8 years ago today. That's the reason I mention it. It's hard to rememberof all the costs that firefighters risk when they do their job and their bravery to step up and do the job.
Now, traditionally, Federal firefighting has been a seasonal job, but because of climate changeand I know you all know it, and I hope your constituents know it: There is climate changeit's no longer a seasonal job. This is a year-round mission.
So we've made sure seasonal firefighters can stay on the job, as long as they are needed this year, by allowing them to work beyond their term. And for next year, we're working to make more thanof those positions, permanent positions so that when fires aren't burning, we have a workforce of experienced hands enhancing our forest management, reducing the risk of future fire in the future fire season.
Second thing: We are harnessing new tools and technologies to better identify and respond before new fires grow into large, uncontrolled conflagrations. So, for example, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, has satellite technology that is able to see from space when new fires start, while they're still small, even as small as the size of your dining room table.
Similarly, the Department of Energy has a sensor array computer analysis capability that can detect in real time the lightning strikes that might set off a blaze. And we're going to use those tools to identify fires that start in remote places and share that information so the firefighters on the ground can respond immediately before a fire has spread out of control. I know that's not a full answer, but it's real. It will improve things.
And we're also going to make sure that the people have athe information to better protect themselves and their families from smoke and fire risks. This will include launching a new app onfrom EPA, so individuals can easily access the latest information on air quality, smoke plumes, and public health guidance.
Third, we also have to make investments in our future. That's why the bipartisan infrastructure framework investment of about $50 billion in themy so-calledanyway, I won't go into it. But a bill that's caused a little attentioninfrastructure billis going to build resilience to extreme weather events like wildfires$50 billion.
And today I'm announcing a $37 million Federal grant to Sonoma County, California, in support of fire mitigation efforts that are underway. This grant is part of FEMA's BRIC program, Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities. My administration doubled BRIC funding to support local efforts to strengthen resilience. And because Sonoma knows all too well the devastation wrought by fires, they were the first to apply for fire mitigation funding. I encourage more communities to do so next year.
And finally, I want to note that the extreme heat we're seeing in the West is not only a risk amplifier for wildfires, it's a threat in and of itself. People are hurting. It's more dangerous for kids to play outside. Roads are buckling under the heat. I need notagain, I need not tell all of you.
We need people to check on their neighbors, especially seniors who may need a helping hand; outdoor laborers, like our farm and construction workers, are going to need frequent water breaks and shade. I want to thank the Governors and local leaders for providing information to citizens and the resources like cooling centers where people can go to get relief from the heat.
And to our utility leaders: We are ready to work with you to make sure that people have the access to power, including air conditioning, under these extreme demand conditions while continuing to advance our climate goals.
Now, I'm eager to hear from each of youeach of the Governorsas to what the experience has been in your State and what we can do better to be helpful. Because this is an area where investing in prevention and preparation today is going to deliver invaluable returns tomorrow. And the Federal Government is going to have to dohave your backs. And that's going tothat's my intention.
I'll close by just saying thank you to everyone from the Forest Service, to the Department of Interior and Agriculture, to FEMA, to State and local and Tribal partners, and most importantly, our firefighters for all your incredible work. We've asked so much of the firefighters already, and I know you're going to continue to step up.
Now I'm going to ask Vice President Harris to say a few words, and then we'll move on. Madam Vice President, the floor is yours.
Vice President Kamala D. Harris. Thank you, Mr. President. First, I just want to thank the President for prioritizing this for his administration.
[At this point, the Vice President continued her remarks, concluding as follows.]
And the bottom line is that: As the President has said, his bipartisan framework for infrastructure is going to address a lot of these challenges. But there is other work to be done, and so I look forward to staying in touch with all of you. And again, thank you for your leadership.
The President. Well, thank you.
Governor Brown, if you'd be willing, you could give us an overview of what youthe challenges are you western Governors are facing and what you think we should be doing and can do to help. Ithe floor is yours.
Governor Kate Brown of Oregon. Thank you so much, Mr. President and Madam Vice President, for having us here for this incredibly important conversation.
[Gov. Brown continued her remarks, concluding as follows.]
And then, finallyand I just have to say, gratefullyour Good Neighbor Authoritywe have partnered with the Federal Government over the years to reduce wildfire risk on Federal lands through collaborative processes, including prescribed burns, removing dead trees and underbrush. With the recent passage of our State legislation, we have an opportunity to fund even more of these Good Neighbor Authority projects together. It's a win, win, win. It creates jobs, creates healthy landscapes, and reduces wildfire risk. And we have the dollars to invest now.
So we look forward to partnering for youwith you, and we are incredibly grateful, Mr. President, for your leadership.
Back over to you.
The President. Well, Madam Governor, I'm not being solicitous when I say we're grateful for your leadership. I really mean it.
And one of the things that I'd like to ask before we move on is: What would you be looking for us to do at the Federal level to strengthen this agreement to build off the lessons thatyou know, the Good Neighbor agreement? And is there anything in particular that isyou've learned from last season that would beadd to the needs of this season?
Gov. Brown. Well, you mentioned it in your remarks, Mr. President: Making sure we have resources to train our National Guards men and women prior to fire season has been extremely helpful the last two fire seasons. This should be universal practice nationwide. It's incredibly helpful. We have relied on our National Guard every step of the way throughout the pandemic, and we certainly rely on them in support activities and firefighting.
The other pieceand I see Chief Christiansen therein terms of the Good Neighbor Authority, this has been extraordinary in our ability to put people back to work in our timber-dependent rural communities, in our ability to create healthy landscapes, in our ability to provide timber for the mills, and frankly, our ability to reduce wildfire risk.
And so more resources to collaborate and provide what you describe as ""comprehensive, collective efforts"" to reduce wildfire risk would be extremely helpful.
The President. Well, we ought to getnot in this momentbut we're ought to get, no pun intended, deeply in the weeds as to specifically what can be done.
And I'd ask my appropriate Cabinet members to be working with your people as to what we can do along those lines because it seems to be self-evident that that makes a lot of sense.
Andbut we have a lot of other things to cover here, but I look to Dr. Sherwood: Are we moving to
Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall. We're going to move shortly. If you want to ask any further questions of Governors, and we can move, with the press departing, and we'll continue our discussion.
The President. Let me ask the Vice President if she has any questions and/or any Cabinet member if they have any questions for the Governor.
Vice President Harris. What I'm interestedit's really a follow-up to what the President asked: Whatwith each consecutive wildfire seasonand they are growing in terms of the enormitywhat are we learning? And how can the Federal Government address the challenges and the gaps that you have seen with each fire season, in terms of the resources, but also the approach?
Andfor example, including the public education piece; including the piece that is about encouraging the private sector, where appropriate, to be engaged around resilience and adaptation. On the issue of water policy, what kind of resources do you need that are also preventative as well as reactive to the wildfires themselves?
Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Adviser Sherwood-Randall. Governor Newsom, do you want to pick that one up?
Governor Gavin C. Newsom of California. Yes. Well, first, if I could just make a little indulgenceand thank you, Madam Governor and Madam Vice PresidentMr. President, I've been waiting almost, well, 4 years to hear a President say what you just said.
[Gov. Newsom continued his remarks, concluding as follows.]
And I just want to say we respect and appreciate your leadership, and we're just grateful and humbled that you took the time today to be with all of us.
The President. Well, look, Gov, this is aI'm not doing anybody any favor. I just think ifif I were sitting in your seat or Governor Brown's seat, what I'd beI mean, this is urgent.
And one of the things that I have found since becoming President is how often I'm required to call in the National Guard.
Vice President Harris. Yes.
The President. The National Guard. I spent yesterdaywell, that's not true2 days agomeeting with our military. What they've done is just astounding. I just met with the general who had coordinated probably the largest effort tothe largest logistical effort in American history getting all these COVID vaccines out.
I mean, think about whathow we're relying on the military in ways we never, ever, ever anticipated. And now I got my briefing at NOAA on what was going on in hurricane season. And it's, you knowand we're looking for the National Guard there too.
And so we just have to think differently, like you all have been talking about. And I promise you, when we get down to the nitty grittyand a lot of this we're already getting down thereyou got to tell us what you need. And we can debate it. We can discuss it.
And I think this is ayou know, that old overused expressiona ""wake-up call"" to the rest of the public, who all of a sudden is sayingI've had people say to me, when I've been on the road the last monthless than that; probably the last 3 weeks""Oh, my God. I didn't think things were really changing that much. I saw thosethose photographs of the reservoirs in California, andoh, my Godthey're reallythere's no water?"" Or people saying, ""A hundred and seventeen degrees andyou know, in Portland?""
So I think this is bothyou know, the old expressionwe've got to make lemonade out of lemons here. We have a chance to do something that not only deals with the problem today, but allows us to be in a position to move forward to make and create real good jobs, by the way, generate economic growth in all the process.
So thank you.

2021-06-29 00:00:00,"Remarks on Jobs and Infrastructure Legislation in La Crosse, Wisconsin","
Good afternoon. Thank you, Laurie. Please, please, please sit down. I once said that to a big crowd; it was in the evening. I said, ""Please, sit down."" And there were no seats. They were out in a football field. [Laughter] And the press pointed out, ""Biden is losing it."" [Laughter] But I can see you all have seats. [Laughter]
Laurie, thank you very much. I told Laurie, when she was showing me the bus she's driving now: Back when I was in law school, I drove a school bus during the summers to pick up spending money. And from one bus driver to another, Laurie[laughter]I want to thank you for all you do to make this city run, to help folks get where they need to go. And you do it in a way that sometimes is not always easy.
I'm glad to be here with great Wisconsin leaders. Gov, I guess I landed at the airport just a few minutes before you did. Thank you for making the effort to be here. And my good friend, Tammy BaldwinSenator Baldwin is here. And Congressman Ron Kind isand, Mom, thank you for raising a good kid.
And Mayor Reynolds. I was telling the mayorhe just won reelectionhe won election. And I said, ""You know, I always wonder why everybody runs for mayor,"" because theyit's the hardest job in American politics. They know where you live. [Laughter] You can't go to the grocery store. ""Why is that pothole still there?"" I get it. You don't even control that. But anyway, Mr. Mayor, thank you for your service. Thank you for willing to serve.
I'm here in Wisconsin to celebrate a step forward for my countryour countryto talk a little bit about what it's going to mean for working families here in Wisconsin and across the Nation. When I was sworn in 5 months ago, I pledged to put my whole soul into bringing America together. I said I was running for three reasons, the last one of which I said is to unite America.
I admit it's difficult, and I think some of my friends in the press thought it was impossible. I still don't think it is, butbecause I believe that there's nothing we cannot do if we bringcome together as a nation, Democrats and Republicans. And we're really divided on a whole range of things.
But if you look back across our history, from the transcontinental railroad to the creation of the internet, you can see the truth in that idea, about coming together. Because AmericaAmericahas always been propelled into the future by landmark national investmentsinvestments that only the Government has the capacity to make; only the Government, working together, could make.
Today happens to markcoincidentalbut today is the 60th [65th]* anniversary of one of those significant investments to change the Nation. Sixty-five years ago today, President Dwight Eisenhower signed the bill that created the Interstate Highway System. Sixty-five years ago today. That was the last infrastructure investment of the size and scope of whatthe agreement I'm about to talk about today.
It's time for us to write a new chapter in that story. After months of careful negotiation, of listening, of compromising together in a good faith, moving together, with ups and downs and some blips, a bipartisan group of Senators got together and they forged an agreement to move forward on the key priorities of my American Jobs Plan, and one of them is sitting in front of me.
As a result, this is a generational investmenta generational investmentto modernize our infrastructure, creating millions of good-paying jobsand that's not coming from me, that's coming from Wall Streetmillions of good-paying jobs that position America to compete with the rest of the world in the 21st century, because China is way out-working us, in terms of infrastructure.
And it's going to make the world of difference for families here in Wisconsin. Here's what it's going to do: This deal will put American workers to work in good-paying jobs, not minimum wage jobs, not 15-dollar-an-hour jobs. Prevailing wage jobs, good-paying jobs, repairing our roads and our bridges.
You all know why that matters. One in 5 miles of highway and roads in America are in poor condition1 in 5 miles. Some States it's worse where the weather is tougher. Five percent50 years50 [40]* percent of our bridges are over 50 years old. More than 1,000 bridges here in Wisconsin are rated as structurally deficient by engineers1,000 just in Wisconsin.
And I'm notthat doesn't make Wisconsin better or worse; it'sall across the Nation, it's this way. The bridgesthe 10 most traveled bridges in America need repair, and some need to be completely rebuilt. More than 600more than 600 here in the State of Wisconsinbridges have weight limits to prevent trucks from crossing. That means long detours for farmers heading to market.
It's more than just an inconvenience; it's about safety as well. In November 2019, a school bus in Arcadia, Wisconsin, tipped over going around a curve and went into a ditch with 20 students on board. It wasn't because of snow or ice; it was just an old country road. It was rough conditions. Thank God nobody was seriously injured at the time.
But this is a drain on our economy as well. Typical Americantypical Americanand it varies slightly from State to Statebut the typical American pays a hidden tax of more than $1,000 a year in wasted timewasted timeand fuel due to traffic congestion. Now, in the more the rural the areas, the less the congestion. But that creates other difficulties. You all know that feeling: losing time, sitting in traffic, or being rerouted because the bridge isn't wide enough or the road is poorly maintained.
This deal is going to put Americans back to fixing all of that and good-paying jobs. This deal will also put Americans to work replacing 100 percent of our Nation's lead water pipes. You know, there's 400,000well, I won't get into the numbers; I get a little carried awaybut it's really dangerous. Every single American child, at home or in school, will soon be able to turn on that faucet, and their moms and dads know that the water they're drinking is clean and safe.
I'll give you an example of why that matters. Just look at the city of Milwaukee. Milwaukee has more than 160,000 water service lines. More than 70,000 of them, nearly half, have lead service lines. And by the way, I'm notit's not picking on Wisconsin, Gov. Every State is like this. But just to know what you're going to be doing for the State of Wisconsin here.
You know, we know that exposure to lead in drinking water can trigger a number of serious problems. Even low levels of lead can cause behavioral and learning problems in children, impairing their growth. There are up to 10 million homes with lead pipe service lines and pipes. Children in up to 400,000 schools400,000 schoolsand childcare facilities are at risk of exposure to lead. This deal contains the largest investment in clean drinking water and waste water infrastructure in American history.
This deal also provides something you're very familiar with in the Island. It provides funding to get dangerous chemicals out of our water systems, known as PFAs, or ""forever chemicals."" This is a problem all across the country, and I know that you're feeling it right hereright here.
Here in La Crosse County, just this spring, the State had to provide free bottled water to thousands of people on French Island because they were worried about those chemicals in the groundwater, which were linked to cancer and other illnesses. We'll pay for that. We'll get that done. We're also going to surge Federal resources to help address the forever chemicals not just here, but all across America. Unfortunately, Wisconsin is not unique in this problem.
This deal will also put Americans to work building transmission lines, the largest investment in clean energy transmission in American history. Power outages cost the U.S. economy up tonow, this isnow, we know this, but until you add it up, it doesn't seem to be that big a deal. It costs the economy, Congressman, $70 billion annually. You hear me? Nationally, $70 billion annually.
And as climate change induces extreme weather events more and more frequently, we need to make investments to build a more resilient grid to carry this electricity.
The majority of the Nation's grid is aging. Some components are over a century old. And 70 percent of transmission and distribution lines are well into the second half of their lifespans. You saw what happened in Texas this winter: The entire system in the State collapsed. The entire system.
That's why we have to act. This deal will modernize the power grid to be more energy efficient and resilient toand resistant to extreme weather; resilient against bad actors who try to hack and attack the grid. Because I just spent a lot of time in Europe trying to work on that.
And it's going to strengthen and revitalize our natural infrastructure, like our coastlines and levees, while preparing our physical infrastructure for wildfires, floods, and other extreme weather.
Anybody ever believe you'dyou hearturn on the news, and it will say it was 116 degrees in Portland, Oregon. A hundred and sixteen degrees. ""But don't worry, there is no global warming. It doesn't exist. It's a figment of our imagination."" Seriously.
When a severe storm rolls in, like you had in some parts of the State just recently, the power is going to be less likely to go out, the town water systems will be able to withstand what happens if weonce we make these investments.
And allas all of you know, America has one of the highest road fatality rates of anywhere in the industrial world. Let me say that again: the highest road fatality rates of any industrial nation in the world. I lost a wife and daughter and almost lost two sons.
Look, our fatality rate is double the rate in Canada on a per capita basis. I bet every one of you here can tell me what the most dangerous intersections in your town are. I'll lay eight to five, no matter what the town is. Maybe you don't have many, but everybody knows what intersections are the most dangerous.
When you're teaching your kid to drive, what do you do? You tell them, ""No, don't go down that road when you come home."" I'm being deadly earnest. ""When you come home, come home the other way."" Well, guess what? We've got an agreement to invest $11 billion to help cities and localities reduce crashes and fatalities in the community, especially for cyclists and pedestrians, which are increasing significantly.
This deal is going to more than double the funding directed to State and local programs that improve the safety of people in vehicles, including highway safety, truck safety, pipeline and hazardous materials safety.
I won't even get into this now, but you know, we have thousands of miles of pipeline. The vast majority of those pipes are 60 years or older, some of them more than 80 years old. A lot of them are leaking.
This is the United States of America, for God's sake. What are we not doing?
This deal will also help high-speed internet and make sure it's available to every American home, including 35 percent of rural families who currently go without it.
As of last spring, more than 82,000 children here in Wisconsin, which prides itself on its education, didn't have reliable internet access at home. Think about that yearin a year of remote schooling. When so many of our needs and our connections were forced to move online, tens of thousands of Wisconsin kids got left behind.
Did you ever think, here in America, that kids would have to sit in a fast-food parking lot just to do their schoolwork and homework because they could connect online? Not a joke. Ask any mom who has kids in school or a dad who is taking care of them. No child should have to do that. And no farmer here in Wisconsin should lose business because they don't have a reliable connection to the internet: know when to buy, know when to sell, and know what's going on.
You know, back in 1936, the Federal Government brought electricity to nearly every home and farm in America, and it spread the opportunity out for cities in every part of the country. It changed the lives and fortunes of thousands and thousands of homeowners, thousands of hometowns, and millions of American families. And it set the stage for a massive, sustained economic boom that would follow World War II.
High-speed internet is the equivalent of that today. It's a similarit's an equivalent of that. It isn't a luxury; it's now a necessity, like water and electricity. And this deal would provide for it for everyone, while bringing down the cost of internet service across the board.
This deal has also put Americans to work through a first-ever national effort to install electric vehicle charging stations, 500,000 charging stations nationwide along our highways and in rural and disadvantaged communities as well.
Think about what that can mean to the American autoworker and the future of electric vehicles. China is going full bore. They're providing more electric vehicles than any nation in the world. You know, it used to be, when I first got to the United States Senate, actually a couple ofactually, in the sixties, when I was getting outthe late sixties, when I was getting out of law school, what happened? We invested more in R&D and investment and manufacturing than any nation in the world. Now we're number eight in the world. China used to be number nine; now they're number two in the world.
And when you build a charging station, it spurs even more investment and more infrastructure around it: the local convenience store, the local hamburgers place. You know, think aboutnobody is old enough, but my dad used to tell mebecause he worked, back in the days, for the American Oil Companythey came along with automobilethe combustion engine. You needed to be able to put gas in the engine, I mean, in the car, the tank. Well, guess what? You had to build gas stations.
One of my dad's jobs and my Grandpop Biden's jobs was to go from city to city convincing them it was okay to bury these great big tanks with gasoline in them. And entire communities grew up around it.
Well, this is exactly what we have to do with regard to electric vehicles. This deal is also going to help our cities, our towns, our school districts deploy electric buses. Thirty-five thousand electric school buses that are accounted for. And there are about 475,000 school buses in this country, 95 percent of them like the ones you had here
[At this point, a child fell off a chair.]
is he okay, honey? You sure? He took a little bit of a tumble.
Ninety-five percent of them run on diesel. So, every day, more than 25 million kids and thousands of bus drivers breathe polluted air on the way to and from school. Diesel air pollution is linked to asthma and other health problems. It hurts communities. It causes students to get sick and miss time in school. We owe it to our kids to clean up the school buses, and this deal will help do just that.
I know that the city of La Crosse is getting two electric transit buses this fall; I think I saw them both. I was down in the Carolinas, looking at the bus company where you're going to buy themcharging stations to power them.
This bipartisan dealby the way, you had half Republicans and half Democrats come along and present this deal and negotiate this deal. It's going to help advance that effort.
This deal also modernizes our outdated airports, ports, and waterways. That means fewer delays that drain away so much money from families and from businesses. There's no good reason why that zerozeroof the top 25 airports in the world are in American. Zero. Not one in the United States of America.
This deal will put Americans to work through long-overdue national environmental cleanups. That means good-paying jobs, capping hundreds of thousands of abandoned oil and gas wells that need to be cleaned up and cappedmethane leaksprotecting the health of our communities. Making the same money it took to dig that well. And there's thousands of them.
Not to mention, this deal represents the largest investment in American passenger rail and in freight rail since the creation of Amtrak.
Now, I know I'm ""Mr. Amtrak."" I've traveled over 2 million miles on Amtrak. I commuted every day. I get it. I know you think I'm nuts. But, after my wife and daughter were killed, I decided to commute back and forth to Delaware. It was a 257-mile roundtrip.
I'll tell you a real quick story. I shouldn't bore you with it. But you know, the Secret Servicethey're the best in the worlddoesn't like you taking Amtrak because it stops too many timesthe train. They want me flying home in the small jets that were available as Vice President. Andbut that cost a lot of money, so I would go home on Fridays, you know, because my mom was passing away. I'd go home on Amtrak. And they publishedthey keep fastidious record of the miles you travel in an Air Force aircraft as President and Vice President.
And toward the end of my term, a headline came out in all of the papers: ""Biden travels""I think it was 1.3 or 1.7 million miles on Air Force planes. And so I'm getting on the train on that Friday, and these guys who all became my familyallthe conductors. And a guy named Angelo Negri came up, and he goes, ""Joey, baby!"" Grabs my cheek like that. [Laughter] And I thought they were going to shoot him. I really did. [Laughter]
I said, ""No, no, no, no, no, no, no. He's a friend."" He was like, ""What the hell."" And he said, ""Big deal, Joey. A million""whatever it was""three-hundred thousand miles. You know how many miles you've traveled on Amtrak, Joey?"" And I said, ""No, Ange. I don't."" And he said: ""At that retirement dinner, we calculated it. We estimated 127 days a year, 250 miles back and forth, three36 years, then as Vice President. Joey, you traveled more on Amtrak."" [Laughter]
Well, Iand when they named a station after me in my city, someone complained that Biden is using his influence. I said, ""Hell, they should name the whole Northeast Corridor after me."" I've[laughter]more than anybody else.
But all kidding aside, studies show that if you can get to your destination in the same amount of time or less on rail than you can by car, people will take rail. And, Gov, you know this better than anybody. Imagine if you could get from Chicagofrom La Crosse to Chicago in 2 hours, instead of 4. That's what this will allow us to build the capacity to do.
And besides, it will not only make your travel easier, notI don't know why you'd go to Chicago, butyou know, all kidding asideit would reduce the largest source of pollution in America: vehicle travel.
We're not just tinkering around the edges here. We're going to invest $66 billion in rail to eliminate backlogs, bring world-class rail service to areas outside the Northeast. Here in Wisconsin, we'll add new stops in Green Bay, Madison, and Eau Claire.
This deal also makes the largest investment in public transit in American history. A whole lot of people here in Wisconsin depend on public transportations, like the bus system here in La Crosse, to get to work, to school, and get around. Because of this deal, it will be safer, quicker, cleaner, more frequent, and more availablemore reliable. More transit options mean more people can access good jobs as well. One study found that it leads to higher wages for workers because businesses can attract more customers with the rail.
This bipartisan breakthrough is a great deal for the American peoplenot just for folks in the cities, not just for red States or blue States, but for everybody. And this jobthis jobsthe jobs that are going to be created here, largely, it's going to be those for blue-collar workers, the majority of whom will not have to have a college degree to have those jobs.
A lot of those folks are being left behind now. The guys I grew up with in Scranton and Claymont are being left behind. This is the answer for good-paying jobs. Jobs isjobs not just in our biggest cities, along our coasts, but in small towns across the country so families can build wealth and opportunity in rural hometowns and don't have to leave when they're grown up.
I've said it all along: This is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America, and long before, families in Wisconsin are going to see the benefits firsthand. Look, I'm always quoting my dad because he was smart and I loved him. My dad used to say: ""Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about your place in the community."" I mean he really would say this. When he lost everything in Scranton and we had to move down to Claymont, Delaware, a little steel town.
And he saidand the deal is going to deliver breathing room. All he said was, ""All you want, as a middle-class person, is just to have a little bit of breathing room. Notjust a little bit of breathing room."" That's why we've got to build this economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not trickle down, creating good-paying jobs with dignity and jobs that cannot be outsourced.
And critically, we're going to get it all done without raising taxes on a single American earning less than $400,000. Now, all of you making over $400,000, I love you, but I don't mind a little bit if your taxes go up a little bit.
But all kidding aside, I made a commitment: NobodyI would not support anything that raised a penny in tax on someone making under 400 grand. And that means, in this bill, there is no gas tax. Working families have already paid enough.
Instead, we're going to pay for these investments, in part, by giving the Internal Revenue Service the resources it needs to collect taxes on the wealthiest Americans who owe, but are currently not paying under the existing tax rules. And by the way, it's not done by thisit will be done by conservative economists and liberal economists. It cracks down on tax cheats, not just hard-working, middle class Americans.
And there's a lot of important investments in this deal that are long overdue. Economists of all stripes agree that it's going to create good jobs and dramatically strengthen our economy in the long run. It makes it easier for businesses to seamlessly transport their goods, makes it easier for workers to more easily access job opportunities.
But the reason this agreement matters so much: It's about what it represents. This deal isn't just the sum of its parts; it's a signal to ourselves and to the world that American democracy can come through and deliver for all our people. We can be united.
I just met with the G-7. I just met with all of NATO. And I just met with Putin. The autocrats think that democracy can't keep up with autocrats. Not a joke. But it's living proof that we can still come together in this country and accomplish something big and transformational.
I know that neither Democrats nor Republicans get everything they want in this agreement. It's not all that I proposed. But that's what our economy is all about. That's what it means to compromise and reach consensus. And that's what everyin the heart of every democracy.
And we can't give up on what wekeep finding ways to come together. Because every time we negotiate in good faith and come together to get something big done, we break a little more of the ice that too often keeps us frozen in place and prevents us from solving the real problems people are facing.
Let me be clear: There's much more to do. And I'm going to continue to fight for more. I'm going to keep working with Congress to pass even more of my economic agenda so we can keep building an economy from the bottom up and the middle out.
As we bring home key parts of my American Jobs Plan, I'm going to make the caseand I've told this to the negotiatorsI'm going to continue to make the case there are critical investments are still needed, including those in my Family PlanAmerican Family Plan.
Maybe the most important among them is extending the child tax credit, which will significantly benefit middle class and working folks. Let me explain what that is. Pretty soon, taxpayers in America are going to get a significant check back from the IRS. For example, if you areif you have to pay taxes and you have a good income, you get to deduct $2,000 per dependentper child. And that comes off the bottom line of your taxes, and you probably still owe more after that's cut off.
But for families who, in fact, don't have that big a tax bill, they don't get anything from this. So we changed the law this year, and it's cutting child poverty by 40 percent. And here in Wisconsin, by July 15, we're going to startthey're going to be picking up the phone and calling you to say, ""Thanks, Gov."" And they're going to get checks from the IRS.
Here's what they did: For every child you have under the age of 6, you're going to get $3,600. And for every child under the age ofbetweenover the age of 12, you're going to get $3,000. So you'll actually get a cash payment instead of just a credit against your taxes, because you don't pay that many taxes if you'reif you're makingif you're making the minimum wage or you're making $20-, $30-, $40,000 a year. And people say, ""Well, that's a giveaway."" Hey, guys, I think it's time to give ordinary people a tax break. [Laughter] The wealthy are doing fine. No, I mean it. I mean it.
Why is this not a tax break for working folks, when the stuff we give to the superwealthy are called ""tax breaks""? Look, major action on clean energy, housing, caregiving, on child and paid leave, universal pre-K, free community college. The human infrastructure is intertwined with our physical infrastructure. It's going to help us create more good jobs, ease the burden on working families, and strengthen our economy in the long run.
And I'm going outI'm going to be out there making the case for the American people until this job is done; until we bring this bipartisan deal home; until our human infrastructure, also, needs are met; until we have a fair tax system to pay for all of this.
And by the way, what I'm talking about in the Family Plan, let me tell you how I'm going to pay for it. And the American people, in the polling data, overwhelmingly support it. If we just raise the corporate tax to 28 percentit used to be 35 percent. It was supposed to come down to 28; it's now 21. If you raise it to 28 percent, you know how much money that raises? One-point-four trillion dollars. If you have a minimum global tax, which we agreed to in Europethat means so corporations can't avoid paying the taxes at homethat would generate, in America, $385 billion. If you end deductions for foreign corporations who ship their profits out of the United States, that raises $260 billion in these tax havens.
You know, there are 30 corporations in America of Fortune 500 making billionI'mI come from the corporate capital of the world, Delaware. Not a joke. More corporations are incorporated in Delaware than all the rest in America combined. Okay? Well, guess what? Fifteen of the Fortune 500 companies last year paidI mean, 30excuse mepaid zero taxes, and they made billions of dollars. Paid not a penny in tax, not a single cent.
I'm not trying to punish anybody. I'm just saying, ""Let's be fair."" If you just set up a minimum taxyou had to pay at least 15 percent of your earnings as a corporationthat alone would raise $230 billion.
The point is, I have never had a reputation of being someone who's out there trying to just out-tax people. But here's the deal, folks: I think it's about time there be fairness in the tax code. I don't want you paying more than your share.
But the tax cut that was passed under Trumpthe $2 trillion, not a penny of which was paid forwhere did it go? Over 80 percent of it went to the top one-quarter of 1 percent. I think you should be able to be a billionaire. I think you should be able to be a millionaire. But, for God's sake, at least pay. Pay your fair share. Pay your fair share.
Folks, there's a lot of work ahead to finish the job I've just outlined. There'll be more disagreements to resolve, more compromises to forge along the way.
But today, the American people can be proud of Democrats and Republicans; families here in Wisconsin can be proud; Congress can be proud, because this country came together, forged a bipartisan dealwhich a lot of has to do with your Stateyour Senatorthat delivers for everybody. We've shown the world, and just as importantly, we've shown ourselves that American democracy can come through. There's nothingnothing, nothingbeyond our capacity when we come together as one Nation.
So thank you, Wisconsin. Thank you all for who you are and what you do. May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, Wisconsin.

2021-06-28 00:00:00,Remarks at a Democratic National Committee Virtual Fundraiser,"
Reed, thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you for hosting this event and for your generous support. I might note thatI was saying to you when I got to speak to you a few minutes earlier that, you know, you haven't evenwe haven't even sat down with each other. You know, anybody who contributed and raised as much funds as you did, everybody expects to be knocking on my door foryou never asked me for a single thing. You've raised an enormous amount of money, and you said: ""The reason why we haven't gotten together, Mr. President, is because we didn't want to distract you. We want you to keep going."" And I'm likeI really mean it. I hope everybody understands that about almost all of you on this call. And I want to thank you for your incredible support.
And, Jaime, I think that Leader Clyburn was correct: You're the right choice for this job. You've been doing outstanding leadership. And let me just say that you're part of something special. We're bound together in one of the most consequential campaigns in the history of this country. It really was a battle for the soul of America.
And I just got back, by the way, from Europe after being there for, I guess, 13 days. I don'tI forget how many days. And I met for 5 days with the G-7 nations. I alsoand then there were four others that were thereIndia, Australia. And I won't go through all the detail; it'd be too boring for you. And then, I went to a NATO meeting with all the NATO representatives there and the heads of state. And then, I went to meet with Putin. Actually, in between, I did the EU.
And here's the bottom line: I thinkI know you all understood it: the incredible damage done to us, internationally, by the last outfit that sat in this seat. And I have to say, sitting here tonight, I've lived through what we've lived through. We know just how important it was. It turns out it was even more important than I thought it was.
Think about the last 150 days: The American Rescue Plan delivered shots in the arms. And by the way, we are in a position where we're getting close to making sure that 70 percent of all the people in America will have been fully vaccinated or at least get one shot by theby Independence Day. We're way ahead. No one thought we could ever do that.
And I'm in the process of being able to announce very shortly that we're going to generatehalf a billion doses we're going to give away betweenafter taking care of every single American. Half a billion doses give away to the poorest countries in the world. And that's what you do when you want to really help and influence people around the world.
And we putandbut beyond that, theyyou know, the act put shots in arms and checks in pockets for hundreds of millions of Americans who are on the edge. It's keeping food on the table, a roof over their heads. And maybe the thing I'm proudest of is, it's putting us back on track to cut child poverty in half.
A hundred and fifty million Americans are fully vaccinated now. The fastest job growth in the first 4 months, I'm toldnot because of me, but because of all of youof any previous Presidency. Projected economic growth at nearly 7 percent, the highest in four decades.
And just last week, I announced a bipartisan agreement in the Senate asking to make one of the biggest investments ever in infrastructureeverrebuilding our roads and bridges; delivering high-speed internet to every American family, rural and as well as in urban areas; delivering every clean water, getting rid of those lead pipes to every American; building a more resilient power grid; installing electric vehicle charging stations, over half a million of them. This is the largest investment in public transit ever and the largest investment in rail since the creation of Amtrak 50 years ago. It's about creating millions of good-paying jobs, and it's about our economic competitiveness.
You all know better than I, because you're all successful people, that we're in a race in the 21st century towho's going to have a strongest economy in the 21st century. And the rest of the world is not waiting around. We have more to do, and we have to move fast and move quickly.
This is aand this agreement, this infrastructure bill thatyou know, it signals in the world that we can function, we can deliver. We can do significant things and show that America is back. That's the message I delivered and received during the trip in Europe. I announced that America is going to help vaccinate the world, because that's who we are. That's what we can do.
I also rallied our European allies to holding China to the same rules of the road in a global economy in the 21st century.
I made clear to President Putin and Russia that the relationship between America and Russia should be stable and predictable. We should be able to cooperate where we have our interests, on nuclear nonproliferation and climate change. And where we have differences, I made it clear to President Putin that I understand whywe have to understand what exists, and whether it's on cyber attacks or interference in our economy, I will respond. I will respond. And I know we'll respond to specific kinds of actions that harm U.S. interests.
The bottom line of all this at home and abroad: We're proving that our democracy can deliver for the people when autocrats are betting we can't.
But we've got a lot more to do. As we invest in our physical infrastructure, we also have to invest in our human infrastructure, the so-called Biden Family Plan bill. We're going to move on the American Family Plan that will deliver childcare, paid leave, universal pre-K, 2 years of community college, and so much more.
And I will take the case to the American people on the need to protect the sacred right to vote. It's under assault in ways that I haven't seen in my entire career, and that's what got me involved in the first place. It's about who gets to vote and whether the vote counts. And we have a system that does both with integrity and independence. But the Republicans want to do what no political party has ever tried to do: get to decide if your vote counts. It's outrageous. We're going to fight like hell to make sure that doesn't happen.
There's so much to say on all of these subjects. I'm sorry[inaudible]such shorthand.
But to workthe work has not been easy, and I'm going to need all of you to help do that work. The DNC is going to need you, because here's the deal: We won in 2020 as a unified party, and we need to stay unified and keep doing the big consequential things.
If we make the right decisions in the next 4[inaudible]years, in 50 years, people will look back and say this was the moment that America won the future. But we can't do it without you. And it's not hyperbole to suggest what I saidthat America won the future.
So look, there's so much more to say, but the bottom line is that there's so much at stake. But I promise youI promise youI've heard from almost every major world leaderI've heard from every major world leader: We can do this. So we can, in the process, be helping the rest of the world by doing well for ourselves.
May God bless America, and may God protect our troops. And I look forward to meeting you all in a virtual photo line, which I guess is going to begin very shortly.

President Biden. And as the American press here can tell you, my commitment to Israel iswell, they can't tell you anything actually; they're not supposed tobut it's ironclad. It's real. It's something thatI often say, if there weren't an Israel, we'd have to invent one.
And so this includes, we'reyou know, we're committed tounwavering commitment to your self-defense. And today we're going to be discussing a broad range of challenges, including Iran. What I can say to you: Iran will never get a nuclear weapon on my watch, as they say.
President Rivlin. God bless you.
President Biden. And you know, theI directed last night's airstrikes targeting sites used by the Iranian-backed militia groups responsible for recent attacks on the U.S. personnel in Iraq. And I have that authority under Article II. And even those up in the Hill who are reluctant to acknowledge that have acknowledged that's the case.
I also want to be clear that, as I said, my team and I are already working closely with the Israeli Government tothat took office earlier this month. I'm looking forward to hosting Prime Minister Bennett at the White House very soon. And the U.S. fully supports normalization of the relationship between Israel and Middle Eastern countriesthat you're making some headway onand Africa as well.
And beyond, the important progress we are really looking forward to building back a wider block of peace and stability. And, going forward, Mr. President, the United States and Israel are going to continue to work together to advance peace in the region and stability.
And I've only one regret: You're leaving as President. But not immediately, and not soon.
President Rivlin. Seven years, for Israel, is enough. For the Americans, 8 years could be
President Biden. Eh[laughter].
President Rivlin. a little bit longer. But for the Israelis, 7 years, it's enough.
President Biden. Well, welcome.
President Rivlin. It's good to be President, I must say to you. Yes.
President Biden. [Laughter] Well, you've done incredibly well. You've been a great friend.
President Rivlin. I did. Absolutely.
President Biden. You've been a great friend.
President Rivlin. I did my best, of course.
President Biden. Well, you did your best, and it was as good as it could be.
President Rivlin. Thank you. There was
President Biden. All right, everybody. You have anything else you'd like to say?
President Rivlin. Of course, I would like to say and to mention that I'm delightedreally delightedto be here once again in the White House meeting you, the President of the United States.
Of course, I have to repeat what we know very well: Israel have no greater friend, ally than the United States of America. You are our best friends, and we are sharingwe are best friends, and the bonds between the people of Israel and the people of America is based on the understanding that we are sharing values: values of democracy and values of liberalism.
And because of that, of course, we, according to a real friendship, can from time to time discuss matters. And even theagree not to agree about everything. But we count on you. And your, really, declaration just now really brought the Israelis to understand that we have a great friend at the White House.
President Biden. You do.
President Rivlin. Mr. President, God bless you, God bless the people of America, and God bless the relationship between our two nations and to our two states.
President Biden. Well, I agree with you. And I thank you very much for being here.
President Rivlin. Thank you.
President Biden. Thank you all very much.

2021-06-25 00:00:00,Remarks Prior to a Meeting With President Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai and Chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation Abdullah Abdullah of Afghanistan and an Exchange With Reporters,"
President Biden. Well, it's good to see two old friends. We met many, many times in Afghanistan for long hours. And they're welcome here. They've had a chance to meet with theall the major players of the administrationfrom the Secretary of Defense, to the CIAacross the board. And it's good to have them here in the White House.
The partnership between Afghanistan and the United States is not ending. It's going to be sustained. And you know, our troops may be leaving, but support for Afghanistan is not ending, in terms of support and maintenance of theirhelping maintain their military, as well as economic and political support.
And they've both got very difficult jobs. Every time I think I've got a lottough job, I think, Mr. President
President Ghani. [Laughter]
President Biden. but seriously, Ithey're doing important work of trying to bring about unity among Afghan leaders upacross the board.
And they have toAfghans are going to have to decide their future of what they wantwhat they want. But it won't be for lack of us being a help. There's going to be aand the senseless violence that has to stop, but it's going to be very difficult.
But we're going to stick with you. And we're going to do our best to see to it you have the tools you need.
President Ghani. Well, thank you, Mr. President. First of all, let me pay tribute to the 2,448 Americans who paid the ultimate sacrifice, over a million American veterans who have served with honor and dignity for your security and our freedom.
The United States has not spared any effort in blood or treasure during these years. And as a grateful nation, I want to acknowledge that and ask you
President Biden. Thank you.
President Ghani. to thank the Gold Star families.
Second, President Biden's decision has been historic. It has made everybody recalculate and reconsider. We are here to respect it and support it.
Third, we are entering into a new chapter of our relationship where the partnership with the United States would not be military, but comprehensive, regarding our mutual interest. And we're very encouraged and satisfied that this partnership is taking place. Thank you for ordering the priorities.
The Afghan nation is in an 1861 moment, like President Lincoln, rallying to the defense of the republic, determined that the republic is defended. It's a choice of values: the values of an exclusionary system or an inclusionary system. We're determined to have unity, coherence, national sense of sacrifice and will not spare anything.
Just for your information: Today, the Afghan Defense and Security Forces have retaken six districts, both in the south and the north. It's showing our determination. So I hope that nobody does the Bernard Shaw on us, exaggerating our death before something has happened.
Let us understand that in moments of great transition, things happen. But you will see that with determination, with unity, and with the partnership, we will overcome all odds. Thank you, Mr. President.
President Biden. Thank you. Thank you all. Appreciate it. Thank you.

President Biden. I've not been able to hear anything about what's happened. How long has he been sentenced?
Q. Twenty-two and a half years.

2021-05-06 00:00:00,"Remarks on Infrastructure and Jobs Legislation in Lake Charles, Louisiana","
Well, Mr. Mayor, Governor, thank you. It's good to be back in Lake Charles. I've been here a number of times over the years as Senator and then as Vice President.
The first time I came down herewith a guy named Russell Long, who I served withI was 29please, sit down, everybody. I was 29 years old when I got elected, and I went to see Russell Long. And he said, ""Son""I'd made my stops to all the senior Senators, which was what you do in those daysand Ihe said: ""Son, sit down. Sit down."" And he pounded on his desk.
And I sat down, and he saidhe said, ""How much money did you spend on your campaign?"" And I said, ""Well, sir""and this is going to shock you. I said, ""About""I said: ""A little over $285,000, but then I had to borrow some money andto get through it. And I just won, barely, by less than a half a percentage point.""
And he said, ""Well""he said, ""It's a good thing you won."" [Laughter] And I said, ""How is that?"" He said, ""Well""he said, ""You've got yourself a $38,000 deficit."" [Laughter] And I said, ""Yes, sir."" And he said: ""Well, if you hadn't won, you'd just have a plain old deficit. Now you can have a deficit party."" [Laughter] God, I misshe was amazing. An amazing guy.
And both of you are amazing. Mr. Mayor, you've got a great city. And as I said, I've been hereI've been here more than once, and it's good to be back. And Iit's hard to believe thatthat you got hit as badly as you have within the timeframe you have. And I used to spend some time with Randy; he got hit a little bit, but not like you didnot like you have. And, Gov, you know, we have to build back. We have to build back better.
One of the things thatthat I'm proud of is, in the first 100 days that I became President, we have created more jobs in that period of time than any administration in history. But the way I look at that, that's just the down payment getting us back with the American Recovery Act [Rescue Plan].* Just getting us back and getting peoplea lot of that had to do with getting people vaccinated, getting 600 million doses of the vaccine, and getting people in a position where it was available.
But now it's about rebuilding America, rebuilding in a way that it has resilience. And the folks who are going to rebuild it are those folks right over there: unions. They're going to rebuild it in a way that we're going to provide good jobs.
Well, look, it'sas I said, it's good to be back, Governor Edwards and Mayor Hunter. And I also want to thank President Reinethe union president of AFL-CIOhead of thethere you are. I couldn't find you.
And, folks, there's awhen it comes to bridges and roads and the like, I've never seen a Republican or a Democrat road. I just see roads.
And, MayorI mean, you're a Republican. You wrote a newspaper article suggesting that wealong with the Governorthe Democratic mayor of Shreveport, Mayor Perkinsas to why we need the American Jobs Plan andwhich is what I'm here to talk about today: a once-in-a-generation investment in AmericanAmerica itselfto create jobs, to modernize our bridges, our roads, our highways, our ports, our airports, our water pipes, our water projects, high-speed internet, transmission lines, and sustainable housingsustainable housingjobs rebuilding the foundations of a strong, fair, and resilientresilientcompetitive economy.
You know, I know the times have been tough here. And the damage of the hurricanes has been devastating. The Governor has already spoken to me; we're talking with OMB and with our folks inRepublican and Democrats in the Congress, because I believe you need the help. I believe you need the help. We're going to try to make sure you get it.
But the people of Louisiana always have picked themselves up, just like America always picks itself up. There's no quit in America. There's no quit in Louisiana, as I've observed.
But that doesn't mean the Federal Governmentbecause it was local, doesn't mean it shouldn't help. I promise you, we're going to help you build back better than ever and more resilient. And build back in a way that all we build is better able to withstand storms andthat are becoming more severe and more frequent than ever.
I think we have toyou might have noticed I promised I would have aI would have a climate forum for the world in Washington within 100 days. Well, 40 Heads of State showed up, from the largest countries in the world to some of the smallest. We can't deny it: There is a real change in the weather. And if we go 1.5 degrees warmer, we're going to be in real trouble, at the point of no return.
Matter of fact, a lot of what we're going to have to build back now, in terms of infrastructure, we've got to build back to a different standard, not to what it was. It's got to be better because the climate has changed enough now that it's still going to rise 2 feet when thewhen it rains. It's still going towe've got to build for what is needed now. And I promise you, we're going to do that. And we're better preparedso we're better prepared to withstand storms andbecoming more severe and more frequent.
We're standing here in the shadow of the I-10 bridge, which I've gone over several times myself in the past. And it's a perfect example of how we've neglected, as a nation, to invest in the future of our economy and the future of our people.
You know, when the bridge was built in 1952, it was built tothere was nothing thereit was built to make sure that we, in fact, are able toit was going to last for 50 years; that was 20 years ago. It was built for 50 years.
The I-10 bridge was built to handle a daily traffic load of 37,000 crossings. Wellbut, today, every day, more than 80,000more than 80,000 cars and trucks cross over that bridge. And it doesn't have the modern safety features that bridges need to have now.
You know, six lanes of the interstate narrow into four lanes of a bridge. That's a recipe for disaster. And that's whatI'm sure you don't need to tell the drivers around Lake Charles that it means traffic bottlenecks and delays, and that they'llat the last inspection, this bridge was characterized as in ""poor"" condition. And after decades of politicians studying it and talking about it, Governor Edwards is the one finally moving forward with a project to actually replace the bridge: one with six lanes, new interchanges, that's safer and reduces congestion.
And it shouldn't be as hardit shouldn't be this hard to take soor take so long to fix a bridge that's this important. It makes no sense. But the truth is, across the country, we have failedwe have failedto properly invest in infrastructure for a half a century. The last 4 years, how many times did you say, ""This is going to be Infrastructure Week""? Well, I got so tired of hearing ""Infrastructure Week"" and nothingnothing happened. Nothing has happened.
And across America, there are more than 45hear me now45,000 bridges that are structurally deficient. Structurally deficient. Every day, Americans cross these bridges 178 million times. And they are structurally deficient.
We've seen what happens when they deteriorate. Remember a few years ago? Two counties over thein Mississippi had to shut down more than 60 bridges that were in poor condition. Sixty bridges. People in those communities were rerouted from 40 to 50 mile of detours with half-hour to hour delays.
One of the areas, when I was doing this with our last major plan thatwhen Barack was Presidentwas in Pennsylvania. There was a large shopping center, a school, and the rest, and it was just across a creek, as we say up in thatthat way.
And the bridge across it was deficient. But there was a fire station just within eyesightfrom here to the other sidethe parking lot. But guess what? When there was a burn, when there was a fire, it took themthey had to go up 9 miles to find a bridge, come back, and by that time, a hell of a lot of damage was done. Well, there are bridges all over Americabig and smalllike that.
A few years ago, as I said, we found ourselves in a position where it's not just more inconvenient, like in the situation in Mississippi, it is also a matter of life and death: keeping firefighters, paramedics from getting people help they need; cutting off hurricane evacuation routes.
In addition, more than 1 in 5 miles of our highways in the United States of Americamajor roads in Americaare in poor condition1 in 5 miles. That's more than a safety hazard. That is a drain on our economy.
The typical American paysI know this is going to sound wonky, but it's real, and it affects ordinary Americans' lives, like the neighborhoods I come fromthe typical American pays a hidden tax of more than $1,000 a year in the time it wastes and the fuel wasted due to traffic congestion because of the nature of our infrastructure.
We rank eighth in the world in terms of our infrastructure. We used to be the leader in the world. All told, these delays cost our countryaccording to economistsan estimated $160 billion a year in waste: extra fuel, extra time, and the like.
And that's due to the congestion. And folks in Louisiana know, there are much greater threats than just congestion. When the road or the bridge is washed out, or when it can't stand up to a hurricane, people can't get to their jobs, can't get to their schools. Families can't get to hospitals safely.
This is about creating jobs and also saving lives. You know, my mother used to have an expression, Gov, she'd say, ""Out of everything bad, Joey, something good will come if you look hard enough for it."" Well, one of the things that this crisis, in terms of the health crisis of COVID, has shown us is that we have to build back better in a whole series of ways.
It's about building a strong foundation for the American people. So when I think about the threats of hurricanes and global warming andthen the poor condition of our economy as it relates particularly to infrastructure, I think of one thing: I think of jobs. Jobs. Jobs.
Everything we'regone through is now the, sort ofthe blinders have been taken off the American people. They know how bad of shape things are in. But it createsif we moveall the economists, including the liberal as well as conservative think tanks, point out what we'll create when we pass this Jobs Planwe'll create up to 16 million good-paying jobs. Not $8 an hour or $12 an hour, not $15 an hourprevailing wage jobs. Wages you can raise a family on. You have amy dad would say just a little bit of ""breathing room"" after everything is paid.
And so, you know, yourthis State is working to rebuild the I-10 bridge. But we can put America to work in every State, fixing roads and bridges that are in desperate need of repair.
My plan is a one-time, $115 billion investment above and beyond business as usualwhat we usually do, everything in the Highway Trust Fundthis is above what we have spent in the past, so we can modernize bridges and roads and highways that need it most, putting people to work in good-paying jobs.
Now, I know a lot of you watching at home are thinking thatwell, you know, if these jobs are for you. Well, you know, all you folks who feel left out as the economy is moving so rapidly, everything is changing, and you're wondering whether thewhat you did beforeis it going to be available to be done in the future? Well, let me tell you something: If you feel left out and forgotten in a rapidly changing economy, let me speak directly to you.
Nearly 90 percent of all the infrastructure jobs that this is going to create won't require a college degree. Seventy-five percent of them won't even require an associate's degree. These are jobs that can't be outsourced. Can't be outsourced. They just require something we've got in good supply here in Louisiana: hard work, grit, and sweat. Like the workers that are here today, and like all of the people you know and grew up with.
The American Jobs Plan is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America. A blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America, to supercharge our economy so we can move goods, get to work, become more competitive around the world. You know, it will shorten our commutes to give us back the lost time with our families, to make our commutes safer, save lives. All told, the American Jobs Plan is going to modernize 20,000 miles of highways and roads.
It will fix the Nation's 10 most economically significant bridges that require replacementthey're just not safe anymore, which this bridge could be one of themand repairs 10,000 bridges that desperately need to be upgraded. Bridges that get kids to school, people to market.
And you know, when you build better roads or extend the train line over to the next town or install reliable, high-speed internet, it sparks new life and investment in communities. It gives people hope. Business picks up at the local convenience store, at the seafood market, at the hardware store where centercenters of people, locus inand their jobs and their economies.
Better jobs start coming to town. We haven't seen that in a long time. Suddenly, young people don't have to make the decision whether they have to leave to have a better opportunity. They stay where they are.
That's what infrastructure does. It has a rippling effect. And when it makes allwhen we make all these investments, we are going to make sure of one thing: that we buy American. Now, I know I'm being accused, when I say I'm only going to buy American as President, that somehow I'm going to violate trade agreements. No.
Since the 1930s, you're allowed toa President could just decide to buy only American. It's notit's justI'm going to get to spend somewhere in the order of $600 billion this yeareverything from building an aircraft carrier, new decks, and all. And I guarantee you one thing, and I've said it in place: Every single thingfrom the deck of an aircraft carrier, to a railing in a new buildingis going to be built by an American company, American workers, American supply chain so that we invest American tax dollars in American workers. And that's what we're going to do. I promise you.
Because right now that law has existed, but you're allowed to have exceptions. So what do you do? The last Presidents have come along and said, ""Well, we have a little trouble making sure we can find somebody who is able to put the railings in this new building and the stairwells."" Well, guess what? There's a whole hell of a lot of Americans who make that. So we're going to have a spotyou just call the White House. We'll find you any company that makes those railings, for exampleas one concrete examplerather than going abroad to purchase those. It's going to create jobs and is going to generate economic growth.
And look, this is all about making a choice: a choice between giving tax breaks to the superwealthy and to corporations, and investing in working families, who are going to build the country. I look at this aswhat I'm talking aboutas giving, essentially, tax breaks to hard-working middle class and working people who built this country.
In my view, it's an easy choice: invest in workers wearing hard hats and doing the hard work of rebuilding the country and putting line workersfor example, to put line workers and electricians to work laying thousands of miles of transmission lines to build a modern energy grid; to put engineers and construction workers to work building modern roads and bridges, weatherizing homes and buildings, and setting new standards where they have to be built with better material and that have to be built to withstand heavy winds and hurricanes and the like and to withstand the impact of the changing weather; to put plumbers and pipefitters to work replacing a hundred percent of the Nation's lead pipes and service lines that are delivering poisoned water to our kids in thethere are over 400,000400,000 schools in America that have lead pipes leadingI mean, 400,000yes, that's right400,000 have lead pipes going to the schools right now. And you have over 10 million homes where their water source is fed by lead pipes that were laid years and years ago.
We're going to rip it all upall upand make it safe all across America. And it's going to provide millions of jobsthousands of jobs. And it's going to provide much more security. It's going to put plumbers and pipefitters to work replacing this so every child in America can turn on a faucet and not worry about drinking polluted water.
I'm going to be visiting a water plant in New Orleans today to get a closer look at what's needed to modernize the city's water system because it needs modernization, and they need it repaired.
Look, these are the highest value investments you can make as a nation, and they last the longest. Economistsleft, right, and centeragree that these are the investments we need to make to generate historic economic growth that's maintainedmaintainednot just bringing jobs back, but creating new jobs. And together, with the American Rescue Plan, the American Jobs Plan is going to help the economy create, as I said, estimated over 16 million good-paying jobs.
And, folks, we can't afford to not do it. We can't afford to not spend the time and effort and money.
Now, let me explain how we pay for this, because I'm not a deficit spender. Because, you know, we had a tax cut the other team put in back in nineteenin 2017, and it created a $2 trillion deficit, with the vast majority of that going to the top 1top one-tenth of 1 percent of the wage earners.
I don't want to punish anybody. You're entitled to be a millionaire or a billionaire, just pay your fair share. Just payfor example, if we just were to make sure that we had the tax rate for the top rate in America for income taxwhat it was in the Bush administrationit would go from 36 to 39.6 percent.
Well, guess what? That would raise a minimum of $10 billion a year. No one is hurt. Someone making that money is still going to have two homes or a jet planeor these are mostly millionaires; they're not going to be hurting a little bit. But we're going to be able to put tens of thousands of kids in preschool and in free community college.
What's going to help America more? Increase the educational standard of all Americans so they have 14 years of school, from 2 years of3- and 5-year-olds3, 4, and 5 years oldwe show that that happens if they getnot go to daycare, they go to school. No matter what the background or the home they come from, they catch up. Fifty-eight percent of them will go on to go to college; we know that now.
We also know that if you give 2 years2 yearsof free community collegeyou're in a situation whereyou're in a position that you're going to havein your State and every other State in America, you'll allow to go in the last 2 yearsall of those credits are available to your State universities, and you can get a 4-year degree for half the cost. And/or you get the 2-year degree, and you're able to do what you needed it to do. It's estimated it will increase the average income by over 20 percent for someone in America for the rest of their lives.
So, folks, you know, the fact is that I'mas I was saying, I'm not looking to punish anyone. You know, I come from the corporate State of the world, Delaware. More corporations are incorporated in the State of Delaware than every other State in the union combined.
But guess what? You know, I'm sick and tired of corporate America not paying their fair share. Their taxes used to be 38 percent36 percent. We all thought that was too high, even in our administration, and we wanted to reduce it to 28 percent, make it more competitive. Some thought 24 [percent].* But it got reduced to 21 percent. And do you know what the result is? Of the largest corporations in America, 50 don't pay a penny in tax. They made $40 billion and don't pay a penny in tax.
If you're a construction worker and your wife is a schoolteacher, you're paying at a higher tax rate than corporate America is paying. Not a joke. Not a joke. I don't want to punish them.
And by the way, they used to do a lot more research and development. Major corporations, now, because we've changed the lawin fact, it used to be that a corporate CEO got paid 36 times as much as the average employee in their corporation in the Fortune 500; now, it's 456 times. My mother would say, ""Who died and left them boss?""
Well, 56 percent of all53 percent of all of the money they madeexcuse meof a trillion dollars over 10 yearswhat did it do according to a major study? It went to buying back their stock. Now, why are you buying back the stock? Because CEOs now get paid in stock purchasesstock options. It used to be, they got paid in direct salary. And they get paid in stock options. So, if you have 10 shares of stock, you sell 5, the 5 left are worth more. You get paid in stock, you getit's better.
The remaining 37 percent goes to dividends, which makes sense. But it leaves 9 percent9 percent for everything, according to the study out of the University of Massachusettseverything from salaries, employment, research, and development9 percent.
So, folks, you know, we used to invest in research and development in this country in about 2.4 percent of all that we did, havemaking us the leading country in the world in change and research and development. Well, we now do 0.7. The Chinese are eating our lunch. They're eating our lunch, economically. They're investing hundreds of billions of dollars in research and development.
That's why, right now, if it keeps their way, they're going to own the electric car market in the world. They're going to own a whole rangewe've got to compete. We've got to compete. And it doesn't cost anybody anything and deprive anybody of anything they have earned or deserve.
As I said, we're now at a place where, when they used to pay 35 percent, it's now 21. The way I can pay for this is, the $40 billion, for example, just making sure the largest companies don't pay zero. And reducing the tax cut to between 25 and 28, it's a couple hundred billion dollars. We can pay for these things.
I'm not talking about deficit spending. I'm talking about paying for it. And I won't goand I'm realizing getting too wonky, sharing and giving you too much detail. But the point is, what I'm proposing is badly needed and able to be paid for and still growtrickle down ain't working very well, man. We've got to build from the bottom andup and the middle out. That's how we build America. That's how we built it so well back in the sixties.
And so, folks, look, a middle class family, as I said, and a construction worker with a kidwith two kids is paying more in Federal taxes than a multimillion-dollarbillion-dollar corporation that's making billions of dollars, in terms of the rate at which they pay.
And look, here we go. You know, it's stillthe fact is that the plans that I put forward meets the middle class and raises corporate rate. It also lowers it wherelower than any point that it was since World War II. And it's going to generate $90 billion each year, hundreds of thousands of jobs. We're going to put a lot of folks to work.
And by the way, how many of you are veterans or knowor have a brother, a sister, a mother, father who is a veteran? Well, here in Lake Charles, you've got a new veterans clinic. It was built a few years ago, beginning when Barack and I were in office. But most VA hospitals, for example, are 50 years old or older. Ask your buddies. Ask your buddies.
When theywe have more people, more veterans, and more active military committing suicide every week than are killed in all our wars. Why? Pick up a phone. We have more people coming back with posttraumatic stress than anything else.
I carry in my pocket my schedule. On the back of my schedule I have updatesU.S. troop updates: how many people have died in Iraq and Afghanistan. Not ""generally over 6,000""six thousand, as of this morning, nine hundred and twenty-seven, because every single, solitary one of those fallen angels left an entire community behind. Wounded: 53,196not ""roughly 53,000.""
Well, guess what? Ask your peopleask around in your State and any other State. You've got a husband, a wife calling, saying she's having posttraumatic stress, and she's stressed""I need to get therein there right away."" ""Well, we can't see you for 3 weeks. We don't have enough docs."" And the buildings are 15 years old50 years old. We have a sacred obligation to invest in that infrastructure. Better docsnot ""better docs,"" more docs; more psychiatric nurses in order to take care of these things.
Look, folks, the bottom line here isand I'm going on too longthe American Jobs Plan puts people to work upgrading VA hospitals and putfor our veterans and our servicemembers and military families.
And let me ask you: What's better for Americaa tax cut that makes corporations richer and CEOs richer, or investments that are going to make our country stronger, more competitive, and lift up the standard of living for everybody?
And by the way, this is not punishing anybody. All those folks are still going to have two homes and three homes and their jets, and it won't matter. Not going to change their standard of living one little bit.
Not surprisingly, critics say they're worried that I'm going to stunt economic growth by raising taxes on corporations and the wealthy. There's just one problem with their argument: the facts.
Experts have looked at it. The last time taxes were around the rates I'm proposing was in the nineties, and the economy boomed. America created 20 million new jobs in 8 years when these were the tax rates. And the facts are, the American economy has had a record job creation and growth under the same kind of plan I'm proposing. And here's why: Our economy has always done best when everyone pays their fair share.
Again, I'm not looking to punish anybody. I'm looking to rebuild America as a world leader. I'm going to look to make sure we have the best and most significant infrastructure in the world. It's time to grow this economy from the bottom up and the middle out.
Let me close with this: Infrastructure has historically been a bipartisan undertaking. There's no reason it shouldn't be that way again, as the mayor is evidence of, and others are. It's about coming together to create jobs to make a more competitive world.
What's the first thing that anybody asks you when they want to put a new facility here in your city? ""How close is the interstate? And whathowyou know, what's the access to the lake? What's goingI mean, what's the water supply?"" They want to know you have the best infrastructure. Companies and corporations go where they can get their product made the quickest and get it to market the fastest.
And we're doing everything we can to win the competition for the 21st century. I'm willing to hear ideas from both sides. I'm meeting with my Republican friends up in the Congress to see, number one, how much they're willing to go for, what they think are the priorities, and what compromises weI'm ready to compromise.
What I'm not ready to do: I'm not ready to do nothing. I'm not ready to have another period where America has another ""Infrastructure Month"" and doesn't change a damn thing.
America is more competitive, better, and more capable than any nation in the world. There's not a damn thing we cannot do when we do it together. It's about time we start working together, like mayors and local officials do, like Governors do.
I find more support from Republican Governors and mayors and Democratic Governors and mayors around the country, because they've got to answer the question, ""Is life better in this town, this city, this State than it was before I got elected?"" And we can make it better. We can make it better. It shouldn't be controversial.
So let me conclude by saying: God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you.

2021-05-05 00:00:00,Remarks on Implementation of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 and an Exchange With Reporters,"
The President. Good afternoon. Earlier today I visited a restaurant here in town, LasI'm going to mispronounce itLas Gelameas [Gemelas].* Andwhich is a pilot program for the Restaurant Revitalization Fund and an important piece of the American Rescue Plan.
One of my goals with the American Rescue Plan is to make sure that we get this law's benefits quickly and directly to the American people. So before I say a bit more about what we're doing to support our Nation's restaurants, let me provide an update on what is happening through the American Rescue Plan right now, as I speak.
First, it's providing checks in pockets and shots in arms. More than 163 million rescue payments have already gone out. These are checksdirect payments of up to $1,400that, for a typical family of four making about $110,000, means a $5,600 check you'll get. By the time all of the money is distributed, more than 85 percent of American households will have received a check.
The Rescue Plan is also funding vaccine administration and distribution. It's a big reason why we were able to administer over 220 million shots in my first 100 days, a pace unmatched by any other nation in the world or in prior mass vaccinations in all of American history.
You know, it's helped schools reopen safely. It's helping childcare centers stay in business. It's helping families pay for childcare. The Rescue Plan is delivering food and nutrition assistance to millions of Americans facing hunger. And hunger is already sharply down in the United States.
It's also providing rental assistance to keep people from being evicted from their homes, it's making health care more affordable, it's cutting child poverty in this country in half, and the list goes on. And the message is clear: Help is here.
And the bottom line is this: The American Rescue Plan is working. America is getting vaccinated. Job creation is soaring. The economy is growing. And our country is on the move again.
But some of the parts of theof our economy need special help. At the top of that list is our Nation's restaurants. When the COVID-19 pandemic struck, our Nation's restaurants were some of the first hit and the worst hit. In 2020, more than 2,300excuse me, 2 million2.3 million restaurant's jobs disappeared2.3 million restaurant jobs disappeared.
Restaurants are more than a major driver of our economy, they're woven into the fabric of our communities. And so, for many families, restaurants are the gateway to opportunity, a key part of the American story. There are families of all races, all ethnic backgrounds, all nationalities in this country who have built their American Dream around a family-owned restaurant. And for more workers, their own story of economic progress starts in a restaurant.
In the restaurant I just visited, Rogelio Martinez, who immigrated to this country 17 years ago, started working as a meatpacker. Now he's the restaurant's lead butcher and one of its owners.
For nearly one in three Americans, a restaurantthis is hard to believebut for one in three Americans, a restaurant provided their first job. More than half of all Americans have worked in a restaurant at some point in their lives.
Before the pandemic, restaurants and bars employed 12 percent12 percentof all the workers in our country. This is an industry that provided more opportunity for minority managers than any other industry in America. This is an industry where the staff feels like family and often is family.
When the pandemic hit, restaurant owners and operators were resilient, creative, and generous. Almost overnight, restaurants put in place safety measures to protect their employees and to protect us. They stepped up to feed our frontline workers. They changed their menus. They transitioned to takeout and delivery so they could be serving people who depended on them. But whenbut even with the changes, many had to furlough or lay off workers or close entirely.
The restaurant I visited today went from 55 employees to just 7 before it started to bounce back. Now, as we vaccinate Americans, customers are coming back. And the vaccinationour vaccination progress and our economic recovery is going hand in hand. As that happens, we want to make sure that our restaurants, bars, and other dining establishments can staff back up and they can come back as well.
Right now only about a quarter of the restaurant owners expect to return to normal operations in the next 6 months. We can do much better than that with the American Rescue Plan. The Restaurant Revitalization Fundthat's what it's called, ""Revitalization Fund""will provide direct relief to restaurants and to hard-hit food establishments: bars, bakeries, food stands, food trucks, and caterers.
Businesses that get grants can use it to cover payroll, rent, utilities, supplies, everything they need to startto stay open and to reopen. We arewe're opening the doors of this program forso that restaurants all over the country can open their doors again.
We start acceptingwe started accepting applications on Monday. Today is Wednesday. We made it quick and easy to apply. Within the first 2 days, there were 186,200 applications from all 50 States for help. That's a staggering number.
Ninety-seven thousand97,600 of those applications came from businesses owned by women, veterans, and socio-economically disadvantaged individuals. Now, the applicationsthey haven'tall haven't been processed yet. But right now it looks like we'll be able to provide help to about 100,000 restaurants and other eligible businesses. When we passed the American Rescue Planwe did thatsome people said it wasn't needed. This response proves them wrong; it's badly needed.
About a year ago, when the first round of the Paycheck Protection Program opened up, a lot of the smallest firms saw the doors shut in their face. The law was written so that as we process these applicationsthe new onethat we focus first on those who were left behind by the other relief programs.
And to make sure that relief is distributed fairly, we also set aside funds for the smallest restaurantsbars, food trucks, and many family-owned restaurantsthat haven't gotten any help to date, and they need it. That way, they don't have to compete above their ""weight class"" for these grants. Sixty-one thousandsorry for all the numbers, but they're important61,700 applications have come from the smaller bars and restaurants already. And I want to thank the Small Business Administrator, Isabel Guzman, for the work that she and her team are doing to make sure we get help quickly and fairly to the businesses that need it the most.
As I said, I've spoken to dozens of restaurants' owners about the challenges they face. But I've also received letters from people who want to tell me about the restaurant owners in their communities. I received one letter from a man who asked me to look out for a pair of local restaurant owners who he described as, quote, ""the hardest working people I've ever met,"" end of quote.
Another letter was from a woman who wanted to tell me about how important the couple that ran the restaurant in her town near her was. She said they are, quote, the ""strong, consistent foundation of our community,"" end of quote.
Whether it's our economy or our sense of community, we're relying on restaurants to play a big role in our recovery. If we want our economy to recover in a way that deals everyone in, then our restaurants need a seat at the tableno pun intended. That's what we're giving them. That's what this program is about: a seat at the table.
This is another example of how we're putting the American Rescue Plan to work quickly and effectively and showing the American people that their Government can delivercan deliver for them again and do it without waste; that we can vaccinate this Nation; that we can get our kids safely back in school; that we can get our economy back on track by helping hundreds of thousands of small businesses reopen and stay open; that we can give the people of this Nation a fighting chance again. That's what this is all about.
God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you.
Q. President Biden, you said earlier
World Trade Organization 
Q. President Biden, are you going to back the waiver of the Uat the WTO? Are you going to back that? Is the U.S. Government going to back that?
The President. Yes, I'm going to talk about that later today. Yes.
Republican Party Leadership 
Q. President Biden, you said earlier you ""don't understand Republicans."" [Laughter] What does it say about them if they oust Liz Cheney from leadership for telling the truth about the election?
The President. Look, it seems as though the Republican Party is trying to identify what it stands for. And they're in the midst of a significant, sort of, minirevolution going on in the Republican Party.
I've been a Democrat for a long time. We've gone through periods where we've had internal fights and disagreements. I don't ever remember any like this.
And so, as one of you saidand I'm not embarrassed by identifying themas one of you said on national television last night, we badly need a Republican Party. We need a two-party system. It's not healthy to have a one-party system.
And I think the Republicans are further away from trying to figure out who they are and what they stand for than I thought they would be at this point.
Senate Minority Leader A. Mitchell McConnell/Bipartisanship/Infrastructure and Jobs Legislation/Tax Code Reform 
Q. Mr. President, Mitch McConnell said that he is 100-percent focused on stopping this administration. You've spoken about your relationship with him in the past. Do you still think you can work with him when he says things like that?
The President. Look, he said that in our last administration with Barackhe was going to stop everythingand I was able to get a lot done with him.
Againlook, everything I'm proposing that be done to generate economic growth, employment, and put us in a position where we can outcompete any other country in the world with research and development and moving ahead, I pay for. We talk about, ""I'd love""we talk about how, ""This is going to cost so much money; I'm not paying for it.""
The bottom line is this: My Republican friends had no problem voting to pass a tax proposal that expires in 2025, that cost $2 trillionnone of it paid forincreased the deficit by $2 trillion; gave the overwhelming percentage of those tax breaks to people who didn't need it: the top one-tenth of 1 percent. They didn't need it.
And it was argued that what it would do is generate this great economic surge and growth. It would increase productivity. It would pay for itself. It would generate a sense of growth in America we hadn't seen ever before. Well, everyone from the Heritage Foundation on has pointed out it hasn't done thathasn't done that.
Now, I come along and the proposals that I'm suggesting are tried-and-true things, like when you rebuild bridges, things get better; when you rebuild highways when you don't have toyou know, youairports, portsit all matters. It increases productivity.
And the programs that relate to people are programs that are the things that also generate economic growth. And I view them as, for example, tax cuts for middle classupper-middle class, middle classand working class people. And so you eliminate a few of thejust have the super wealthy begin to pay their fair share. For example, you haveyou know, you haveI think it's 35 or 30 corporations didn't pay a single, solitary penny last year, and they're Fortune 500 companies. They made $400 billion. They paid no taxes.
How can that make any sense? Especially since these corporationsand I come from the corporate capital of the world; more corporations are incorporated in my State than all the rest of the country combined. If you notice, corporations aren't investing any money in research and development. Somewherewhat's most of it going to? Buying back their own stock; stock dividends, which makes senseleaving, by some studies, less than 10 percent for research, development, pay raises, et cetera.
Used to be that, not too long agofor example, during the Bush administration, the tax rate for the very wealthymaking well over millions of dollarswas 39.6 percent. It's now 37 percent. Just raise it back to what it was before.
It raises enough money from that savings to put every single person in community college who wants to go. Now, what's going to grow America more? What's going to help you and your security more: the superwealthy having to pay 3-pointalmost, yes, 3.9-percent less tax or have an entire generation of Americans having associate degrees? That's why all the economists, even on Wall Street, are pointing it out. Guess what? It grows the economy. Benefits everybody. Hurts nobody.
But now, it'stalk to thethe Wall Street Journal[inaudible]talk about it: a welfare program. It's about growth. And so, you know, the idea thatit's just amazing. I mean, corporate taxes, they were 36 percent. Our administrationthe last administration said, ""We should lower it."" We suggested it to be lowered to 28 percent. Well, it's got lowered to 20 percent or 21 percent.
Show me something that's benefited. What's happened? Show me where the growth is. What's it being invested in?
Yes.
Corporate Tax Rates/Education and Family Assistance Legislation/Tax Code Reform 
Q. Mr. President, on the corporate tax rate, have you talked to CEOs about that? I'mand have you
The President. Yes.
Q. have youare you open to, say, 25 percent?
The President. I'm open to compromising, yes. It doesn't have to be exactly what I say, but to suggest that, which some of the folks are suggestingand I'm going to meet with Republicans next week when they come back and seriously meet with them. I'm willing to compromise. But I'm not willing to not pay for what we're talking about. I'm not willing to deficit spend. They already have us $2 trillion in the hole.
Soand by the way, you sawyou know, the last five leaders of the Fed coming out and sayingwhat'd they say? They said, ""Biden's plan is going to grow the economy."" You have Moody's talking about increasing it up toI don't know what the most recent one is16 million new jobs. It's about growth, not stunting growth.
I think I said, not too long agoI guess it was back in the 2000 range, there aboutdon't hold me to the exact year; I'll getI'll have my staff come back with the exact datethe average CEO of the Fortune 500 companies makes like 36 times what the average employee of that corporation made. It's over 450 times as much now.
And, as my mother would say, ""Who died and left them boss?"" No, seriously. What rationale? Tell me what benefit flows from that. We're not going to deprive any of these executives theirthat second or third home; travel privately by jet. It's not going to affect their standard of living at all, not a little tiny bit.
But I can affect the standard of living of the people I grew up withif they have a job, I can expect to make[inaudible]standard of living of people I grew up withif they have childcare and can afford it so 20 million women can be back in the workforce. This is just notmakes no sense to me.
But it's going toI'm going to have to be able to explain this, and I'm going to keep banging at it. I thinkI'm not being solicitous and I'm not trying to ruin your reputation. I think most of you understand what I'm sayingwhether you agree with me or not, I think you understand what I'm saying. It's fair to say this is about making the average multimillionaire pay just a fair share. It's not going to affect their standard of living a little bit.
Thank you all very much.
Q. Sir, you said the interest rates

"
2021-05-04 00:00:00,Remarks on the COVID-19 Response and National Vaccination Efforts and an Exchange With Reporters,"
The President. Good afternoon. Today, 2 months until July 4, I'm here to report that we're in our vaccination programwhere we are and what comes nextin an effort to get this country back closer to normal.
And first: Where are we? Well, as everyone knows, I promised that we'd administer 100 million shots in my first 100 days. After we met that goal, we doubled it to a historic 200 million shots. By the time we reached 100 days last week, we had shattered that mark with over 220 million shots in arms.
And, as we stand here today, almost 150 million Americans have gotten at least one shot. Over 105 million Americans are fully vaccinated. And among our most vulnerable populationseniorswe are nearing 85 percent of those who have gotten their first shot. Seventy percent of the seniors are now fully vaccinated. It's a dramatic turnaround from where we were in January, when less than 2 percent of adults and less than 1 percent of seniors were fully vaccinated.
Not only that, cases are down in 40 States these past 2 weeks. Deaths are down dramatically since January, down over 80 percent among seniors, which includes a drop among Hispanics of 80 percent and among African Americans of 70 percent of seniors.
There are tens of thousands of Americans alive today becausewho would not be alive otherwise were they nothad access to rapid vaccination program. Moms and dads, sisters and brothers, grandparents, neighbors, old friendsthey're around now, and Godthank God for that.
Now, where do we go from here? Well, as we anticipated, the pace of vaccinations is slowing now that the majority of American adults have already gotten their first shot. But we are still vaccinating millions of Americans every day.
In fact, in the last 10 days, 1 out of every 10 adult Americans got a shot. But, soon, we'll have reached the adults who are most eager to get vaccinated, and, at that point, this effort will shift to a new phase, which is what I want to talk about today.
Our new phase will focus on three areas. First, kids, children between the ages of 12 and 15 years of age. They are not yet eligible for a vaccine. The FDA's scientists are currently reviewing the data to decide ifif and whento authorize that age range for vaccinations. The FDAand the FDA alonewill make that decision.
But today I want American parents to know that if that announcement comes, we are ready to move immediatelyimmediately move to make about 20,000 pharmacy sites across the country ready to vaccinate those adolescents as soon as the FDA grants its okay.
Now, most Americans have a vaccination site about as close as their house is near to a neighborhood school. We're also going to slip vaccines directly to pediatriciansship them to pediatricians during the following weeks. So parents and their children can talk to their family doctor about it and get the shot from a provider they trust the most: easy, fast, and free.
And if teens are on the move this summer, they can get their first shot in one place and the second shot elsewhere. We know that adolescents are at risk from COVID-19. Though serious illness at that age range is rare, they can still get sick and spread the virus to others. So my hope is that if the vaccine is authorized, parents will take advantage of it and get their kids vaccinated.
The second area of focus is making it more convenient for everyone to get a vaccine. We know that many adults have not been vaccinated because they have found it too confusing or too difficult or too inconvenient to get a shot.
So for those having trouble finding a location or making an appointment, we're going to make it easier than ever. We have formally launched a simple website where you can find a vaccination location closest to you. That site is vaccines.gov. Let me say it again, vaccines.gov. Go there now, find a location to get the shot, and make an appointment.
Also today, if you prefer texting, we have another easy way to get the shot. Text your ZIP Code to the following number: 438829. Your ZIP Code to that number: 438829. And you will get a text back with the location that is nearest to you with vaccines in stock right then and there. Yes, you can text your ZIP Code right now to 438829 and get texted back within minutes with the place that's nearest to you to get a vaccination that are available immediately.
So send this to your kids, your grandkids, your friends who have not been vaccinated yet.
Now, I know some people find making an appointment in advance inconvenient. So, starting this week, we are also going to direct all Federal pharmacy partners to begin to provide walk-in hours. You'll soon be able to get vaccinated without an appointment at the vast majority of our 40,000 pharmacy locations across the country.
We also are encouraging our State and local partners to have a walk-in ability as well to the sites that they run. And beginning next week, we'll be shipping new allocations of vaccine to rural health clinics, getting more vaccines to more rural clinics so Americans who don't live near one of those 75,000 vaccination sites will have new options that may be closer than anything they thought.
We know that vaccination rates are lower in rural areas, and that's why we're going to get vaccines closer than ever to rural residents. Also, as we wind down the large mass vaccination sites, we'll move towards smaller locations even more convenient to the unvaccinated. So, for those who don't want to drive the distance to a large vaccination site, we will have sitessmaller sitescloser to the unvaccinated.
And for the first 100 days, our goal will be to make it possible for people to come and get vaccinated, and we'll succeed beyond anyone's expectations, I believe. Now we are going to have to bring the vaccine to people who are less eager. So we also know that there are millions of Americans who just need a little bit of encouragement to get the shot.
I recently called on employers to do their part by offering paid time off for employees to get vaccinated and opening up a tax credit program that reimburses the businesses for the cost of giving the employee the time off to get vaccinated. And I want to thank the 1,000 businesses that have stepped up so far.
We're also going to roll out new partnerships with the business community. We're working with major businesses, like grocery stores, to provide special deals like discounts to shoppers who come to their stores to get vaccinated. Theand it works both ways. Bring them in to get vaccinated, but when they're in, they will get discounts to purchase goods in that store.
Further, we're working with major sports leagues to launch special promotions for their fans: things like ticket giveaways, in-stadium vaccination programs, discounts on merchandise, and other creative ways to make it easier and more fun to get vaccinated. Now, I'm making it sound more fun to get vaccinated, but it doesn't hurt to get vaccinated. I'm not saying it's fun, but they'll be able to have other things available to them besides being protected from the virus.
Let me repeat: We're going to make it easier than ever to get vaccinated. Visit vaccines.govvaccines.gov. Or text toyourtext your ZIP Code to: 438829438829. Walk into your local pharmacy without an appointment. Go to the doctor or a local health clinic. It's free. It's nearby. Every adult is eligible. You know, go get the shot as soon as you can.
The third area of our focus is Americans who still aren't sure they want to get vaccinated. We've seen the confidence in vaccines rise steadily these past few months among virtually every segment of the population.
And as more and more Americans see their friends and family get vaccinated, they're making the choice to get vaccinated themselves. Democrats and Republicans, progressives, conservatives, people of all persuasions are getting vaccinated. In factthe fact is that nearly 85 percent of seniors have had at least one vaccination shot, and the wide cross-section of the Nation trust the vaccine regardless of race or ideology.
Now we need to make that same progress for those under 65 years of age. There are a lot of younger people, especially those in their twenties and thirties, who believe they don't need it. Well, I want to be absolutely clear: You do need to get vaccinated. Getting vaccinated not only protects you, it also reduces the risk that you give the virus to somebody else. It could save your life or the lives of people you love.
We're still losing hundreds of Americans under 65 years of age every week, and many more are getting seriously ill from long stretches of the time. Look, even if your chanceeven if your chanceof getting seriously ill is low, why take the risk when you have a safe, free, and convenient way to prevent it?
Additionally, we know that some people may need more information to decide whether to get the vaccine. There is now plenty of information for people to do their homework within nearly 150 Americans livingin fact, with 150 million Americans that are living now have gotten the vaccine.
Talk to someone you trust like your physician or your pharmacist or people who have already been vaccinated. Talk to your faith leaders or others in your community that you trust. Look to those people to help answer your questions.
I want to be clear. I've been saying this a long time, but I really believe it: This is not a Democrat or a Republican issue. Science behind the vaccines has been under development for decades. Two of our vaccines were authorized under prior administrations, Republican administrations. My administrationa Democratic administrationis doing the work to get hundreds of millions of shots in arms. While we may not always agree on everything, this is one thing people across the political spectrum can agree on.
So, I want to thank the prominent conservatives, like Mitch McConnell, and a large group of Republican Members of Congress who have medical training, who have advanced getting vaccinated. I also want to thank the 105 million Americans of every background who are fully protected from one of the deadliest pandemics in our history.
You know, there's a lot of misinformation out there. But there's one fact I want every American to know: People who are not fully vaccinated can still die every day from COVID-19. Look at the folks in your community who have gotten vaccinated and are getting back to living their livestheir full lives. Look at the grandparents united with their grandchildren, the friends getting together again. This is your choice. It's life and death.
And I hope everyone knows within themselves, it makes the choice that willit's going to help them and their loved ones be safe, get our businesses open again, and get us back to normal.
Again, in the next 2 months, our focus is going to be on three groups: kids between 12 and 15 who are awaiting potential FDA authorization to get a shot; two, adults who have had trouble locating a place to get a shot or who just haven't gotten around to it; and three, those who need more convincingbeing convinced of the necessity of getting the vaccine.
As we turn to this new phase, we're also setting a new goal. Two months from today2 months from todayfamilies across the country are going to celebrate the Fourth of July. Our goal by July 4 is to have 70 percent of adult Americans with at least one shot and 160 million Americans fully vaccinated.
That means giving close to 100 million shotssome first shots, others second shotsover the next 60 days. Of course, Americans can still get shots after July 4, but no one should wait. And let's try to hit that 70-percent mark at least with one shot before that day. It's another huge goal.
And as you may remember, we were initially focused on getting enough vaccines for every adult. Well, we did that. We have enough vaccines. Now that we have the vaccine supply, we're focused on convincing even more Americans to show up and get the vaccine that is available to them.
If we succeed in this effort, as we did with the last, then Americans will have taken a serious step towards a return to normal: That's July 4. But we're not there yet. That's why I'm asking people to continue to follow the CCD guidelinesCDC guidelines as we work to get more people vaccinated. And to clear up any confusion, the good news is that, last week, the CDC said that vaccinated people do not need to wear their masks outside unless they're at very crowded settings like a sporting event.
And if we can continue to drive vaccinations up and caseloads down, we'll need our masks even less and less. I know it will take time to get everyone back toeverything back to normal. You know, we're all going to have to be patient with one another. Masks have needlessly divided this country. Masking as directed is a patriotic duty, but so too is treating each other with respect and patience.
One final point: As I said in my address to Congress last week, Congress [America]* is going to be ""the arsenal"" for fighting COVID-19, just like we were forthe arsenal for democracy in World War II, not only because it will have kept us safe, but because ofit's who we are.
Well, we'rewe've already committed to work to send 60 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine to other countries, starting this month and into June. That means, of all the vaccines we've produced for the United States at that time, we'll have given about 10 percent to the rest of the world. It's a significant humanitarian commitment, in addition to our funding of COVAX. And I'll have more to say about that soon.
I'll conclude with this: The light at the end of the tunnel is actually growing brighter and brighter. So Americans have sacrificed and served to make this progress possible, showing the best of who we are as a people. We need youwe need youto bring it home. Get vaccinated.
In 2 months, let's celebrate our independence as a nation and our independence from this virus. We can do this. We will do this.
Thank you all, may God bless you, and may God protect our troops. Thank you.
[At this point, several reporters asked questions at once.]
Q. Mr. President[inaudible]to help India? Mr. President
Q. Mr. President, how much harder will this next phase be for the vaccination campaign?
The President. I'm sorry. You were both speaking. One at a time.
U.S. Supply of COVID-19 Vaccine Overseas 
Q. Mr. President, where are you sending the AstraZeneca doses first? What will be the criteria? Countries like India or Brazil that needs the most, or would it be to
The President. We're helping Brazil; we're helping India significantly. I spoke to Prime Minister Modi. What he needs most is he needs the material and the parts to be able to have his machines that can make the vaccine work. We're sending them that. We're sending them oxygen. We're sending them a lot of the precursors. So we're doing a lot for India.
With regard
Q. How about Brazil?
The President. Let me finish. With regard to the AstraZeneca vaccine, which we had, we have sent that vaccine to Canada and to Mexico. And there are other countries that we're talking to now. As a matter of fact, I talked to a head of state today.
I'm not prepared to announce who else we'll bewe'll be giving the vaccine to. But we are going to, by the Fourth of July, have sent about 10 percent of what we have to other nations, including some of the ones you mentioned.
Q. Are you sending to Brazil? 
Q. If this phaseif this phase is not successful
Coronavirus Vaccination Efforts 
Q. How much harder will this next phase be for the administration? How much harder compared to the first 100 days?
The President. Well, I think, in one sense, it's easier in that it's up to convincing the American people rather than guaranteeing them we'd have the supply for them. So that was really hard. It was really hard to get from, you know, as that old expression, 0 to 60 miles an hour toit was getvery hard to get from a very low count to 600 million vaccines and then set up all of the logistics.
But I think what's going to happenthis is my prayerthat more and more people who get vaccinated are going to be listening to people who they love and are around, and they're going to say, ""Why don't you just go ahead and do it?"" And there's some evidence, we still had a good dose of vaccine being administered the last 2 weeks, and it's still moving.
But we know we're going to get to a place where the doubters exist or the people who just areI don't want to say ""lazy""just not sure how to get to where they want to go. It's going to be hard. So we're going to keep at it. We're going to keep at it.
And, I think, at the end of the day, most people will be convinced by the fact that their failure to get the vaccine may cause other people to get sick and maybe die. And
Q. Mr. President, if this phase
The President. Let me finish here. Okay? I promise I'll get to you.
Q. Okay.
The President. Okay?
And so it'sin one sense, it's harderI mean, it's easier because I don't have to put together this massive logistical effort. But in the other sense, it's harder; it's beyond my personal control. I couldnot ""control""but I could arrange and make sure those other things happened if we did it well, and I think we did. But it's going to be harder.
Yes, ma'am.
Coronavirus Vaccination Efforts 
Q. Thank you. If this phase is not successful, are there any circumstances under which you would require the vaccine for people to do certain things, like travel? And, if not, what more can you do beyond this?
The President. Well, I'm not going toyou know, I'm one of these guys who thinks positively and not negatively. [Laughter] So there's more that we can do. One of the things we can do is we can continue to produce more of the vaccine, work harder to get it available to more people, and export a lot of that to help.
Secondly, whether we're going toI think that we're going to continue toI don't thinkwe're going to continue to try to bring inan, effectively, spokespersons who represent communities that, in fact, people listen to. And it's going to get more granular, I think, rather than large. The likelihood of us being able to get, you know, 100,000 vaccinations in a week at a major site is getting harder and harder. There'sthose people desperately wanted to get the vaccine.
So we'llI think we're going to make some real progress here. We'll see. But we're going to keep at it.
Q. [Inaudible]Putin
Coronavirus Vaccine Supply 
Q. Can you say whether you've spokencan you say whether you've spoken to your Trade Representative?
The President. Say it again?
Q. Can you say whether you've spoken to your Trade Representative yet, Katherine Tai, about the issue of issuing waivers on vaccine patents? Is that something you would support?
The President. Well, we're going to decide that as we go along. I haven't made that decision yet.
Q. Okay. Would you consider ordering more doses from Pfizer and Moderna?
The President. We are.
Q. You've already ordered 100 million more from each. Would you order, additionally, on top of that?
The President. The answer is: We're going toas long as there is a problem anywhere in the world, even if we solve it herewe're going to move as quickly as we can to get as many doses of Moderna and Pfizer as possibly can be produced and export those around the world.
Yes, ma'am. This is the last question.
President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin of Russia 
Q. Mr. President, thank you. Are you planning to meet President Putin during your tripyour upcoming trip in Europe? Is there a meeting that you're planning to have with him?
The President. With who?
Q. With President Putin.
The President. That is my hope and expectation. We're working on it.
Q. Can I just follow up, Mr. President?
The President. Thank you.
Coronavirus Vaccination Efforts 
Q. Mr. President, why can't you go higher for vaccinations? The U.S. is currently administering about a million first doses per day. Thirty-five millionyou'd need about 35 million new people to hit 70 percent. Why not set that target for 75 percent or 80 percent of the public?
The President. Well, I'd like to get it at 100 percent. But I think, realistically, we can get to that place between now and July 4.
And by the way, it's not like July 4, the doors close. [Laughter] It's just, I picked July 4 to try to get to a place where we get back closer to normal. And so we're going to be vaccinating people into next fall. It's not going tothis is not going tosomething that, all of a sudden, July 4, we're going to just declare it's over.
Thank you so much.
Q. Mr. President, just on Brazil

2021-05-03 00:00:00,"Remarks on Education and Family Assistance Legislation at Tidewater Community College-Portsmouth Campus in Portsmouth, Virginia, and an Exchange With Reporters","
The President. My name is Joe Biden. I'm Jill's husband. [Laughter] And just like the lovely lady in blue over here is a professor at a community college, my wife also works for your husband. [Laughter] Iand thank you for the warm welcome today at the airport. Appreciate it very, very much.
And Tim Kaine, one of the great Senators and great, great friend. And a guy I've relied on most of my careerwhen I was in the Senate, we worked together; and as Vice President; and nowis Bobby Scott. Bobby, thank you for everything you do. And, Congresswoman Luria, we even got to meet when you were in uniform, I think, if I'm not mistaken. And you're doing a great job, and thank you for being here.
And to all the faculty and the management and the folks here at the community college.
You know, one of the things that I really found interesting, Jaiden, is thatthe major you tookcybersecurity. We spent a lot of time, as my colleagues in the Congress and the Senate can tell you, worrying and dealing onwith cybersecurity. And it's really important thatnow that we get this under control. And we have the best trained people in the world, and you're going to be among them.
And I'm here today at Tidewater Community College to talk about the America's Family Plan andthat I announced last weeka once-in-a-generation investment in our families, in our children that addresses what people care most about and most needthe investment we need to win the competitionthe competition with other nations in the future. Because we're in a race. We're in a race.
It all starts with access to a good education, as you all know. When America made 12 years of public education universal in America in the early 1900s, it made us the best educated nation in the world, and you saw the benefits that came from that. But the rest of the world has caught up to us. The rest of the world has caught up to us. They are not waiting. And 12 years is no longer enough to compete with the world in the 21st century and lead the 21st century.
That's why my American Families Plan guarantees 4 additional years of public education for every person in America, starting as early as we can.
We were at an elementary school earlier today. And what we're talking about here isit means universal, high-quality preschoolfor 3- and 4-year-oldsnot daycare, preschool. And the research has shown, here at the great universities in this State and others, that children of that age who go to school, they are far more likely to graduate from high school and continue their education beyond that, rather than start off behind the eight ball if they come from families that are notdon't have educationscollege educations.
You know, a lot of kids start kindergarten hearing a million fewer words having spoken than other families, and it's an unfair disadvantage. But every child is capable. Every child is capable of learning.
So we just visited, by the way, a fifth-grade classroom in Yorktown earlier today, where the students areback together with their classmates and teachers in school. And we saw what'swhat being in school means for those kids.
Safely reopening the majority of the K-through-8 schools was one of my top priorities in my first 100 days, because there's so much that happens when they don't have the certitude and the companionship and the familiarity of being with their friends. There's an awful lot of need in this pandemic for mental health facilities and counseling.
And we met that goal by working with the Governor here to get educators and school staff vaccinated and to get them the resources they needed to open up safely.
And I've often said that children are the kite strings that keep our national ambitions aloft. We say ""all those kids,"" but they're all our children. They're all our children. And they are the kite strings that literally lift our national ambitions aloft. So we've got to invest in theminvest in our childrento invest in the future.
And we can't stop there. We're going to add 2 years of community college on top of that. You just heard Jill talk about how community colleges and how it can change lives. Well, students here, at the community colleges across the country, know why.
For some, it's 2 years of community college to earn enough credits to transfer to a 4-year universitywhich is available almost in every single Stateto become a teacher, an entrepreneur, or anything else. For some, it's getting extra training through a certificate program to get a good-paying job and a business in town.
We just met with the students at the HVAC workshop, ambitious, talented students, who are up to taking the next step in their lives. And with the skills they're learning hereand some of the students will go on to be plumbers and members of the Pipefitters Local 110, electricianslook, it means higher union wages with guaranteed health care and pensions.
And you know, it's kind of amazingone of the thingsI don't know if you knowthe First Lady of this State understands; she does, I'm positivethat an awful lot of folks who even get an opportunity to go to community college still can't get there because of food, transportation, and those other costs. And so we're going to increase Pell Grants so they'll qualifyeveryno, it would make a gigantic difference. It will make a gigantic difference.
By the way, I have to admit: If I didn't have these positions, I'd be sleeping in the Lincoln bedroom[laughter]rather than the Vicethe President's bedroom. [Laughter] But it reallyyou know, it really is how to start to transform a life and family and community and our economy: by investinginvesting in the people.
Every child has a capacity to learn. And I'veif I've heard it once, I've heard from Jill a thousand times: ""Joe, any country that outeducates us will outcompete us."" And that's a fact. And she'll be deeply involved in leading this effort as well.
The second thing: The American Families Plan is going to provide access to quality, affordable childcare, keeping parentshelping parents go back to work, providing a lifeline and benefits for children as they do better in school throughout their lives.
You know, it guarantees low- and middle-income families pay no more than 7 percent of their income for high-quality care for children up to the age of 5. And that makes a gigantic difference. There's millions of women out of work today not, because they're not qualified for the jobs they have, but they can't take care of their children and do their job. And the cost of childcare is extraordinary.
I was a single father when I first got elected to the Senate. I had two young boys raised after their mom and sister were killed, and I'vehad I not had the family I had, I'd never been able to do it. And I'm not joking about that. And I was a Senator; I was making a decent salary.
The most hard-pressed working families won't have to spend a dime if in fact my plan works. If you're low-income folks, you'll be able to get childcare for free.
Third, the American Families Plan is going to finally provide up to 12 weeks of paid and medical leavepaid family and medical leave. We're one of the few industrialized countries in the entire world that doesn't have this feature. No one should have to choose between a job and a paycheck or taking care of themselves, their parent, their spouse, or a child that's ill. They should have that opportunity.
And the fourth piece of the plan: The American Families Plan puts money directly in the pockets of millions of Americans. In March, we extended the tax credit for low- and middle-income families with children.
Now, if I could hold a second here, whatyou know, if you havemake enough money and you're paying taxes, you end up in a situation where you get to deduct $2,000 per childas a tax benefit. You don't get it back, but you get to deduct it.
Well, if you're a minimum-wage worker, you're not paying much tax. And if you're making less than that, which many people are, you're not paying any Federal tax. So you get no benefit.
So we put in placeand a number of my Republican colleagues shared the view tooalthough none on the voting floorbut theybut I think they share it as welland that is: Up to $3,000 per child, 6 years and older; and $3,600 for a child that is over 6 yearsunder 6 years of age. That means two parents and two young kids withthey get a check back from the Government for $7,200 in their pockets, which they're doing now, which can help them take care of your family. And it will benefit more than 65 million children. And all the data shows it will cut child poverty in half this yearcut it in half.
My plan extends the tax credit at least through the year 2025. Because what's going to happen in 2025, as the press knows, is the tax cuts of the last President expire. And we're going go backthat put us $2 trillion in debt. And then, we're going to compete as to what tax credits there are. I think it's about time we start giving tax breaks and tax credits to working class families and middle class families instead of just the very wealthy.
And here's what the American Families Plan doesn't do: It doesn't add a single penny to our deficit. It's paid for by making sure corporate America and the wealthiest 1 percent just pay their fair share. I come from the corporate capital of the world. More corporations are incorporated in the State of Delaware than all the rest of the Nation combined. And I'm not anticorporate, but it's about time they start paying their fair share.
It's about making a choice. You know, we have out therethis year, you had 50 corporationsmake, you know, $40 billionthat didn't pay a single penny in taxes. Not a single penny. I don't want to punish anybody, but everybody should chip in. Everybody should pay something along the road here.
The choice is about who the economy serves. And so I plan on giving tax breaks to the working class folks and making everybody pay their fair share.
Here's an example of that choice: If you ask the top 1 percent to pay the same tax rate they paid in 2001, when George Bush was President, that would generate $13 billion a year. Now, that's enough for us to take around $11 [billion]* of that $13 billion and provide for 2 years of community college free for every student in America.
So what's fair? Go from 36 to 39.6 percent, like it used to be, and be able to take care of everwhat's better? Just think about it in terms of what's better for Americanot Democrat, Republican, Independentwhat's going to grow America more? What's going to grow America more? What's going to make us more competitive, stronger? What's going to make us better educated?
So, for folks at home, I'd like to ask a question: Do we want to give the wealthiest people in America another tax cut? Or do you want to give every high school graduate the ability to earn a community college degree on their way to good-paying jobs or on their way to 4 years of school in industries of the futurehealth care, IT, cybersecurity, you name it?
Look, another example: For too long, we've had a two-tiered tax system. Working families pay taxes they owe on the wages they earn, while some of the wealthiest Americans avoid paying anything close to that fair share.
My plan revitalizes andthe capacity of the IRS to crack down onthere's a number of studies, from the former Secretary of Treasury on, that millionaires and billionaires are able to avoid taxes and cheat in avoiding those taxes because we have so few agents in the IRS.
It'sthe consensus is, if you increase the disclosure requirements for banks and financial institutions on accounts for the wealthiest Americans to reduce tax cheating, you will have two stepstwo steps would recover $70 billion per year that currently goes unreported and unpaid.
Nowand we've been hearing about this for the last 10 years. Instead of cutting a number of agents, we should be increasing the number of agentsnot hounding anyone, just being able to get access to information. And shut down all the tax havens from the islands toanyway, I won't go into it. I can get a little carried away with this.
But lookand we can take this moneythis money and pay for universal pre-K for every 3- and 4-year-old in America. So what is better? Making people just pay their fair share. Paid family leave. Childcare costs of working families, maximum of 7 percent of their income.
Again, it's a choice. It's more important to shield millionaires from paying their fair share? Or is it more important that every child gets a real opportunity to succeed from an early age and ease the burden on working families?
Third, we have a loophole in our tax system called ""stepped-up basis."" It's also known as the trust fund loophole. For example, if I had a million dollars in stock that I bought, and it made a million dollars and I was going to cash it in, I'd have to pay capital gain on that million dollars.
But if, God forbid, on the waygo back to where I wason the way to where we're talking abouton the way to cash in my stock, I got hit by a car and got killed, I can leave it to my daughter, and she pays no tax, a tax that was owed 2 seconds earlier.
It's not an inheritance tax. It was a tax was owed 2 seconds earlier. But that's what ""stepped-up basis"" means. It's a person passes away and leaves the stock in theirto their son or daughter; son or daughter don't have to pay anything on that multimillion-dollar gain when they sell that stock. And that's worth a lot of money.
Look, they may be decent and honorable peopleand they arebut the last thing Americans with aroundwith the amount of wealthneeds is another tax break.
We need to make a choice to eliminate the loopholeonly the gains above for peopleonly the gains above people making $2 million a yearor, excuse me, a couplea rate of [raise of]* capital gains rate for people making more than a million dollars a year, which, by the way, would affect three-tenths of 1 percent of all taxpayersthree-tenths of 1 percent of the top 1 percent.
And close another loophole, like the real estate investor loophole, where the wealthy is simply paying the same rate on their wages and investment income. That raises $40 billion a year for the next 10 years.
The reason I'm bothering to do this is, I keep hearing out in the press, ""Biden is going to raise your taxes."" Anybody making less than $400,000 a year will not pay a single penny in taxes. And we will not increase the deficit either, unlike the last gigantic tax cut, which increased the deficit by $2 trillion.
It's about balancing the system and growing the economy. It means wealthy investors no longer pay lower marginal tax rates than their secretary paysthe secretary in their office.
Do you want to know what that would do? That would take that money and extend the lifechanging middle class tax cut and put it in place for American Rescue Plan and expand childcare tax creditI mentioned earlier, that's $1,700 [$7,200]* in the pockets of a family with two kids fornow throughthrough 2025. Look, just closing these loopholes by taxing investment income at the same rate weforas wages for the wealthiest Americans, we'd have enough to extend this again through 2025.
So I ask again: Is it more important to keep these tax loopholes for millionaireswho are good people; they're not bad folks, butor would we rather put $7,200 in the pockets of working moms and dads every year if they have two children?
Folks, trickle-down economieseconomics has never worked. For too long, we've had an economy that gives every break in the world to the folks who need it the least. It's time to grow the economy from the bottom up and the middle out.
We can choose to give hard-working families a breaka tax break, in effect. We can choose to invest in our students. We can choose an economy that rewards work, not just wealth, and that choosesthe choice I'm making and the vast majority of the American people support is: Let's give people a shot. Given even half a chance, the American people have never, ever, ever let their country down. Imagine if we give them a full chance. Imagine what it would mean for them and their families and for our country.
We're the United States of America. There's nothingnothingwe've been unable to do when we do it together. So let's get together. Let's get this done. Because the truth of the matter is that we can do this and grow the economy. I won't go into all the other statistics, but the plan is estimated to grow the economy another trillion dollars. This will grow the economy. Everybody would be better off.
So I want to thank you all for doing your part here to make sure that not only you're educating and giving people a real shota real shotat a real life, consistent with their talents and their capacities, not limit it because they don't have the money. And we're going to give it to a lot more people.
I promise youI promise youAmerica will be much stronger for it. Because, like I said, if we're setting out a universal education, it wouldn't just be 12 years anymore. It would beit would be those 14 years16 years I'm talking about: 2 to start, and 2 at the other end.
And as your State has done under your Governor and your Senator and your Congresspersons, your Stateif you gotif you get 4 years out of here2 years out here, that's 2 years towards a State university. You cut tuition in half for a 4-year degree as well.
So there's an awful lot of possibilities, an awful lot of hope. And the good news is, I think there's overwhelming, bipartisan support for this. You look at the polling data: Republican voters overwhelmingly support it. Now I just got to get some of my Republican colleagues to support it.
So thank you all, and God bless you. And thank you for the work you're doing. And may God protect our troops. Thank you so much.
Coronavirus Vaccination Efforts 
Q. Mr. President, when do you think the U.S. will reach herd immunity? When do you believe the U.S. will reach herd immunity?
The President. I think, by the end of the summer, we'll be in a very different position than we are now. As you know, I've worked very hard to make sure we have over 600 million doses of vaccine.
We're going to continue to make sure that's available. We're going to increase that number across the board as well so we can also be helping other nations once we take care of all Americans.
And what's happening now is, all the talk about how people were not going to get shots, they were not going to be involvedlook at what that waswe were told that was most likely to be among people over 65 years of age. But now people over 65 years of age, over 80 percent, have now been vaccinated and 66 percent fully vaccinated. And there's virtually no difference between White, Black, Hispanic, Asian American.
And sobecause what we've done, under some criticism, is we have expanded access to vaccinations to familiar places40,000 drugstores now. Also, all of the community health centers that are available all across the Nation. Mobile units going out. And it's getting better and better and better. And so that's why we're leading the world.
When I got elected, I said, in the first 100 days, we'd get 100 million people vaccinated. I was wrong; we got 230 million vaccinated.
I think you'll seeand there's a debate, you knowand I'll end with thisthere's a debate on what constitutes herd immunity. ""Is it 70 percent of the population? Is it 68 percent? Is it 81 percent?""
The point is that, by the end of the summerright now, every single person, 16 years or older, doesn't have to wait in linecan show up and get a vaccination now. My plea to everyone: Get vaccinated now please.
Thank you.

Hello, everyone. Great to be back in Philly. Great to be back at to 30th Street Station.
Blake, you didn'twe didn't treat each other like family, we are family.
Please sit down, guys. Sit down.
Your dad Gregg is here too. As far as I'm concerned, the Weavers are family. And, Justin Gray, speaking of family, your father and I fought a lot of fights together, planned a lot of those fights on Amtrak coming back to PhillyI didn't come all the way to Philly. It's a wonderful tribute to the station to bear his name.
And, Bill Flynn, thank you for having me. Governor Wolf, Mayor Kenney, Congressman Evans, thank you for the passport into the city. Appreciate it. And we have anotherI don't know that they're all here still, but I met a lot of really important friends that were here tofor this occasion.
I understand Senator Blumenthal is here. There you go. One of the great Senators, former attorney generaltook care of my son Beau when he was attorney general. Thank you very much.
And also, Dwight Evans. Dwight is here. You can't miss Dwight. Come on, Dwight, stand up there, man. And a good friend of mine, and worked like the devil to get me elected, Brendan Boyle. Brendan. That's the Irish of it, man. And Donald Payne, New Jersey. [Laughter] I keep telling, Donald, because Delaware is so small, it is a constitutionalthere was a case in the Supreme CourtDelaware, the State of, owns the Delaware River up to the high watermark in New Jersey. Just want you to know that. You got to treat us with more respect.
And Mayor Kenney, thanks for the passport. Great friend. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. You're doing a heck of a job.
And a real close, close friend, who was a cochairman of my campaign, and just a great friend isour whole timeGovernor Ed Rendell. Eddie, thank you, pal. This city owes you a lot.
And Tony Coscia, Chair of theChairman of the Board. And one of my best friends inin life, a guy named Bert DiClemente; we've known each other from high school. We went to rival high schools. Bert ran my operation in Delaware for years and years. The one election I got the most votes in was the last election I ran for the Senate. I was also running for Vice President at the timebecause, under Delaware law, if you're not out of the Senate race in a certain time period, you've got to stay in. And so Bert ranhe was the ""Senator"" in Delaware campaigning for me. He got more votes than I got. So, Bert, thank you very much.
Also, Justin Gray, I've mentioned Justin already and his dad. And Gregg Weaver, Jr.Gregg, you'reyou are family. I mean, excuse me, Blake is family. And Mary Kate, what a lovely kid.
And Bill Flynn of Amtrak.
You know, folks. The fact is that, if Iin the past when I've ended up at the 30th Street StationAmtrak stationit's probably because I took the late train back from Washington and I slept through the Delaware stopliterally, not figuratively. I only did it about four times. Butbut I would haveI wouldn't have missed this for the world.
It's an honor to celebrate Amtrak's 50th anniversary. And I look forward to a bright future for all of American rail.
You know, back in 2016, I announced a Federal loan that allowed Amtrak to purchase the new Acela trains. That's what you see behind me. And they look great. I can hardly wait to ride.
And they madethey're made in America, and I wanted to see more of that. That's why the investments in my American Jobs Plan are guided by one principle: buy American. Buy products that were made in America. And American tax dollars are going to be used to buy American products to create American jobs.
When I became Vice President, one of the Capitol Hill newspapers estimated that I had taken more than 7,000 round trips on Amtrak over my career. I think that's an exaggeration. And I'm going to rely onthere's two conductors that Mr. Weaver will remember. One of them was a guy named Angelo Negri. And Angelothere was an articlemyI guess, my fourth or fifth year as PresidentVice President, saying, ""Biden travels 1,0001,300,000 miles on Air Force One [Two].*""
And I used tothe Secret Service didn't like it, but I used to like to take the train home. My mom was sick, and I'd cometry to come home almost every weekend as Vice President to see her. And I was getting on the train, and Angelo Negri came up and he goes, ""Joey, baby!"" And he grabbed my cheek, started to squeeze it like he always did.
And I thought that he was going to get shot. [Laughter] I'm serious. And I said: ""No, no. He's a friend."" He said, ""Joey, what's the big deal? 1,200,000300,000 miles on Air Force Two. You know how many miles you traveled on Amtrak?"" I said, ""No, Ange, I don't know."" And he gave me the calculation, and he said, ""you traveled 1,515,000 miles on Amtrak."" So the fact is, I'd probably take Ange's word before I took the word of what the article said.
But the point is: In the process, as Conductor Weaver will tell you, Amtrak became my family. I literallyliterallyevery single day that I was in the United States Senate, got theeither the 7:28it became the 7:32, andorand got home onif I got lucky, I got the Metro that leftthe last one left at 6, or I got the 7:30 coming home.
And you get to know everybody. You get to know the folks. And I used to have a Christmas party for Amtrak employees at my home, and it got so big, we ended up having it a summer party because family and retirees kept coming back.
I want to tell you: These guys and women, they work like the devil. They really, really, really do. And Amtrak wasn't just a way of getting home. It provided me, and I'm not joking, an entire other familya community dedicatedthat were professional, and that we've shared milestones in my life. And I've been allowed to share milestones in theirs.
I've been to an awful lot of weddings and christenings and, unfortunately, some burials as well. We're family. You know, I remember one night, my daughter was only 6 years old, and it was my birthday. And we were voting, and I went to Bob Dole, and I said, ""Bob, when's the next vote going to take place?"" He said, ""Joe, whatwhy?"" I said, ""Well, my daughter is really upset I'm not going to be able to be home for the birthday cake she made for me.""
He said, ""What do you need?"" I said, ""I need just time to catch the 5 o'clock Metro, and I can get the 6:28 coming back,"" because on the platform, you can justin Delaware, you walk from one side to the other. I got off the train. My wife Jill was standing there, and my daughter had the cake, candle lit. I blew them out. Gave me a kiss. Walked across and got on the southbound.
So, it has been part of my life. I've been riding an Amtrak for almost as long as there's been an Amtrak. And I've come to see that Amtrak doesn't just carry us from one place to another; it opens up enormous possibilities. And especially now, it makes it possible to build an economy of the future and one that we need.
Last week, I announced the target of cutting greenhouse gases and gas emissions in half by 2030. And most of thatof those emissions in this countyin this country come from transportation. But if just 10 percent of the freight shipped in the largest trucks went by rail instead, we'd be removing 3,300,000 cars from the road. And we've been plantingit's the same as doing that are planting 260 million trees in America.
And, as I've said from the beginning, when I think about fighting climate change, I think about jobs. And railand, hopefully, the expansion of railprovides good union jobs, good-paying jobs. It also connects people to jobs and economic opportunities that can be reached from wherever you live.
Let's put this in perspective: For years, I fought efforts to cut funding for Amtrak because cutting funding for Amtrak would be a disaster for our environment and our economy. Amtrak carries four times as many riders between Washington and New York City as every single airline does within 50 miles of the shore, from Florida all the way up the coast.
Imagine what we'd have to doa single day without the Northeast Corridor, for examplewith Amtrak and the Northeast Corridorwould cost the economy $100 million. If you shut down all passenger service on Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, the projects that compensate for the lossyou'd have to add seven new lanes of highway on I-95. And consider that cost: average of $30 million for a linear mile on I-95.
This is a bargain of bargains of bargains. It's economical, and it's, environmentally, a lifesaver. That's why, in my Rescue PlanAmerican Rescue Planwe've worked hard to keep Amtrak running. At the height of the pandemic, because we weren't traveling, Amtrak furloughed 1 million1,200 employees. And we were able to provide emergency relief to keep rail service running. And we've now brought back 1,200 union workers who had been furloughed. And by the way, you get a union wage, not 15 bucks an hour, a prevailing wage.
But we have to do more than just build back; we have to build back better. And today, we have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to position Amtrak and rail and intercity rail as well, in general, to play a central role in our transformation in transportation and economic future, to make investments that can help America get back on track, no pun intended.
Before the pandemic hit, Amtrak's ridership and revenues were on the upswing. The Northeast Corridor has been making money for a long while now, but last year, the whole of Amtrak system was projected to break even for the first time in history. But then, we had the pandemic.
But there's still a huge backlog of deferred maintenance, a huge need to modernize our trains, our stations, our bridges, our tunnels. But we're talking about critical jobs like the Hudson River Tunnel, the Baltimore Potomac Tunnel, the Susquehanna River Bridge. In my American Jobs Plan, I proposed spending $10 billion a year on passenger rail and freight rail. Of this, two-thirds would support existing Amtrak routes, including the Northeast Corridor, but nationwide.
And we're talking about union jobs, as I said. And we're taking care of the riders, laying track, wiring switches, fixing bridges, tunnels, modernizing stations, and repairing and rebuilding this vital infrastructure.
This would allow for athe potential to expand passenger rail service. Imagine a 2-hour train ride between Atlanta and Charlotte going at speeds of 220 miles an hour. And 2-hour trip between Chicago and Detroit. Or faster and more regular trips between Los Angeles and Las Vegas, a route that I imagine could be pretty popular on Fridays.
Bill, as you've said, your vision for Amtrak calls for a new intercity rail service, up to 160 previously unserved communities being connected. Think of what it will mean for opportunity if we can connect Milwaukee to Green Bay to Madison, Scranton and Allentown to New York, Indianapolis to Louisville, and much, much more.
It's going to provide jobs. It will also accommodate jobs. And what this means is that towns and cities that have been in danger of being left out and left behind will be back in the game. It means families don't have to sacrifice the cost of living or quality, of access to opportunity that sometimes only occurs if they live in a big city.
We have a huge opportunity here to provide fast, safe, reliable, clean transportation in this country. And transit is part of the infrastructure. And like the rest of our infrastructure, we're way behind the rest of the world right now.
We need to remember: We're in competition with the rest of the world. People come here and set up businesses. People stay here, people grow because of the ability to access: access transportation, access all the infrastructure. It's what allows us to compete andwith the rest of the world to win the 21st century. We've got to move.
China already has 23,000 miles of high-speed rail220 miles per hourtwo-thirds of all the high-speed rail in the world. Two-hundred and twenty miles an hour. And the wayand they're working on transit, on trains, that can go as high as 400 miles an hour.
We're behind the curve. But, folks, as I said the other night, America is on the move again. We need to remember that we're in the United States of America. There's nothing beyond our capacity, nothing we can't do if we do it together.
And we celebrate Amtrak's birthday. I was thinking about AmericaAmtrak's role, as I said, on my birthday, when they allowed me to come home and blow out that candle. There's a lot of things that Amtrak does. And you know, the fact of the matter is, if we're able towhich is now beyond the ability to pay for itbut if we're able to straighten out three curves from Washington to New York, you could make it from Washington to New York in an hour and 32 minutesan hour and 32 minutes.
Folks, there's so much we can do. And it has such an incredibly positive impact on the environment, incredibly positive impact on workpresenton opportunities. And again, all the things we have to do to put Amtrak in place and be one of the great, great contributors to our country is, we have to invest.
And so, you know, if you think about it. When we werewhen I was Vice President with Barack, he allowed me to put together a budget for Amtrak. And it had money for high-speed rail at 200 miles an hour fromexcuse me, from Charlotteoneanother line going fromin Florida down to Tampa. Another lineif we had moved, Gov, we'd have that tunnel fixed in New York now. The money was there to get it done. There's so much we can do. And it's the biggest bang for the buck we can expend.
So, on this momentous birthday of Amtrak, I want toI want to thank you for making so many birthdays possible. I believe that the best days for Amtrak and for rail and for America are ahead. I really believe that.
And I'm just confidentI'm confidentwe can get this done. And I must tell you, I'm anxious to see the new train.
Thank you all so very much. God Bless America. And may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

The President's Visit With Former President James E. Carter, Jr., and First Lady Rosalynn Carter 
Q. How was your visit with the Carters today, sir?
The President. It was great. It was great to see President Carter. He reminded me that I was the first person to endorse him outside of Georgia. And we sat and talked about the old days. And he introduced me to a friend of his, a reverend who he wanted me to get to know. And Rosalynn was great too. We just had a nice time. It was justthey're old friends.
Q. How is his health been?
The President. His health has gotten better. I mean, heyou know, he's reallyit's amazing. He keeps bouncing back. And we talked a little bit about cancer research and a few other things. But it's just great to see him.
Alleged Directed Energy Attack at the White House Ellipse 
Q. Mr. President, what do you know about this supposed direct energy attack on the Ellipse and the person who was injured?
The President. I don't know anything about it.
Q. So you have not been briefed on it?
The President. I have not been briefed on it.
The President's Rally in Duluth, Georgia/Federal Use of Private Detention Facilities 
Q. What did you make of the protesters tonight at your rally, sir?
The President. Well, when they found out I had agreed with them, they finally stopped. Because I've been opposed to funding private prisons, and that's what they were talking about. But I think they were just very emotionally excited. That's why I stopped and let them go on a little bit, and then told them where I[inaudible]. And when they found outthey wanted me to do it immediately, like I could sign a paper and make it happen. But I
Q. You said you[inaudible]in 5 more days.
The President. Yes.
Q. That's not going to be enough, is it?
The President. No, no[inaudible]. I was teasing aboutyou know, I can't getI have to get it passed. And that's what Ibut I do support eliminating funding to private prisons.
Q. Does that extend to ICE?
Senator Shelley Moore Capito/Infrastructure and Jobs Legislation 
Q. Can you tell us more about your conversation with Senator Capito?
The President. We had a good conversation. And I invited her to come with anyone she wants to bring with her to the White House. And they're off next weekthe Senateso I said: ""If you wanted to come next week, that's fine. But if you want to wait and have our staff talk some more."" But she seemed very positive about wanting to do something serious about it. And I'm anxious to hear what they have to say.
Q. [Inaudible]opportunity for common ground if you want to raise taxes to pay for this and they say, ""That's a nonstarter""?
The President. Well, if they say, ""We're not going to pay for it,"" then that's back to the old Republican position of, you know, cut taxes$2 trillion, go into debt, and not pay. I mean, it's ironic how thehow this has all changed.
So I told her that we could do it in two ways. Let's decide on infrastructurewhat they think is infrastructure. So if the first piece of it is they don't think broadband is infrastructureI'm not saying she says that either.
But let's decide what iswhat are they prepared to consider in terms of what constitutes infrastructure, how much of it, and then we can talk about how to pay for it if we get to the point that we actually have a real number.
But if it's like last timeand I don'tI think she's seriousbut if, like last time, they come in with one-fourth or one-fifth of what I'm asking and say, ""That's a final offer,"" then there'syou know, it's a no-go for me. Then, we have to go and
Police Reform Legislation 
Q. [Inaudible]Senator Tim Scott to the White House to talk about police reform? Are you planning
The President. Well, no, I'd happy to have him at the White House, but right now he has a serious negotiation going on with Senator Booker. And we should let the Senate work its will on how they're going to move that.
Q. And how much of a role would you play in that? Are you going to
The President. No, I wouldn't play a role in that at all, other than, I've made my position clear what it is, and let them negotiate. If theyif it's a negotiation that I can support, then that's fine. If it's not, then I will be prepared to continue tothe negotiation.
Gun Control Legislation 
Q. [Inaudible]really successful Climate Summit. Do you need to call a gun summit if you want to get something done on guns?
The President. Well, I don't think a guns summit is the way it is going to go. I think there's certain things that have already been passed in the House. It should bethey should do it. It's time for the Congress to step up.
And one of the things that I've been doing and I'm going to continue to do is make the case to the American people: This makes no sense. The idea that over 250 people were shot dead between the first time I came down and the second mass murder a week laterI mean, this isit's absolutelyand, by the way, a significant portion of gun owners and NRA members support eliminating the assault weapons. And who the hell needs 100 rounds in a gun that canI mean, so, the vast majority of the American people are getting fed up with it. And I think, eventually, that's going to break the back of whatthe opposition.
But look, there's a lot on the plate. What I've got to figure out is what can I get done, when. It's a matter of sequencing a lot of things. There's a lot going on, and it's only been 101 days.
Thank you.

2021-04-28 00:00:00,Address Before a Joint Session of the Congress,"
The President. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Good to be back. As Mitch and Chuck will understand, it's good to be almost home, down the hall. [Laughter] Anyway, thank you all.
Madam Speaker, Madam Vice Presidentno President has ever said those words from this podium. No President has ever said those words, and it's about time.
First LadyI'm her husband; Second Gentleman; Chief Justice; Members of the United States Congress and the Cabinet; distinguished guests; my fellow Americans: While the setting tonight is familiar, this gathering is just a little bit different, a reminder of the extraordinary times we're in.
Throughout our history, Presidents have come to this Chamber to speak to Congress, to the Nation, and to the world; to declare war, to celebrate peace; to announce new plans and possibilities. Tonight I come to talk about crisis and opportunity, about rebuilding the Nation, revitalizing our democracy, and winning the future for America.
I stand here tonight, 1 day shy of the hundredth day of my administration, hundred days since I took the oath of office and lifted my hand off our family Bible and inherited a Nationwe all didthat was in crisis: the worst pandemic in a century, the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War.
Now, after just 100 days, I can report to the Nation: America is on the move again, turning peril into possibility, crisis to opportunity, setbacks into strength. We all know life can knock us down. But, in America, we never, ever, ever stay down. Americans always get up. Today, that's what we're doing: America is rising anew, choosing hope over fear, truth over lies, and light over darkness.
After 100 days of rescue and renewal, America is ready for takeoff, in my view. We're working again, dreaming again, discovering again, and leading the world again. We have shown each other and the world that there's no quit in Americanone.
One hundred days ago, America's house was on fire. And we had to act. And thanks to the extraordinary leadership of Speaker Pelosi; Majority Leader Schumer; and the overwhelming support of the American peopleDemocrats, Independents, and Republicanswe did act. Together we passed the American Rescue Plan, one of the most consequential rescue packages in American history. We're already seeing the results. [Applause] We're already seeing the results.
After I promised we'd get 100 million COVID-19 vaccine shots into people's arms in 100 days, we will have provided over 220 million COVID shots in those 100 days. Thanks to all the help of all of you, we're marshalingwith your help, everyone's helpwe're marshaling every Federal resource. We've gotten vaccines to nearly 40,000 pharmacies and over 700 community health centers where the poorest of the poor can be reached. We're setting up community vaccination sites, developing mobile units to get to hard-to-reach communities.
Today, 90 percent of Americans now live within 5 miles of a vaccination site. Everyone over the age of 16everyoneis now eligible to get vaccinated right now, right away. Go get vaccinated, America. Go and get the vaccination. They're available. You're eligible now.
When I was sworn in on January 20, less than 1 percent of the seniors in America were fully vaccinated against COVID-19. One hundred days later, 70 percent of seniors in America over 65 are protectedfully protected. Senior deaths from COVID-19 are down 80 percent since Januarydown 80 percentbecause of all of you. And more than half of all the adults in America have gotten at least one shot.
At a mass vaccination center in Glendale, Arizona, I asked the nurseI said, ""What's it like?"" She looked at me, and she said, ""It's like every shot is giving a dose of hope""was her phrase. ""A dose of hope.""
A dose of hope for an educator in Florida who has a child suffering from an autoimmune diseasewrote to me, said she's worriedthat she was worrying about bringing the virus home. She said she then got vaccinated at a large site, in her car. She said she sat in her car, when she got vaccinated and just cried, cried out of joy and cried out of relief.
Parents seeing the smiles on their kids' faces, for those who are able to go back to school because the teachers and school bus drivers and cafeteria workers have been vaccinated. Grandparents hugging their children and grandchildren instead of pressing hands against a window to say goodbye. It means everything. Those things mean everything.
You know, there's stillyou all know it; you know it better than any group of Americansthere's still more work to do to beat this virus. We can't let our guard down.
But tonight I can say it: Because of you, the American people, our progress these past hundred days against one of the worst pandemics in history has been one of the greatest logistical achievementslogistical achievementsthis country has ever seen.
What else have we done in those first hundred days?
We kept our commitmentDemocrats and Republicansof sending $1,400 rescue checks to 85 percent of American households. We've already sent more than 160 million checks out the door. It's making the difference. You all know it when you go home. For many people, it's making all the difference in the world.
The single mom in Texas who wrote to me, she said she couldn't work, but she said the relief check put food on the table and saved her and her son from eviction from their apartment. A grandmother in Virginia who told me she immediately took her granddaughter to the eye doctor, something she said she put off for months because she didn't have the money.
One of the defining images, at least from my perspective, in this crisis has been cars lined up, cars lined up for miles. And not people who just barely ever start those cars, nice cars lined up for miles, waiting for a box of food to be put in their trunk. I don't know about you, but I didn't ever think I'd see that in America. And all of this is through no fault of their own. No fault of their own, these people are in this position.
That's why the Rescue Plan is delivering food and nutrition assistance to millions of Americans facing hunger, and hunger is down sharply already. We're also providing rental assistanceyou all know this, but the American people, I want to make sure they understandkeeping people from being evicted from their homes, providing loans to small businesses to reopen and keep their employees on the job.
During these 100 days, an additional 800,000 Americans enrolled in the Affordable Care Act when I established the special signup period to do that800,000 in that period. We're making one of the largest one-time ever investmentseverin improving health care for veterans. Critical investments to address the opioid crisis. And, maybe most importantly, thanks to the American Rescue Plan, we're on track to cut child poverty in America in half this year.
And, in the process, while this was all going on, the economy created more than 1,300,000 new jobs in 100 days, more jobs in the first 100 days than any President on record. The International Monetary Fund is now estimating our economy will grow at a rate of more than 6 percent this year. That will be the fastest pace of economic growth in this country in nearly four decades.
America is movingmoving forwardbut we can't stop now. We're in competition with China and other countries to win the 21st century. We're at a great inflection point in history. We have to do more than just build back betterI mean, ""build back."" We have to build back better. We have to compete more strenuously than we have.
Throughout our history, if you think about it, public investment in infrastructure has literally transformed America: our attitudes, as well as our opportunities. The transcontinental railroad, the interstate highways united two oceans and brought a totally new age of progress to the United States of America. Universal public schools and college aid opened wide the doors of opportunity. Scientific breakthroughs took us to the Moonnow we're on Marsdiscovering vaccines, gave us the internet, and so much more.
These are the investments we made together as one country, and investments that only the Government was in a position to make. Time and again, they propel us into the future. That's why I proposed the American Jobs Plan, a once-in-a-generation investment in America itself. This is the largest jobs plan since World War II. It creates jobs to upgrade our transportation infrastructure; jobs modernizing our roads, bridges, highways; jobs building ports and airports, rail corridors, transit lines.
It's clean water. And, today, up to 10 million homes in America and more than 400,000 schools and childcare centers have pipes with lead in them, including in drinking water, a clear and present danger to our children's health.
The American Jobs Plan creates jobs replacing 100 percent of the Nation's lead pipes and service lines so every American can drink clean water. And, in the process, it will create thousands and thousands of good-paying jobs. It creates jobs connecting every American with high-speed internet, including 35 percent of the rural America that still doesn't have it. This is going to help our kids and our businesses succeed in the 21st-century economy.
And I'm asking the Vice President to lead this effort, if she would
Vice President Kamala D. Harris. Of course.
The President. because I know it will get done.
It creates jobs, building a modern power grid. Our grids are vulnerable to storms, hacks, catastrophic failures, with tragic results, as we saw in Texas and elsewhere during the winter storms. The American Jobs Plan will create jobs that will lay thousands of miles of transmission lines needed to build a resilient and fully clean grid. We can do that.
Look, the American Jobs Plan will help millions of people get back to their jobs and back to their careers. Two million women have dropped out of the workforce during this pandemic2 million, and too often because they couldn't get the care they needed to care for their child or care for an elderly parent who needs help.
Eight hundred thousand families are on a Medicare waiting list right now to get homecare for their aging parent or loved one with a disability. If you think it's not important, check out in your own district, Democrat or Republican. Democrat or Republican voters, their great concernalmost as much as their childrenis taking care of an elderly loved one who can't be left alone. Medicaid contemplated it, but this plan is going to help those families and create jobs for our caregivers with better wages and better benefits, continuing a cycle of growth.
For too long, we've failed to use the most important word when it comes to meeting the climate crisis: ""jobs."" Jobs. Jobs. For me, when I think ""climate change,"" I think ""jobs.""
The American Jobs Plan will put engineers and construction workers to work building more energy-efficient buildings and homes; electrical workersIBEW membersinstalling 500,000 charging stations along our highways so we can own the electric car market. Farmersfarmers planting cover crops so they can reduce the carbon dioxide in the air and get paid for doing it.
Look, but think about it: There is simply no reason why the blades for wind turbines can't be built in Pittsburgh instead of Beijing. No reason. None. No reason. So, folks, there's no reason why American workers can't lead the world in the production of electric vehicles and batteries. I mean, there is no reason. We have this capacity. We have the brightest, best trained people in the world.
The American Jobs Plan is going to create millions of good-paying jobsjobs Americans can raise a family onas my dad would then say, ""with a little breathing room."" And all the investments in the American Jobs Plan will be guided by one principle: buy American. Buy American. And I might note, parenthetically, that does not violate any trade agreement. It's been the law since the thirties: buy American.
American tax dollars are going to be used to buy American products made in America to create American jobs. That's the way it's supposed to be and it will be in this administration. And I made it clear to all my Cabinet people. Their ability to give exemptions has been strenuously limited. It will be American products.
Now I know some of you at home are wondering whether these jobs are for you. So many of youso many of the folks I grew up withfeel left behind, forgotten in an economy that's so rapidly changing it's frightening. I want to speak directly to you. Because if you think about it, that's what people are most worried about: ""Can I fit in?""
Independent experts estimate the American Jobs Plan will add millions of jobs and trillions of dollars to economic growth in the years to come. It is an 8-year program. These are good-paying jobs that can't be outsourced.
Nearly 90 percent of the infrastructure jobs created in the American Jobs Plan do not require a college degree; 75 percent don't require an associate's degree. The American Jobs Plan is a blue-collar blueprint to build America. That's what it is.
And it recognizes something I've always said in this Chamber and the other. Good guys and women on Wall Street, but Wall Street didn't build this country. The middle class built the country, and unions built the middle class. So that's why I'm calling on Congress to pass the Protect the Right to Organize Actthe PRO Actand send it to my desk so we can support the right to unionize.
And by the way, while you're thinking about sending things to my desk[laughter]let's raise the minimum wage to $15. No oneno one working 40 hours a weekno one working 40 hours a week should live below the poverty line.
We need to ensure greater equity and opportunity for women. And while we're doing this, let's get the Paycheck Fairness Act to my desk as wellequal pay. It's been much too long. And if you're wondering whether it's too long, look behind me.
And finally, the American Jobs Plan will be the biggest increase in nondefense research and development on record. We will see more technological changeand some of you know more about this than I dowe'll see more technological change in the next 10 years than we saw in the last 50. That's how rapidly artificial intelligence and so much more is changing.
And we're falling behind the competition with the rest of the world. Decades ago, we used to invest 2 percent of our gross domestic product in America2 percent of our gross domestic productin research and development.
Today, Mr. Secretary, that's less than 1 percent. China and other countries are closing in fast. We have to develop and dominate the products and technologies of the future: advanced batteries, biotechnology, computer chips, clean energy.
The Secretary of Defense can tell youand those of you onwho work on national security issues knowthe Defense Department has an agency called DARPAthe Defense Advanced Research Project Agency. The people who set up before I came hereand that's been a long time agoto develop breakthroughs that enhance our national securitythat's their only job. And it's a semiseparate agency; it's under the Defense Department. It's led to everything from the discovery of the internet to GPS and so much more that's enhanced our security.
The National Institute of Healththe NIHI believe, should create a similar Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. And that wouldhere's what it would do. It would have a singular purpose: to develop breakthroughs to prevent, detect, and treat diseases like Alzheimer's, diabetes, and cancer.
I'll still never forget when we passed the cancer proposal the last year I was Vice Presidentalmost $9 million going to NIH. And if you excuse the point of personal privilege, I'll never forget you standing, Mitch, and saying you'd name it after my deceased son. It meant a lot.
But so many of us have deceased sons, daughters, and relatives who died of cancer. I can think of no more worthy investment. I know of nothing that is more bipartisan. So let's end cancer as we know it. It's within our power. It's within our power to do it.
Investments in jobs and infrastructure, like the ones we're talking about, have often had bipartisan support in the past. Vice President Harris and I met regularly in the Oval Office with Democrats and Republicans to discuss the Jobs Plan. And I applaud a group of Republican Senators who just put forward their own proposal.
So let's get to work. I wanted to lay out, before the Congress, my plan before we got into the deep discussions. I'd like to meet with those who have ideas that are differentthey think are better. I welcome those ideas.
But the rest of the world is not waiting for us. I just want to be clear: From my perspective, doing nothing is not an option. Look, we can't be so busy competing with one another that we forget the competition that we have with the rest of the world to win the 21st century.
Secretary Blinken can tell you, I spent a lot of time with President Xi: traveled over 17,000 miles with him; spent, they tell me, over 24 hours in private discussions with him. When he called to congratulate me, we had a 2-hour discussion. He's deadly earnest about becoming the most significant, consequential nation in the world. He and othersautocratsthink that democracy can't compete in the 21st century with autocracies because it takes too long to get consensus.
To win that competition for the future, in my view, we also need to make a once-in-a-generation investment in our families and our children. That's why I've introduced the American Families Plan tonight, which addresses four of the biggest challenges facing American families and, in turn, America.
First is access to a good education. When this Nation made 12 years of public education universal in the last century, it made us the best educated, best prepared Nation in the world. It's, I believe, the overwhelming reason that propelled us to where we got in the 21stin the 20th century.
But the world has caught up, or catching up. They are not waiting. I would say, parenthetically: If we were sitting down, put a bipartisan committee together and said, ""Okay, we're going to decide what we do in terms of government providing for free education,"" I wonder whether we'd think, as we did in the 20th century, that 12 years is enough in the 21st century. I doubt it. Twelve years is no longer enough today to compete with the rest of the world in the 21st century. That's why my American Families Plan guarantees 4 additional years of public education for every person in America, starting as early as we can.
The great universities of this country have conducted studies over the last 10 years. It shows that adding 2 years of universal high-quality preschool for every 3-year-old and 4-year-old, no matter what background they come from, it puts them in the position to be able to compete all the way through 12 years. It increases exponentially their prospect of graduating and going on beyond graduation. The research shows when a young child goes to schoolnot daycarethey are far more likely to graduate from high school and go to college or something after high school.
When you add 2 years of free community college on top of that, you begin to change the dynamic. We can do that.
And we'll increase Pell Grants and invest in Historical Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges, Minority-Serving Institutions. The reason is: They don't have the endowments, but their students are just as capable of learning about cybersecurity, just as capable of learning about metallurgyall the things that are going on that provide those jobs of the future.
Jill is a community college professor who teaches today as First Lady. She's long saidif I've heard it once, I've heard it a thousand times: ""Joe, any country that outeducates us is going to outcompete us."" She'll be deeply involved in leading this effort. Thank you, Jill.
Second thing we need: American Families Plan will provide access to quality, affordable childcare. We guaranteeand I'm proposing a legislation to guarantee that low- and middle-income families will pay no more than 7 percent of their income for high-quality care for children up to the age of 5. The most hard-pressed working families won't have to spend a dime.
Third, the American Families Plan will finally provide up to 12 weeks of paid leave and medical leavefamily and medical leave. We're one of the few industrial countries in the world. No one should have to choose between a job and paycheck or taking care of themselves and their loved onesa parent, a spouse, or child.
And fourth, the American Family Plan puts directly into the pockets of millions of Americans. In March, we expanded a tax credit for every child in a family. Up to $3,000 per child, if they're under 6 years of ageI mean, excuse meunderover [under]* 6 years of age, and $3,600 for children over 6 years of age.
With two parents, two kids, that's $7,200 in the pockets that's going to help to take care of your family. And that will help more than 65 million children and help cut childcare [child]* poverty in half. And we can afford it. So we did that in the last piece of legislation we passed. But let's extend that childcare tax credit at least through the end of 2025.
The American Rescue Plan lowered health care premiums for 9 million Americans who buy their coverage under the Affordable Care Act. I know that's really popular on this side of the aisle. [Laughter] But let's make that provision permanent so their premiums don't go back up.
In addition to my Families Plan, I'm going to work with Congress to address, this year, other critical priorities for American families. The Affordable Care Act has been a lifeline for millions of Americans, protecting people with preexisting conditions, protecting women's health. And the pandemic has demonstrated how badlyhow badlyit's needed. Let's lower deductibles for working families on the Affordable Carein the Affordable Care Act. And let's lower prescription drug costs.
We know how to do this. The last President had that as an objective. We all know how outrageously expensive drugs are in America. In fact, we pay the highest prescription drug prices of anywhere in the world right here in Americanearly three timesfor the same drug, nearly three times what other countries pay. We have to change that, and we can.
Let's do what we've always talked about for all the years I was down here in this bodyin Congress. Let's give Medicare the power to save hundreds of billions of dollars by negotiating lower drug prescription prices. And by the way, it won't just help people on Medicare, it will lower prescription drug costs for everyone.
And the money we save, which is billions of dollars, can go to strengthen the Affordable Care Act and expand Medicare coverage benefits without costing taxpayers an additional penny. It's within our power to do it; let's do it now. We've talked about it long enough. Democrats and Republicans, let's get it done this year. This is all about a simple premise: Health care should be a right and not a privilege in America.
So how do we pay for my Jobs and Family Plan? I made it clear, we can do it without increasing the deficits. Let's start with what I will not do: I will not impose any tax increase on people making less than $400,000. It'sbut it's time for corporate America and the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans to just begin to pay their fair share. Just their fair share.
Sometimes, I have arguments with my friends in the Democratic Party. I think you should be able to become a billionaire and a millionaire, but pay your fair share.
A recent study shows that 55 of the nation's biggest corporations paid zero Federal tax last year. Those 55 corporations made in excess of $40 billion in profit. A lot of companies also evade taxes through tax havens in Switzerland and Bermuda and the Cayman Islands. And they benefit from tax loopholes and deductions for offshoring jobs and shifting profits overseas. It's not right.
We're going to reform corporate taxes so they pay their fair share and help pay for the public investments their businesses will benefit from as well. And we're going to reward work, not just wealth. We take the top tax bracket for the wealthiest 1 percent of Americansthose making over $400,000 or moreback up to where it was when George W. Bush was President when he started: 39.6 percent. That's where it was when George W. was President.
We're going to get rid of the loopholes that allow Americans who make more than a million dollars a year and pay a lower tax rate on their capital gains than Americans who receive a paycheck. We're only going to affect three-tenths of 1 percent of all Americans by that actionthree-tenths of 1 percent. And the IRS is going to crack down on millionaires and billionaires who cheat on their taxes. It's estimated to be billions of dollars by think tanks that are left, right, and center.
I'm not looking to punish anybody. But I will not add a tax burdenadditional tax burden to the middle class in this country. They're already paying enough. I believe what I propose is fair, fiscally responsible, and it raises revenue to pay for the plans I have proposed and will create millions of jobs that will grow the economy and enhance our financial standing in the country.
When you hear someone say that they don't want to raise taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent or corporate America, ask them: ""Whose taxes you want to raise instead? Whose are you going to cut?""
Look, the big tax cut of 2017, remember, it was supposed to pay for itselfthat was how it was soldand generate vast economic growth. Instead, it added $2 trillion to the deficit. It was a huge windfall for corporate America and those at the very top.
Instead of using the tax saving to raise wages and invest in research and development, it poured billions of dollars into the pockets of CEOs. In fact, the pay gap between CEOs and their workers is now among the largest in history. According to one study, CEOs make 320 times what the average worker in their corporation makes. It used to be in thebelow a hundred.
The pandemic has only made things worse. Twenty million Americans lost their job in the pandemic: working and middle class Americans. At the same time, roughly 650 billionaires in America saw their net worth increase by more than $1 trillion, in the same exact period. Let me say it again: 650 people increased their wealth by more than $1 trillion during this pandemic. And they're now worth more than $4 trillion.
My fellow Americans, trickle-downtrickle-downeconomics has never worked, and it's time to grow the economy from the bottom and the middle out. You know, there's a broad consensus of economistsleft, right, centerand they agree what I'm proposing will help create millions of jobs and generate historic economic growth. These are among the highest value investments we can make as a Nation.
I've often said: Our greatest strength is the power of our example, not just the example of our power. In my conversations with world leadersand I've spoken to over 38, 40 of them nowI've made it knownI've made it knownthat America is back. And you know what they say? The comment that I hear most of all from them is they say: ""We see America is back, but for how long? But for how long?""
My fellow Americans, we have to show not just that we're back, but that we're back to stay and that we aren't going to go it alone. We're going to do it by leading with our allies. No one nation can deal with all the crises of our timefrom terrorism, to nuclear proliferation, mass migration, cybersecurity, climate change, as well as experiencingwhat we're experiencing now with pandemics.
There's no wall high enough to keep any virus out. And our own vaccine supply, as it grows to meet our needsand we're meeting themwill become an arsenal for vaccines for other countries, just as America was the arsenal of democracy for the world and, in consequence, influenced the world.
But every American will have access before that occursevery American will have access to be fully covered by COVID-19 from the vaccines we have.
Look, the climate crisis is not our fight alone, it's a global fight. The United States accounts, as all of you know, less than 15 percent of carbon emissions. The rest of the world accounts for 85 percent. That's why I kept my commitment to rejoin the Paris accordbecause if we do everything perfectly, it's not going to ultimately matter.
I kept my commitment to convene a climate summit right here in America with all of the major economies of the worldChina, Russia, India, the European Unionand I said I'd do it in my first hundred days.
I want to be very blunt about it: I hadmy attempt was to make sure that the world could see there was a consensus, that we are at an inflection point in history. And consensusthe consensus is: If we act to save the planet, we can create millions of jobs and economic growth and opportunity to raise the standard of living to almost everyone around the world. If you've watched any of itand you were all busy; I'm sure you didn't have much timethat's what virtually every nation said, even the ones that aren't doing their fair share.
The investments I've proposed tonight also advance the foreign policy, in my view, that benefits the middle class. That means making sure every nation plays by the same rules in the global economy, including China.
My discussionsin my discussions with President Xi, I told him, ""We welcome the competition. We're not looking for conflict."" But I made absolutely clear that we will defend America's interests across the board. America will stand up to unfair trade practices that undercut American workers and American industries, like subsidies from stateto state-owned operations and enterprises and the theft of American technology and intellectual property.
I also told President Xi that we'll maintain a strong military presence in the Indo-Pacific, just as we do with NATO in Europe, not to start a conflict, but to prevent one. I told him what I've said to many world leaders: that America will not back away from our commitmentsour commitment to human rights and fundamental freedoms and to our alliances.
And I pointed out to him: No responsible American President could remain silent when basic human rights are being so blatantly violated. An American President has to represent the essence of what our country stands for. America is an idea, the most unique idea in history: We are created, all of us, equal. It's who we are, and we cannot walk away from that principle and, in fact, say we're dealing with the American idea.
With regard to Russia, I know it concerns some of you, but I made very clear to Putin that we're not going to seekexcuse meescalation, but their actions will have consequence if they turn out to be true. And they turned out to be true, so I responded directly and proportionally to Russia's interference in our elections and the cyber attacks on our Government and our business. They did both of these things, and I told them we would respond, and we have.
But we can also cooperate when it's in our mutual interest. We did it when we extended the New START Treaty on nuclear arms, and we're working to do it on climate change. But he understands we will respond.
On Iran and North Koreanuclear programs that present serious threats to American security and the security of the worldwe're going to be working closely with our allies to address the threats posed by both of these countries through diplomacy, as well as stern deterrence.
And American leadership means ending the forever war in Afghanistan. We have, without hyperbole, the greatest fighting force in the history of the world. I'm the first President in 40 years who knows what it means to have a son serving in a war zone. Today, we have servicemembers serving in the same war zone as their parents did. We have servicemembers in Afghanistan who were not yet born on 9/11.
The war in Afghanistan, as we remember the debates here, were never meant to be multigenerational undertakings of nation-building. We went to Afghanistan to get terroriststhe terrorists who attacked us on 9/11and we said we would follow Usama bin Laden to the gates of hell to do it. If you've been to the upper Kunar Valley, you've kind of seen the gates of hell. And we delivered justice to bin Laden. We degraded the terrorist threat of Al Qaida in Afghanistan. And after 20 years of valuevalor and sacrifice, it's time to bring those troops home.
Look, even as we do, we will maintain an over-the-horizon capacity to suppress future threats to the homeland. And make no mistake: In 20 years, terrorists hasterrorism has metastasized. The threat has evolved way beyond Afghanistan. And those of you in the intelligence committees, the foreign relations committee, the defense committees, you know well: We have to remain vigilant against the threats to the United States wherever they come from. Al Qaida and ISIS are in Yemen, Syria, Somalia, other places in Africa, the Middle East, and beyond.
And we won't ignore what our intelligence agencies have determined to be the most lethal terrorist threat to the homeland today: White supremacy is terrorism. We're not going to ignore that either.
My fellow Americans, look, we have to come together to heal the soul of this Nation. It was nearly a year ago, before her father's funeral, when I spoke with Gianna Floyd, George Floyd's young daughter. She's a little tyke, so I was kneeling down to talk to her so I could look her in the eye. And she looked at me and she said, ""My daddy changed the world."" Well, after the conviction of George Floyd's murderer, we can see how right she was if we have the courage to act as a Congress.
We've all seen the knee of injustice on the neck of Black Americans. Now is our opportunity to make some real progress. The vast majority of men and women wearing the uniform and a badge serve our communities, and they serve them honorably. I know them. I know they want to help meet this moment as well.
My fellow Americans, we have to come together to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the people they serve, to root out systemic racism in our criminal justice system, and to enact police reform in George Floyd's name that passed the House already. I know Republicans have their own ideas and are engaged in the very productive discussions with Democrats in the Senate. We need to work together to find a consensus. But let's get it done next month, by the first anniversary of George Floyd's death.
The country supports this reform, and Congress should actshould act. We have a giant opportunity to bend to the arc of the moral universe towards justicereal justice. And with the plans outlined tonight, we have a real chance to root out systemic racism that plagues America and American lives in other ways; a chance to deliver real equitygood jobs, good schools, affordable housing, clean air, clean water, being able to generate wealth and pass it down two generations because you have an access to purchase a house. Real opportunities in the lives of more Americans: Black, White, Latino, Asian Americans, Native Americans.
Look, I also want to thank the United States Senate for voting 94 to 1 to pass the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act to protect Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. You acted decisively. And you can see on television the viciousness of the hate crimes we've seen over the past yearthis past year and for too long. I urge the House to do the same and send that legislation to my desk, which I will gladly, anxiously sign.
I also hope Congress can get to my desk the Equality Act to protect LGBTQ Americans. To all transgender Americans watching at home, especially young people who are so brave, I want you to know your President has your back.
Another thing: Let's authorize the Violence Against Women Act, which has been law for 27 years. Twenty-seven years ago, I wrote it. It will close thethe act that has to be authorized now will close the ""boyfriend"" loophole to keep guns out of the hands of abusers. The court order said: ""This is an abuser. You can't own a gun."" It's to close that loophole that existed. You know, it's estimated that 50 women are shot and killed by an intimate partner every month in America50 a month. Let's pass it and save some lives.
And I need not tell anyone this, but gun violence is becoming an epidemic in America. The flag at the White House was still flying at half-mast for the 8 victims in the mass shooting in Georgia when 10 more lives were taken in a mass shooting in Colorado. And, in the week in between those two events, 250 other Americans were shot dead in the streets of America250 shot dead.
I know how hard it is to make progress on this issue. In the nineties, we passed universal background checks, a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines that hold 100 rounds that can be fired off in seconds. We beat the NRA. Mass shootings and gun violence declined. Check out the report over 10 years. But in the early twenty2000s, the law expired, and we've seen daily bloodshed since. I'm not saying if the law continued, we wouldn't see bloodshed.
More than 2 weeks ago in the Rose Garden, surrounded by some of the bravest people I knowthe survivors and families who lost loved ones to gun violenceI laid out several of the Department of Justice actions that are being taken to impact on this epidemic.
One of them is banning so-called ""ghost guns."" These are homemade guns built from a kit that includes directions on how to finish the firearm. The parts have no serial numbers, so they show up at crime scenes, and they can't be traced. The buyers of these ghost gun kits aren't required to pass any background check. Anyone, from a criminal or terrorist, could buy this kit and, within 30 minutes, have a weapon that's lethal. But no more.
And I will do everything in my power to protect the American people from this epidemic of gun violence, but it's time for Congress to act as well. Look, I don't want to become confrontational, but we need more Senate Republicans to join the overwhelming majority of Democratic colleagues and close the loopholes requiring a background check on purchases of guns. We need a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. And don't tell me it can't be done. We did it before, and it worked.
Talk to most responsible gun owners and hunters. They'll tell you there's no possible justification for having 100 rounds in a weapon. What do you think: deer are wearing Kevlar vests? [Laughter] No, what'sthey'll tell you that there are too many people today who are able to buy a gun, but shouldn't be able to buy a gun.
These kinds of reasonable reforms have overwhelming support from the American people, including many gun owners. The country supports reform and isand Congress should act.
This shouldn't be a red or blue issue. And no amendment to the Constitution is absolute. You can't yell ""Fire!"" in a crowded theater. From the very beginning, there were certain guns, weapons, that could not be owned by Americans. Certain people could not own those weapons ever. We're not changing the Constitution; we're being reasonable. I think this is not a Democrat or Republican issue, I think it's an American issue.
And here's what else we can do: Immigration has always been essential to America. Let's end our exhausting war over immigration. For more than 30 years, politicians have talked about immigration reform, and we've done nothing about it. It's time to fix it.
On day one of my Presidency, I kept my commitment and sent a comprehensive immigration bill to the United States Congress. If you believe we need to secure the border, pass it, because it has a lot of money for high-tech border security. If you believe in a pathway to citizenship, pass it so over 11 million undocumented folksthe vast majority are here overstaying visas. Pass it. We can actuallyif you actually want to solve a problem, I've sent a bill toso take a close look at it.
We have toalso have to get at the root problem of why people are fleeing, particularly toto our southern border from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador: the violence, the corruption, the gangs, and the political instability, hunger, hurricanes, earthquakes, natural disasters.
When I was President, my Presidentwhen I was Vice President, the President asked me to focus on providing the help needed to address the root causes of migration. And it helped keep people in their own countries instead of being forced to leave. The plan was working, but the last administration decided it was not worth it. I'm restoring the program and asked Vice President Harris to lead our diplomatic effort to take care of this. I have absolute confidence she'll get the job done.
Now, look, if you don't like my plan, let's at least pass what we all agree on. Congress needs to pass legislation this year to finally secure protection for ""dreamers,"" the young people who have only known America as their home. And permanent protection for immigrants who are here on temporary protected status who came from countries beset by manmade and natural-madeviolence and disaster. As well as a pathway to citizenship for farmworkers who put food on our tables.
Look, immigrants have done so much for America during this pandemic and throughout our history. The country supports immigration reform. We should act. Let's argue over it, let's debate it, but let's act.
And if we truly want to restore the soul of America, we need to protect the sacred right to vote. Most peoplemore people voted in the last Presidential election than any time in American history, in the middle of the worst pandemic ever. It should be celebrated. Instead, it's being attacked. Congress should pass H.R. 1 and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and send it to my desk right away. The country supports it. The Congress should act now.
Look, in closing, as we gather here tonight, the images of a violent mob assaulting this Capitol, desecrating our democracy, remain vivid in all our minds. Lives were put at riskmany of your lives. Lives were lost. Extraordinary courage was summoned. The insurrection was an existential crisis, a test of whether our democracy could survive. And it did.
But the struggle is far from over. The question of whether our democracy will long endure is both ancient and urgent, as old as our Republic, still vital today. Can our democracy deliver on its promise that all of us, created equal in the image of God, have a chance to lead lives of dignity, respect, and possibility? Can our democracy deliver the mostto the most pressing needs of our people? Can our democracy overcome the lies, anger, hate, and fears that have pulled us apart?
America's adversariesthe autocrats of the worldare betting we can't. And I promise you, they're betting we can't. They believe we're too full of anger and division and rage. They look at the images of the mob that assaulted the Capitol as proof that the sun is setting on American democracy. But they are wrong. You know it; I know it. But we have to prove them wrong.
We have to prove democracy still works, that our Government still works and we can deliver for our people. In our first hundred days together, we've acted to restore the people's faith in democracy to deliver. We're vaccinating the Nation. We're creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs. We're delivering real results to people; they can see it and feel it in their own lives.
Opening doors of opportunity, guaranteeing some more fairness and justice, that's the essence of America. That's democracy in action. Our Constitution opens with the wordsas trite as it sounds""We the People"". Well, it's time to remember that ""We the People"" are the Governmentyou and I. Not some force in a distant capital. Not some powerful force that we have no control over. It's us. It's ""We the People.""
In another era when our democracy was tested, Franklin Roosevelt reminded us, ""In America, we do our part."" We all do our part. That's all I'm asking: that we do our part, all of us. If we do that, we will meet the center challenge of the age by proving that democracy is durable and strong. Autocrats will not win the future. We will. America will. And the future belongs to America.
As I stand here tonight before you, in a new and vital hour of life and democracy of our Nation, and I can say with absolute confidence: I have never been more confident or optimistic about America, not because I'm President, because what's happening with the American people.
We have stared into the abyss of insurrection and autocracy, pandemic and pain, and ""We the People"" did not flinch. At the very moment our adversaries were certain we would pull apart and fail, we came together. We united. With light and hope, we summoned a new strength, new resolve to position us to win the competition of the 21st century, on our way to a union more perfect, more prosperous, and more just, as one people, one Nation, and one America.
Folks, as I told every world leader I've ever met with over the years, it's never ever, ever been a good bet to bet against America, and it still isn't.
We are the United States of America. There is not a single thingnothingnothing beyond our capacity. We can do whatever we set our mind to do if we do it together. So let's begin to get together.
God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you for your patience.

"
2021-04-27 00:00:00,Remarks on the COVID-19 Response and National Vaccination Efforts and an Exchange With Reporters,"
The President. Good afternoonthis beautiful afternoon.
Next week, I'll be laying out the path ahead to continue our fight against COVID-19 to get us to July 4. This is our target date to get life in America closer to normal and to begin to celebrate our independence from the virus together with our friends and loved ones as weto celebrate Independence Day.
But before that, I wanted to speak briefly to all of you today about the recent change announced by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC.
Let me say first: While we still have a long way to go in this fight and a lot of work to do in May and June to get us to July 4, we've made stunning progress because of all of you, the American people. Cases and deaths are down, down dramatically from where they were when I took office on January 20, and continuing to fall.
That is particularly true for a group of Americans that we were most worried about when it came to this virus: senior citizens. When I took office in January, we were losing literally tens of thousands of our seniors each week: grandparents who were loved so dearly, moms and dads, pillars of every community, gone by the thousands every day. At that time, less than 1 percent of seniors were fully vaccinated when I took office.
Today, in less than 100 days, more than 67 percenttwo-thirds of our seniorsare now fully vaccinated, and more than 80 percent of seniors have had at least one shot. That effort has resulted in a drop of 80 percent in deaths among American seniors, a 70-percent drop in hospitalizations. So instead of losing thousands of seniors each day, we're saving thousands of lives, and more and more as each day goes by.
And by the way, based on reported data, the proportionthe proportion of seniorswho have been vaccinated is essentially equal between White and seniors of color. I said from the beginning that we werewe're going to fight this virus with equity, equity for all. As a matter of a fact, if I'm not mistaken, there are more Latinos and African American seniors that have been vaccinated, as a percentage, than White seniors. These numbers are a sign of progress on that front as well.
Now, last week, I announced that we had crossed the threshold of 200 million shots. We've nowsince Inauguration Day, we have given 215 million shots. And thatanyone 16 years of age or older is now eligible to get the vaccine: now, today, immediately.
And because of the extraordinary progress we've made in fighting this virus and the progress our scientists have made in learning about how it gets transmitted, earlier today the CDC made an important announcement: Starting today, if you're fully vaccinated and you're outdoors, you needand not in a big crowdyou no longer need to wear a mask.
I want to be absolutely clear: If you're in a crowd, like a stadium or at a conference or a concert, you still need to wear a mask even if you're outside. But beginning today, gathering with a group of friends in a park, going for a picnicas long as you are vaccinated and outdoorsyou can do it without a mask. The CDC is able to make this announcement because our scientists are convinced by the data that the odds of getting or giving the virus to others is very, very low if you'reboth been fully vaccinated and out the open air.
The CDC also have clarified which outdoor activities are safer or less safe, depending on whether you've been vaccinated. The bottom line is clear: If you're vaccinated, you can do more things, more safely, both outdoors as well as indoors. Forso for those who haven't gotten their vaccination yet, especially if you're younger or thinking you don't need it, this is another great reason to go get vaccinated nownow.
Yes, the vaccines are about saving your life, but also the lives of the people around you. But they're also about helping youus get back to closer to normal in our livingmore normal living: getting together with friends, going to the park for a picnic without needing to mask up. We're back to that place now as long as you get vaccinated.
So go get this shot. It's never been easier. And once you're fully vaccinated, you can go without a mask when you're outside and away from big crowds.
I want to thank the team at the CDC for everything they're doing to help us lead with science and bring our communities out of this crisis safely and responsibly. And I also want to thank everyone who has gotten the vaccine for doing your patriotic duty and helping us get toon the path to Independence Day, which I'll be discussing more in detail next week.
In the meantime, I urge all Americans: Don't let up now. Keep following the guidance. Go get your vaccination now. It's free, and it's convenient. Ninety percent of the American people live within 5 miles of a site where you can get a vaccination. You can do this, and we will do this.
Thank you all. And God bless you. And as much as the temptation is to stay outdoors on this beautiful day, I've got more work to do.
Thank you all very, very much. Bye-bye.
Q. Mr. President, if the risk is so low outdoors, why doesn't it apply to everybody?
Q. Mr. President, would you have any preconditions for a meeting with Vladimir Putinwait, would you have any preconditions before meeting with Vladimir Putin?
The President. Ione at a time.
Coronavirus Prevention Efforts 
Q. If the risk is so low outdoors, why doesn't this new guidance apply to everybody?
The President. Because the science indicates that this is the most certain way to make sure it doesn't spread: if both people have been vaccinatedthe people you're withand you're outside.
Q. And you chose to wear a mask. Sir, you chose to wear a mask.
Q. Do you have any preconditions before meeting with Vladimir
Q. You chose to wear a mask as you walked out here. What message were you sending by wearing a mask outside alone?
The President. By watching me take it off and not put it back on until I get inside.
President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin of Russia 
Q. Do you have any preconditions before meeting with Vladimir Putin?
The President. I'll discuss that all another day. Thank you.
Q. What have you asked Vice President Harris to do?
U.S. Vaccine and Component Material Support for India/Coronavirus Treatment Assistance 
Q. Sir, IndiaIndia needs medicine. India needs AstraZeneca. Sir, will you make it faster to getfor them to get the vaccinethe vaccines we will get soon?
The President. You said India?
Q. India. They're suffering at this moment.
Q. What do you say to the folks in India?
Q. Will you make it
The President. Look, I'm sorry. I'm going tothis is the last question I'll take, and I've hadI'm really going to be in trouble.
With regard to India, I spoke at length with Modi, the Prime Minister. We are sending immediately a whole series of help that he needs, including providing for thoseremdesivir and other drugs that are able to deal with this and prevent, in some cases, but recoverhelp recovery.
Secondly, we are sending the actual mechanical parts that are needed for the machinery they have to build a vaccine. And that's being done as well.
We're also discussingI've discussed with him when we'll be able to send actual vaccines to India, which would be my intention to do. The problem is, right now, we have to make sure we have other vaccines, like Novavax and others, coming on, probably. And I think we'll be in a position to be able to shareto sharevaccines, as well as know-how, with other countries who are in real need.
That's the hope and expectation.
And I might add, when we were in a bind at the very beginning, India helped us.
Thank you.
Q. Sir, what have you asked the Vice President to do to help with vaccine skepticism?
Q. How will you decide which countries?
Q. How do you convince those still

2021-04-23 00:00:00,Remarks at the Virtual Leaders Summit on Climate Session on the Economic Opportunities of Climate Action,"
Well, welcome back. And thank you all againall the world leaders who have joined usthank you for joining. And, John, thank you for putting this together.
We've made great progress, in my view, so far. And I'm grateful to all the leaders who have announced new commitments to help us meet the existential threat of climate change. This summit is a start, a start of a road that will take us to Glasgow for the U.N. Climate Change Conference in November where we're going to make these commitments real, putting all of our nations on a path to a secure, prosperous, and sustainable future.
Today's final session is not about the threat of climate change poses; it's about the opportunity that addressing climate change provides. It's an opportunity to create millions of good-paying jobs around the world and innovatein innovative sectorsyou know, jobs that bring greater quality of life, greater dignity to the people performing those jobs in every nation.
For a line worker, electricians, utility workers: laying transmission lines, connecting battery storage, and making our electric grid more modern. For automotive workers: building electric cars, trucks, and buses. Skilled workers installing and chargecharging stations to accommodate them throughout our countries.
Construction workers, engineers, insulators: upgrading our schools and commercial buildings and constructing new energy-efficient homes. Manufacturing: manufacturing workers building nuclear and carbon capture technologies, solar panels, and wind turbines. And people working in the fields that we haven't even conceived of yeton farms and on factories and in laboratories and universities with things we haven't even thought of so far.
This isthis challenge and these opportunities are going to be met by working people in every nation. And as we transition to a clean energy future, we must ensure that workers who have thrived in yesterday's and today's industries have as bright a tomorrow in the new industries as well as in the places where they live, in the communities they have built.
When we invest in climate resilience and infrastructure, we create opportunities for everyone. That's at the heart of my Jobs Plan that I proposed here in United States. It's how our Nation intends to build an economy that gives everybody a fair shot.
As you heard in the last session, it requires investing in innovation. That's why I've asked the Secretary of Energymy Energy Secretary, Jennifer Granholm, who you saw earlierto speed the development of critical technologies to tackle the climate crisis.
No single technology is the answer on its own, because every sector requires innovation to meet this moment. You know, this critical effort is going to propel the most impactful breakthroughs at home and around the world and lower the cost ofwe're paying now for polluting the air so badly. We're going to move to net zero in a transition in all countries.
Now, look, every country will need to invest in new clean-energy technologies as we work forward andto deal with net-zero emissions.
I am also very proud to announce the United States is again becoming a key leader in Mission Innovationwe helped launch the program during the Obama-Biden administrationa pact between the world's largest economies to ramp up investments in clean-energy research and development.
And today, America is once again stepping into the leadership role. We will be joining and a partnerfor the nations and efforts to decarbonize critical sectors across the board, including industrial sector, where we'll join with Sweden and India, and leadershipin the Leadership Group for Industry Transition; the power sector, where we'll work alongside of the United Kingdom to spread progress and speed it up toward a carbon-free power system both here and around the world; and in agriculturethe agricultural sector, where we'll launch the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate with the United Arab Emirates and other partners.
We alsoI'm very heartened by President Putin's call yesterday for the world to collaborate and advance carbon dioxide removal. And the United States looks forward to working with Russia and other countries in that endeavor. It has a great promise.
This is a moment for all of us to build better economies for our children, our grandchildren, and all of us to thrive inand not just now, but beyond for the next generations.
Nations that work together to invest in a cleaner economy will reap rewards for their citizens. The United States is committedwe are committedto making those investments to grow our economy here at home while connecting with markets around the world.
For example, we're launching a new Global Partnership for Climate-Smart Infrastructure. This will create good-paying jobs here in America by supporting development of new clean infrastructure in our partner countries.
These are the sort of partnerships that are going to be good for all of us. And I think they'll have additional benefits just with us working together.
And today I'm excited to welcome my counterparts in Spain, Nigeria, Vietnam, and Poland to share their thinking on how to realize the economiesthe economic opportunities of the climate response.
And we're going to be joined by labor, and business, community leaders from around the world to talk about what's happening in their communities around climate-related jobs.
And I'm pleased to be joined by Secretary Buttigieg, Ambassador Tai, and National Climate Adviser Gina McCarthy, the Chair of my National Climate Task Force.
I look forward to our conversation and making more progress throughout today. Thank you.
[At this point, the President participated in a virtual roundtable discussion, and no transcript was provided. He then made closing remarks as follows.]
Well, John, thank you. As we close this historic summit, I want to take a moment to thank the world leaders and all the participants from around the globe who have joined together to confront the existential threat of climate change. There's no threat like it.
Over the last 2 days, I think we made some important progress. In the spirit of increasing efforts to address climate change globally, we're launching an initiative to help developing countries strengthen their climate efforts while achieving their development goals. And that's going to mean money.
Yesterday I announced the United States made a new commitment, under the Paris Agreement, to cut our emissions by 50 to 52 percent by the end of this decade. And we'll get there by investing in American workers, American jobs, American infrastructure, and building a stronger and more resilient economy.
We also welcome ambitious targets announced this week by two great partners. My good friend, the Prime Minister of Japan, Prime Minister Suga, announced that Japan will cut emissions by up to 60excuse me50 percent below the 2013 levels, almost doubling their current target. Prime Minister Trudeau, another good friend, from Canada, will reduce emissions by as much as 45 percent below the 2005 levels.
These announcements came on top of a demonstrated leadership and strong existing targets set by the European Union and the United Kingdom. And together, these commitments mean that half of the world's economy is now committed to pace the action that we need toat a pace we need to limit warming to 1.5 degrees, an amount beyond which scientists tell uswe have said a thousand timesall of us could be at a point of no return.
We also heard encouraging newsannouncements from Argentina, Brazil, South Africa, and South Korea. And I'm looking forward to working with India's Prime Minister Modi in a new partnership to achieve our climate and energy goals, making this a core pillar of our bilateral cooperation.
And the commitments we've made must become real. Commitment without us doing it, it's just a lot of hot air. No pun intended. You know, we must implement these commitments, accelerate them, and innovate and invest in order to reach them. And we need to work together, once again, to build a clean energy future that delivers good jobs and overcomes the threat of climate change, investing in innovation and in our people, raising our ambitions, ensuring every nation does its part.
And we'll meet again in Glasgow in November for the U.N. Climate Conference. I believe we're going to meet those moments. I think we're going to meet the moment that we've all been talking about to make this commitment and to keep the commitment. It's an economic imperative. I think it's a moral imperative to future generations.
Here in America, there's never been a challenge we couldn't meet if we put our minds to it and did it together. I hope your countries feel the same way. I know we can do this. I know we can do this.
Thank you for your commitment, thank you for joining the summit, and thank you for stepping up to confront this crisis before it's too late. I know we can seize the opportunities of a cleaner, stronger, and more resilient economy and deliver the benefits to people in each of our nations.
So I look forward to working alongside you to confront the climate crisis, to build a better world for all of our children and grandchildren. We're going to do this together.
Thank you all. And may God bless you. And let's get to work. Thanks again.

2021-04-22 00:00:00,Remarks at the Virtual Leaders Summit on Climate Session on Investing in Climate Solutions,"
Well, hello again, everyone. Welcome back. As I mentioned this morning, meeting the moment on climate change must begin with a recognition that every nation has a responsibility and every nation is at risk. Hurricanes and wildfires don't confine themselves to national borders. Instability and displacement in one country has ripple effects that are felt throughout the regions and across the world.
Taking on climate change together is more than just the right thing to do; it's also in everyone's best interests to do it. Meeting this challenge is going to require mobilizing financing at an unprecedented scale.
The private sector is already recognizing this. They know that climate change is more than a threat. It also presents the largest job creation opportunities in history. Hundreds of billions of dollars are already being invested worldwide every year, supporting projects to help build a resilient economies with net-zero emission goals.
But the private sector has more it can do and must do. Let's be clear: Even then, the private sector can't meet these challenges alone. Governments need to step up, and they need to lead. We have a role to play in making sure that material climate risks to financial systems are measured, disclosed, and mitigated. If Wall Street is pumping billions of dollars into businesses that could be turned upside down when the next storm comesand we know there will be more stormsWall Street needs to make clear the risk it's taking on.
Those dollarsthose dollars being investedare often the hard-earned savings of our workers: pensions. We can't take steps to protect our workers if we don't step up. We have to be able to move forward from the downside deal, then into the upside, and strengthen the resilience of our financial system. I have directed my team to develop an approach to do exactly that.
You know, and our nations mustall of our nations must stand together in shifting policies and on public investment as well, you know, to invest in breakthrough technologies; to finally end fossil fuel subsidies; to help the world's most vulnerable nations and those bearing the least responsibility for the climate crisis cope with the devastating impacts of the climate crisis; you know, to help developing economies leapfrog to a clean technologies of tomorrow; to mobilize the trillions of dollars needed to make the most of the opportunity to build a clean-energy, job-rich path to meet our goals; to make sure that our climate response is about more than just building and developing new sectors, but also about international security, regional stability, food security, and gender and racial equality as well.
You know, our shared goal of mobilizing $100 billion per year in developing countries is critical for achieving that. It's an investment that's going to pay significant dividends for all of us. And to help meet that goal, the United States will double its 2024by 2024, our annual public climate financing development to developing countries. Compare that to what we were providing during the second half of the Obama-Biden administration.
At the same time, we intend to triple our public financing for climate application in developing countries by 2024, recognizing the dividends that pays in reducing costs of disasters and conflicts are avoided. You know, our Development Finance Corporation is committing to net-zero emissions through its investment portfolio by 2040 and to increase climate-focused investments to 33 percent of all new investments beginning in 2023, the earliest of any country.
In addition, today we are issuing America's first-ever International Climate Finance Plan. This plan represents our vision for financing the global climate response in a coordinated way. It lays out specific steps that Federal agencies of the United States will take to increase both the quality and quantity of climate financing. And it will help us spur the private sector to contribute more to climate solutions in developing nations and here at home as well.
You know, this moment demands urgency. Good ideas and good intentions aren't good enough. We need to ensure that the financing will be there, both public and private, to meet the moment on climate change and to help us seize the opportunity for good jobs, strong economies, and a more secure world.
I'm confidentI'm confidentthat we are going to get this done together. And I look forward to the progress we're going to make together in today's sessions.
So let's move on.

"
2021-03-11 00:00:00,Address to the Nation on the First Anniversary of the COVID-19 Pandemic,"
The President. Good evening, my fellow Americans.
Tonight I'd like to talk to you about where we are as we mark 1 year since everything stopped because of this pandemic. A year ago, we were hit with a virus that was met with silence and spread unchecked. Denials for days, weeks, then months that led to more deaths, more infections, more stress, and more loneliness.
Photos and videos from 2019 feel like they were taken in another era. The last vacation. The last birthday with friends. The last holiday with the extended family. While it was different for everyone, we all lost something. A collective suffering. A collective sacrifice. A year filled with the loss of life and the loss of living for all of us.
But, in the loss, we saw how much there was to gain in appreciation, respect, and gratitude. Finding light in the darkness is a very American thing to do. In fact, it may be the most American thing we do. And that's what we've done.
We've seen frontline and essential workers risking their livessometimes losing themto save and help others. Researchers and scientists racing for a vaccine. And so many of you, as Hemingway wrote, being strong in all the broken places. I know it's been hard. I truly know.
As I've told you before, I carry a card in my pocket with the number of Americans who have died from COVID to date. It's on the back of my schedule. As of now, total deaths in America: 527,726. That's more deaths than in World War I, World War II, the Vietnam war, and 9/11 combined. They were husbands, wives, sons and daughters, grandparents, friends, neighborsyoung and old. They leave behind loved ones unable to truly grieve or to heal, even to have a funeral.
But I'm also thinking about everyone else who lost this past year to natural causes, by cruel fate of accident or other disease. They, too, died alone. They, too, leave behind loved ones who are hurting badly.
You know, you've often heard me say before, I talk about the longest walk any parent can make is up a short flight of stairs to his child's bedroom to say: ""I'm sorry, but I lost my job. Can't be here anymore."" Like my dad told me when he lost his job in Scranton.
So many of you have had to make that same walk this past year. You lost your job. You closed your business. Facing eviction, homelessness, hunger, a loss of control, and maybe worst of all, a loss of hope.
Watching a generation of children who may be set back up to a year or morebecause they've not been in schoolbecause of their loss of learning.
It's the details of life that matter most, and we've missed those details, the big details and small moments: weddings, birthdays, graduationsall the things that needed to happen, but didn't. The first date. The family reunions. The Sunday night rituals. It's all has exacted a terrible cost on the psyche of so many of us. For we are fundamentally a people who want to be with others: to talk, to laugh, to hug, to hold one another.
But this virus has kept us apart. Grandparents haven't seen their children or grandchildren. Parents haven't seen their kids. Kids haven't seen their friends. The things we used to do that always filled us with joy have become the things we couldn't do and broke our hearts. Too often, we've turned against one another. A maskthe easiest thing to do to save livessometimes, it divides us. States pitted against one other instead of working with each other.
Vicious hate crimes against Asian Americans, who have been attacked, harassed, blamed, and scapegoated. At this very moment, so many of themour fellow Americansthey're on the frontlines of this pandemic, trying to save lives, and stillstillthey are forced to live in fear for their lives just walking down streets in America. It's wrong, it's un-American, and it must stop.
Look, we know what we need to do to beat this virus: Tell the truth. Follow the scientists and the science. Work together. Put trust and faith in our Government to fulfill its most important function, which is protecting the American peopleno function more important.
We need to remember, the Government isn't some foreign force in a distant Capital. No, it's us. All of us. ""We the People."" For you and I, that America thrives when we give our hearts, when we turn our hands to common purpose. And right now, my friends, we are doing just that. And I have to say, as your President, I am grateful to you.
Last summer, I was in Philadelphia, and I met a small-business ownera woman. I asked herI said, ""What do you need most?"" I'll never forget what she said to me. She saidlooking me in the eye, she said: ""I just want the truth. The truth. Just tell me the truth."" Think of that. My fellow Americans, you're owed nothing less than the truth.
And for all of you asking when things will get back to normal, here is the truth: The only way to get our lives back, to get our economy back on track is to beat the virus. You've been hearing me say that forwhile I was running and the last 50 days I've been President. But this is one of the most complex operations we've ever undertaken as a nation in a long time.
That's why I'm using every power I have as President of the United States to put us on a war footing to get the job done. It sounds like hyperbole, but I mean it: a war footing. And thank God we're making some real progress now.
In my first full day in office, I outlined for you a comprehensive strategy to beat this pandemic. And we've spent every day since attempting to carry it out. Two months ago, the countrythis country didn't have nearly enough vaccine supply to vaccinate all or anywhere near all of the American public. But soon we will.
We've been working with the vaccine manufacturersPfizer, Moderna, Johnson and Johnsonto manufacture and purchase hundreds of millions of doses of these three safe, effective vaccines. And now, at the direction and with the assistance of my administration, Johnson and Johnson is working together with a competitor, Merck, to speed up and increase the capacity to manufacture new Johnson and Johnson vaccine, which is one shot.
In fact, just yesterday I announcedand I met with the CEOs of both companiesI announced our plan to buy an additional 100 million doses of Johnson and Johnson vaccines. These two companiescompetitorshave come together for the good of the Nation, and they should be applauded for it.
It's truly a national effort, just like we saw during World War II. Now, because of all the work we've done, we'll have enough vaccine supply for all adults in America by the end of May. That's months ahead of schedule. And we're mobilizing thousands of vaccinators to put the vaccine in one's arm. Calling on Active Duty military, FEMA, retired doctors and nurses, administrators, and those to administer the shots.
And we've been creating more places to get the shots. We've made it possible for you to get a vaccine at nearly oneany one of nearly 10,000 pharmacies across the country, just like you get your flu shot. And we're also working with Governors and mayors, in red States and blue States, to set up and support nearly 600 federally supported vaccination centers that administers hundreds of thousands of shots per day. You can drive up to a stadium or a large parking lot, get your shot, never leave your car, and drive home in less than an hour.
We've been sending vaccines to hundreds of community health centers all across America, located in underserved areas. And we've been deployingand we will deploy moremobile vehicles and pop-up clinics to meet you where you live so those who are least able to get the vaccine are able to get it.
We continue to work on making at-home testing available. And we've been focused on serving people in the hardest hit communities of this pandemic: Black, Latino, Native American, and rural communities.
So what does all this add up to? When I took office 50 days ago, only 8 percent of Americans after monthsonly 8 percent of those over the age of 65 have gotten their first vaccination. Today, that number is [nearly]* 65 percent. Just 14 percent of Americans over the age 75, 50 days ago, had gotten their first shot. Today, that number is well over 70 percent.
With new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Preventionthe CDCthat came out on Monday, it means simply this: Millions and millions of grandparents who went months without being able to hug their grandkids can now do so. And the more people who are fully vaccinated, the CD [CDC]* will continue to provide guidance on what you can do in the workplace, places of worship, with your friends, and as well as travel.
When I came into office, you may recall, I set a goal that many of you said was, kind of, way over the top. I said I intended to get a hundred million shots in people's arms in my first hundred days in office. Tonight I can say we are not only going to meet that goal, we're going to beat that goal. Because we're actually on track to reach this goal of a hundred million shots in arms on my 60th day in office. No other country in the world has done this. None.
Now I want to talk about the next steps we're thinking about. First, tonight I'm announcing that I will direct all States, Tribes, and Territories to make all adultspeople 18 and overeligible to be vaccinated no later than May 1. Let me say that again: All adult Americans will be eligible to get a vaccine no later than May 1. That's much earlier than expected.
Let me be clear: That doesn't mean everyone's going to have that shot immediately, but it means you'll be able to get in line beginning May 1. Every adult will be eligible to get their shot.
And, to do this, we're going to go from a million shots a day that I promised in December, before I was sworn in, to maintainingbeating our current pace of 2 million shots a day, outpacing the rest of the world.
Secondly, at the time when every adult is eligible in May, we will launch, with our partners, new tools to make it easier for you to find the vaccine and where to get the shot, including a new website that will help you first find the place to get vaccinated and the one nearest you. No more searching day and night for an appointment for you and your loved ones.
Thirdly, with the passage of the American Rescue Planand I thank again the House and Senate for passing itand my announcement last month of a plan to vaccinate teachers and school staff, including bus drivers, we can accelerate the massive, nationwide effort to reopen our schools safely and meet my goal, that I stated at the same time about a hundred million shots, of opening the majority of K-through-8 schools in my first hundred days in office. This is going to be the number-one priority of my new Secretary of Education, Miguel Cardona.
Fourth, in the coming weeks, we will issue further guidance on what you can and cannot do once fully vaccinated, to lessen the confusion, to keep people safe, and encourage more people to get vaccinated.
And finally, fifth, and maybe most importantly: I promise I will do everything in my power, I will not relent until we beat this virus, but I need you, the American people. I need you. I need every American to do their part. And that's not hyperbole. I need you.
I need you to get vaccinated when it's your turn and when you can find an opportunity and to help your family and friends and neighbors get vaccinated as well.
Because here's the point: If we do all this, if we do our part, if we do this together, by July the 4th, there's a good chance you, your families, and friends will be able to get together in your backyard or in your neighborhood and have a cookout and a barbeque and celebrate Independence Day. That doesn't mean large events with lots of people together, but it does mean small groups will be able to get together.
After this long hard year, that will make this Independence Day something truly special, where we not only mark our independence as a nation, but we begin to mark our independence from this virus.
But to get there, we can't let our guard down. This fight is far from orderfrom over. As I told the woman in Pennsylvania, ""I will tell you the truth."" A July 4 with your loved ones is the goal. But a goala lot can happen; conditions can change.
The scientists have made clear that things may get worse again as new variants of the virus spread. And we've got work to do to ensure everyone has confidence in the safety and effectiveness of all three vaccines.
So my message to you is this: Listen to Dr. Fauci, one of the most distinguished and trusted voices in the world. He's assured us the vaccines are safe. They underwent rigorous scientific review. I know they're safe. Vice President Harris and I know they're safe. That's why we got the vaccine publicly in front of cameras sofor the world to see, so you could see us do it. The First Lady and the Second Gentleman also got vaccinated.
Talk to your family, your friends, your neighborsthe people you know best who've gotten the vaccine. We need everyone to get vaccinated. We need everyone to keep washing their hands, stay socially distanced, and keep wearing the masks as recommended by the CDC.
Because even if we devote every resource we have, beating this virus and getting back to normal depends on national unity. And national unity isn't just how politics and politicians vote in Washington or what the loudest voices say on cable or online. Unity is what we do together as fellow Americans. Because if we don't stay vigilant and the conditions change, then we may have to reinstate restrictions to get back on track. And, please, we don't want to do again.
We've made so much progress. This is not the time to let up. Just as we are emerging from a dark winter into a hopeful spring and summer is not the time to not stick with the rules.
I'll close with this. We've lost so much over the last year. We've lost family and friends. We've lost businesses and dreams we spent years building. We've lost time, time with each other.
And our children have lost so much time with their friends, time with their schools. No graduation ceremonies this spring. No graduations from college, high school, moving-up ceremonies. You know, and there's something else we lost. We lost faith in whether our Government and our democracy can deliver on really hard things for the American people.
But as I stand here tonight, we're proving once again something I have said time and time again until they're probably tired of hearing me say it. I say it foreign leaders and domestic alike: It's never, ever a good bet to bet against the American people. America is coming back.
The development, manufacture, and distribution of the vaccines in record time is a true miracle of science. It is one of the most extraordinary achievements any country has ever accomplished. And we also just saw the Perseverance rover land on Mars. Stunning images of our dreams that are now a reality. Another example of the extraordinary American ingenuity, commitment, and belief in science and one another.
And today I signed into law the American Rescue Plan, an historic piece of legislation that delivers immediate relief to millions of people. It includes $1,400 in direct rescue checkspayments. That means a typical family of four earning about $110,000 will get checks for $5,600 deposited if they have direct deposit or in a checka Treasury check.
It extends unemployment benefits. It helps small businesses. It lowers health care premiums for many. It provides food and nutrition, keeps families in their homes. And it will cut child poverty in this country in half, according to the experts. And it funds all the steps I've just described to beat the virus and create millions of jobs.
In the coming weeks and months, I'll be traveling, along with the First Lady, the Vice President, the Second Gentleman, and members of my Cabinet, to speak directly to you, to tell you the truth about how the American Rescue Plan meets the moment. And if it fails at any place, I will acknowledge that it failed. But it will not.
About how after a long, dark years1 whole yearthere is hope and light of better days ahead. If we all do our part, this country will be vaccinated soon, our economy will be on the mend, our kids will be back in school, and we'll have proven once again that this country can do anythinghard things, big things, important things.
Over a year ago, no one could have imagined what we were about to go through, but now we're coming through it, and it's a shared experience that binds us together as a Nation. We are bound together by the loss and the pain of the days that have gone by. But we're also bound together by the hope and the possibilities of the days in front of us.
My fervent prayer for our country is that, after all we have been through, we'll come together as one people, one Nation, one America. I believe we can, and we will. We're seizing this moment. And history, I believe, will record: We faced and overcame one of the toughest and darkest periods in this Nation's history, darkest we've ever known.
I promise you, we'll come out stronger, with a renewed faith in ourselves, a renewed commitment to one another, to our communities, and to our country. This is the United States of America, and there is nothingnothingfrom the bottom of my heart, I believe thisthere is nothing we can't do when we do it together.
So God bless you all. And please, God, give solace to all those people who lost someone. And may God protect our troops.
Thank you for taking the time to listen. I look forward to seeing you.

2021-03-11 00:00:00,Remarks on Signing the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021,"
Thank you for coming in. In the weeks that this bill has been discussed and debated, it's clear that an overwhelming percentage of the American peopleDemocrats, Independents, our Republican friendshave made it clearthe people out there made it clear they strongly support the American Rescue Plan.
Yesterday, with the final passage of the plan in the House of Representatives, their voices were heard and reflected in everything we have in this bill. And I believe this isand most people, I think, do as wellthis historic legislation is about rebuilding the backbone of this country and giving people in this Nationworking people and middle class folks, the people who built the countrya fighting chance. That's what the essence of it is.
And I'm going to have a lot more to say about that tonight and in the next couple of days, and be able to take your questions. But in the meantime, what I'm going to do is sign this bill and make the presentation tonight. And then, there's going to be plenty of opportunities where we're going to be on the road, not only talking aboutwhat I'm talking about tonight is the impact on the virus and how we're going to end this pandemic.

2021-03-10 00:00:00,Remarks Announcing a Collaboration Agreement by Johnson and Johnson and Merck and Company on COVID-19 Vaccine Production and an Exchange With Reporters,"
The President. I want to thank you both for those words. You know, you and I knew one another when I wasn't a President and you weren't a chairman.
Merck and Co., Inc., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Kenneth C. Frazier. Right. [Laughter]
The President. We'd ride back and forth on Amtrak. You lived in Philadelphia; I was commuting to Wilmington. It's good to see you both here. And thank both of you for your kind words.
And I want to thank the scientists and researchers at Johnson and Johnson for the literal heroic effort that began when COVID-19 first spread and led to the safe and effective vaccine that are now being coproduced.
Today we're seeing two health companiescompetitorseach with over 130 years of experience, coming together to help write a more hopeful chapter in our battle against COVID-19. I just had an opportunity to meet with both of these CEOs and with their senior operating officers and to hear about the work they're doing together to produce vaccine substitute [substance]* and accelerate what they call to take it to full finish [fill finish]*.
You know, what's clear is, this is a historic, nearly unprecedented collaboration. During World War II, one of the country's slogans was ""We are all in this together."" ""We are all in this together."" And companies took that slogan to heart. For example, one automaker didn't have the capacity to build enough jeeps; a competitor stepped in to help. Competing airline makers teamed up, and they produced parts for each other and gave the American pilots, as a consequence of that, control of the skies.
Today we're seeing the same type of collaboration when it comes to getting this virus under control. I said we ought to treat this like a war. So I want to thank the two companies for showing how we can come together to defeat this virus by putting patriotism and public health first. And I mean that literally, putting patriotism and public health first.
Your companies have been working closely with a man you've both privately, on the way over, bragged about: Jeff Zients. Jeff is in the front row here. I want to thank you, Jeff, and the entire COVID team you put together for the coordination of our COVID-19 response; and Dr. David Kessler and his team at the Department of Health and Human Services.
You know, when we came into office, we began working with the team at J&J to accelerate and add capacity to their manufacturing and production efforts. And it quickly became clear that Merckone of the world's leading vaccine manufacturerswas in a position to be the partner we needed in this effortin this wartime effort.
I've not hesitated to use my power under the Defense Production Act to expedite critical materials in vaccine production, such as equipment, machinery, and supplies. And it's not just Johnson and Johnson and Merck; Pfizer, Moderna also worked closely with us to help speed up the delivery of millions of more doses.
The result is that we're now on track to have enough vaccine supply for every American adult by the end of May, months earlier than anyone expected. And today I am directing Jeff and my HHS team to produce another 100 million doses and purchase another 100 million doses of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. I'm doing this because, in this wartime efforts, we need maximum flexibility. There is always a chance that we'll encounter unexpected challenges or we'llthere will be a new need for a vaccine effortor vaccination effort.
A lot can happen, a lot can change, and we need to be prepared. And of course, we need to match the miracle of science and the skill of manufacturing with the massive logistical undertaking of vaccinating over 300 million Americans. Already, we have gone from Johnson and Johnson vaccine authorization to shots in the arm in 3 days.
I was telling the gentlemen, we were at a facility yesterdaya veterans outreachand there were fouror there were three members of the veterans community getting shots. One was gettingof each of the three vaccines. And the guy in the middle, a veteran, was getting his. And I was standing about as far away as I am from you and standing up, and he was sitting down. And as the nurse put it in his arm, he went, ""J&J, just one."" [Laughter] Well, there's millions of people who are going to feel that way and be proud to havebe in a position that they havean ability to get the kind of help they need.
Seven weeks ago, only 8 percent of the seniorsthose most vulnerable to COVID-19had received the vaccination. Today, 60 percent of the people over the age of 65 or older have received at least one shot. And that's because this is the population that represents 80 percent of the COVID-19 deaths.
We've opened support and openedexcuse meand supported more than 500 community vaccination sites. That's moreand they're administrating hundreds of thousands of shots a day.
And for folks who aren't near a pharmacy or mass vaccination center, we're deploying mobile clinics, like vans, that go into places to meet the folks where they live. We're also supplying vaccines to community health centers to reach those who have been hit the hardest and suffered the most, especially Black, Latino, Native American, and rural communities. And this is important because we know we have more to do to ensure everyone is treated with equity and those most impacted get the care they deserve.
On Saturday, we hit a record of 2.9 million vaccinations in 1 day in America. And beyond the numbers are the stories: a father who says he no longer fears for his daughter when she leaves to go to work at the hospital; the children who are now able to hug their grandparents. The vaccines bring hope and healing in so many ways.
Again, a vaccinated American is the only way to beat the pandemic, get our economy back on track, and for us to get back our lives and our loved ones. You know, that's why the American Rescue Plan was so critical. I want to thank Speaker Pelosi and the House of Representatives today for passing the bill, and I will be signing it into law shortly. This bill represents a historica historicvictory for the American people. And I look forward to signing it later this week.
Everything in the American Rescue Plan addresses a real need, including investments to fund our entire vaccination effort: more vaccines, more vaccinators, and more vaccinations sites. Millions more Americans will get tested, including home testing. Schools will soon have the funding and resources to reopen safelya national imperative.
The American Rescue Plan, the partnership between Johnson and Johnson and Merck, proves we can do big things, important things in this country. Now, I'lllet me conclude with this: Tomorrow night I'm going on primetime to address the American people and talk about what we went through as a Nation this past year. But more importantly, I'm going to talk about what comes next. I'm going to launch the next phase of the COVID response and explain what we will do as a Government and what we will ask of the American people.
There is light at the end of this dark tunnel of the past year, but we cannot let our guard down now or assume that victory is inevitable. Together, we're going to get through this pandemic and usher in a healthier and more hopeful future. So there is real reason for hope, folks. There's real reason for hope, I promise you.
May God bless you all. May God protect our troops. And may God ease the pain in the heart of so many who have lost so many people in this pandemic.
Thank you, and I reallywe're going to do this. We're going to get it done. Thank you.
Q. Mr. President, what do you plan to do with the surplus? What will you do with the surplus?
National Supply of COVID-19 Vaccine Doses/International Cooperation Efforts 
Q. Mr. President, when will you do a press conference?
The President. The surplus willif we have a surplus, we're going to share it with the rest of the world. We've already decided we're going to work with the outfit COVAXwe've committed $4 billion to help get the funding for more vaccines around the world. This is not something that can be stopped by a fence, no matter how high you build a fence or a wall. So we're not going to be ultimately safe until the world is safe. And so we're going to start making sure Americans are taken care of first, but we're then going to try and help the rest of the world. Thank you.

2021-03-09 00:00:00,Remarks During a Tour of W.S. Jenks and Son,"
W.S. Jenks and Son co-owner Michael Siegel. So this is our main showroom in the store. You can see a lot of our employees up top there.
The President. Hey, everybody. How are you?
Participants. Hi!
The President. It's good to see you.
Mr. Siegel. We are DC's oldest hardware store. We've been continuously operating in this city since 1866. We've moved around a few times. We've been in this building for 7 years now. Like my father was telling you, this is actually our second Presidential visit, but our first one in this building. So welcome. We're excited to have you here today.
And we want to introduce you to Mary Ackley, from Little Wild Things. She has a separate business in our building. What they do is microgreens. And I'll turn it over to Mary because she can describe her business a lot better than I'll be able to.
The President. Fire away, Mary.
Little Wild Things Farm Founder and Chief Veggie Officer Mary Anna Ackley. [Laughter] Sure. We moved here a few years ago, and we are an urban vertical farm located right next door. We grow salad greens, microgreens, and edible flowers. Beautiful salads. We deliver them all over the greater Washington, DC, area, both to homes, and we donate locally here in the neighborhood.
The President. Now, you've been engaged in the neighborhood too. You sponsor a Little League team, don't you?
Mr. Siegel. We do. We sponsor a Little League team. We alsowe run job fairs for special needs programs to get their studentsto help them find employment. We've actually hired three people from thosefrom that job program. It's called ""Project SEARCH."" It's a partnership between a nonprofit and the DC government, and they do a great job training their students, who are special needs, to come and be able to work in an environment like this and be great contributors.
The President. Have you hired any of those folks?
Mr. Siegel. We've hired three.
The President. Three?
Mr. Siegel. Yes.
The President. I'll be darned.
Mr. Siegel. And Mary participated in our first job fair. We were going to do another one, but obviously, the pandemic has halted our ability to do that. But when things go back to normal, we're going to continue to do those job fairs.
The President. Tell me, what kind ofwhat hit you the hardest when the pandemic hit?
Mr. Siegel. Right. So the biggest challenge is what were we going to do with our staff. You know, there were so many uncertainties related to what the virus actually did. The first thing that we did was we took all of our at-risk employees, and we sent them home, and we paid them through that entire process. That first wave of PPP loans was very helpful to allow us to do that. Obviously, that was not cost effective, but we felt like we had to do that for our employees.
You know, and we're still struggling because we dida lot of retail business has actually increased over the course of the pandemic. I think people know there's a little bit of hardware boom.
A big portion of our business is actually Government sales and commercial sales. And, for the first 4 or 5 months, I mean, that was completely gone. And honestly, usually, it's about 60 percent of our annual revenue.
The President. Well, one of the reasons why I changed the rule forit was 20 daysto make sure only employers that had 20 or fewer employees could qualify for PPP. And the reason for that was, 400,000 small businesses went out of business. They got in line, but they couldn't get the help.
And we found out that an awful lot of that went to bigbigger businesses that, in fact, weren't supposed to qualify for this. Because theythere used be a thing called an ""inspector general"" to see where the money went. And the last administration fired the inspector general, so a lot of money went to people who shouldn't have gotten help, and it didn't go to folks whobut you know, the significance with this new programand we're going to continue this, by the wayit's not onlyyou've beenonly businesses with fewer than 20 folks could apply for the last couple weeks.
But now we're going to keep the focus on it because there's a lot of minority-owned businesses, women-owned businesses are increased significantly by 20, 1520 and 15 percent, as well as getting people who, in fact, weren't able to get in line before. And it's hard to know how to get in line.
And so I hope this is going to continue to increase, because we're also at the point where I think we're going to begin to gain control of this virus.
Mr. Siegel. Yes, Iand we appreciate your leadership on that.
One quick point I want to make is that: I said we're the oldest hardware store in DC; I also say we're the greenest hardware store in America. We have two urban farms actually in our building. We have Mary, who is in the garage there, and then we have Cultivate the City, which is an awesome rooftop garden. They exist on our rooftop. But you can'tyou're not going to be able to see it from here, but if they want to give a wave.
The President. I see them.
Mr. Siegel. Yes.
Participants. Hi!
Mr. Siegel. Yes, and then we also have solar panels
The President. Don't jump; we need you. [Laughter]
Mr. Siegel. And then, if I could just

2021-03-08 00:00:00,Remarks on International Women's Day and an Exchange With Reporters,"
The President. Thank you, Madam Vice President, and thank you, Mr. Secretary.
On Friday, I submitted to the Senate for confirmation my first slate of nominations for four-star command positions in our Armed Forces, among them, two outstanding and eminently qualified warriors and patriots. General Jacqueline Van Ovostand United States Air Force is currently the only female four-star officer serving in our military. I nominated her as Commander of the United States Transportation Command.
And when confirmed, the Lieutenant General Laura Richardson, of the United States Army, will be promoted in rank and join General Van Ovost as the only four-staras another four-star general. I nominated her as Commander in the United States Southern Command. And, when confirmed, they will become the second and third women in the history of the United States Armed Forces to lead combatant commands.
Each of these women have led careers demonstrating incomparable skill, integrity, and duty to country. And at every step, they've also helped push open the doors of opportunity to women in our military, blazing the trail a little wider, a little brighter for all the proud women following in their path and looking to their example.
And I wanted to shine the light on these accomplishments for those women today because General Van Ovostas reiterated in an interview this last week, and I'm the second person to say thisit's hard to be what you can't see. It's hard to be what you can't see, but you'll soon see.
Today is International Women's Day. And we all need to see and to recognize the barrier-breaking accomplishments of these women. We need the young women just beginning their careers in the military service to see it and know that no door will be closed to them. We need women and men throughout the ranks to see and celebrate women's accomplishments and leadership in the services. We need little girls and boys both, who have grown up dreaming of serving for their country, to know this is what generals in the United States Armed Forces look like. This is what Vice Presidents of United States look like.
So I'd like to spend just a few minutes today making sure that America knows who General Van Ovost is and Lieutenant General Richardson is. They're aviators. Both learned to fly planes before they were old enough to drive a car.
General Van Ovost, a first-generationis a first-generation American: the daughter of Dutch immigrants who owned a flying operation. She loved the freedom of flight and, as a teenager, flew herself to see Sally Ride lift off as the first woman in space. [Laughter] Sixteen years old, goes down to see Sally Ride. She said she was at several thousand feet watching from a distance.
You know, women weren'twere banned from flying combat missions when the general joined the force, so she focused on becoming a test pilot. And instead of learning to fly just one plane, she learned to fly everything, including Air Force Two when I was Vice President.
General Van Ovost currently isoversees Air Mobility Command: approximately 107,000 airmen and 1,100 planes that enable America's air power and humanitarian assistance to go everywhere in the world it need be. From flying water to Texas after the recent storms to ensuring our wounded warriors are evacuated for medical care from anywhere in the world, she gets it done. Lieutenant General Richardson's parents were proud patriots. It must have rubbed off because Lieutenant General Richardson and her brother and sister all joined the Army. Her father encouraged her to join ROTC in college, even though that meant commuting to a different school.
When Lieutenant General Richardson joined the Army Aviation Branch, women were banned from flying attack helicopters. She flew toin support of combatantcombat missions, and conducting lift operations of her UH-1the so-called ""Huey""and the Blackhawks.
Now, as the commanding general of the United States Army North, Lieutenant General Richardson oversees military ground responses here in North America. All over the last year, that's meant getting military and medical personnel deployed to help in our response to this pandemic. More than 4,500 military medical personnel deployed in hospitals across 14 States and the Navajo Nation to treat COVID-19 patients. It means more than 2,200 medical personnel are working, or soon will be, at vaccination sites in eight States and the United States Virgin Islands.
I'm so proud of the incredible work Lieutenant General Richardson and her team have done to support the American people this year, and the American people are as well. They're warriors. They're crisis-tested commanders.
And best of allbest of allthey're not done yet. Neither of these incredible generals is resting on her laurels or on her stars. They're using their voices and actively working to change policies in the military to make it easier and safer for more women not just to join the military, but to stay in the military and to thrive.
I'm incredibly proud that in 2015, under the Obama-Biden administration, we took the final steps to open up all positions in the military to anyone qualified to serve in them. The women who join today's military aren't told ""no"" when they apply to fly fighter jets or attack helicopters just because of their gender. They aren't told ""no"" when they want to apply to Ranger School or infantry officer basic training.
But they all know that there's much, much more work to be done to ensure that women's leadership is recognized and we have more diverse leaders; we reach the top echelons of command for all who are qualified, including all womenall women; and that all women feel safe and respected in our militaryperiod.
You know, some of it is relatively straightforward work where we're making good progress designing body armor that fits women properly; tailoring combat uniforms for women; creating maternity flight suits; updating requirements for their hairstyles. And some of it is going to takeandyou know, an intensity of purpose and mission to really change the culture and habits that cause women to leave the military:
That women aremaking sure more diverse candidates are consideringbeing considered for career-advancing opportunities at every single level. That women aren't penalized in their careers for having children. That women aren't just token members, but integral parts throughout all branches and all divisions. And that they can completely, fairly engage in promotion and compete all across the board, including on theon age and gender neutrality and physical fitness test.
You know that both members of the military couples can thrive while serving, like Lieutenant General Richardson and her husband, Lieutenant General Richardson, who, I might add, I want to thank you for getting me off a mountain that was about 12- to 14,000 feet up on a goat path when our helicopter went down in a snowstorm. And it's good to see you, General. The ride down that mountain was more perilous in a truck than it was in the helicopter, but thank you.
And we have to take on sexual assault and harassment and violence against women in the military. Sexual assault is abhorrent and wrong at any time. And in our military, where so much of unit cohesion is built on trusting your fellow servicemembers to have your back, there's nothing less than a threat to our national security.
I know Secretary Austin takes this as seriously as Vice President Harris and I do. That's why his first memo as Secretary was a directive to take on sexual assault in the military and why he stepped up independent reviewhe set up an Independent Review Commission on Sexual Assault to make concrete recommendations for changes.
This is going to be an all-hands-on-deck effort under my administration to end the scourge of sexual assault in the military. And we're going to be focused on that from the very top. I know that we can do it. The U.S. Military has defeated American enemies on land, in air, and at sea, and this is not beyond us.
I want to thank General Van Ovost and Lieutenant General Richardson for their exemplary careers and service to our country. You're America's patriotism at its finest: undaunted and absolutelyabsolutely able to do anything by any obstacle; determined to open wide and the doors of opportunity; and ready for the next challenge.
It's my great honor to serve as your Commander in Chief. And I look forward to hearing your Active Duty and recommendations of how we will work together to keep the American people safe to meet every challenge in the 21st century.
So I want to thank you both. And I want to thank the former generalI keep calling him ""General."" But mythe guy who runs that outfit over there. I want to make sure we thank the Secretary for all he's done to try to implement what we've just talked about, and for recommending these two women for promotion.
Thank you all, may God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.
Thank you. [Inaudible]you don't have to speak. [Laughter] Thank you, everybody.

2021-03-07 00:00:00,"Videotaped Remarks at the Martin Luther King, Jr., and Coretta Scott King Unity Breakfast in Selma, Alabama","
Good morning to everyone joining in this unity breakfast named after Dr. and Mrs. King and to commemorate the anniversary of the march in Selma.
I know this is the first commemoration of Bloody Sunday without Reverend C.T. Vivian, Reverend Joseph Lowery, and Congressman John Lewis. Preachers of the social gospel. Architects of the ""Beloved Community,"" they built not only with words but with action. And reminders that in our lifetime, for Black Americans, the fundamental right to vote has been denied by White supremacy hiding both behind white hoods and in plain sight in statehouses and courtrooms.
Yet those torches and burning crosses, the batons, tear gas, firehoses, attack dogs, and unfair laws and trials could not stop progress. The blood of John Lewis and so many other brave and righteous souls that were spilled in Selma on this Sunday in 1965 sanctified a noble struggle. And when the country saw those images that night, America was forced to confront the denial of democracy, the fierce urgency of justice.
Congress passed the Voting Rights Act a few months later, and President Johnson signed it into law. But the legacy of the march in Selma is that while nothing can stop free people from exercising their most sacred power as a citizen, there are those who will do anything they can to take that power away.
The Voting Rights Act began to dismantle barriers to voting and to make our elections more fair, free, and representative. I was always proud to lead the efforts to reauthorize it over the years as a U.S. Senator in the Judiciary Committee. But at the same time, Republicans at every level have chipped away at it.
Then in 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act, holding that times have changed and blatant voter discrimination was rare, contrary to the assault that was taking place on the ground. The late Justice Ginsburg wrote that the decision was like ""throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm."" Today, we have a hailstorm, not a rainstorm. A hailstorm.
And in 2020, our very democracy on the line, even in the midst of a pandemic, more Americans voted than ever before. Multiple recounts in States and decisions in more than 60 casesfrom judges appointed by my predecessor, including at the Supreme Courtupheld the integrity of this historic election.
Instead of celebrating this powerful demonstration of voting, we have seen an unprecedented insurrection in our Capitol and a brutal attack on our democracy on January the 6th. And never beforea never-before-seen effort to ignore, undermine, and undo the will of the people.
And to think of that, and yet it's been followed by an all-out assault on the right to vote in State legislatures all across the country. During the current legislative sessions, elected officials in 43 States have already introduced over 250 bills to make it harder for Americans to vote. We cannot let them succeed.
Last week, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 1, the For the People Act of 2021. This is a landmark piece of legislation that is urgently needed to protect the right to vote, the integrity of our elections, and to repair and strengthen our democracy. I hope the Senate does its work so that I can sign it into law. I also urge Congress to fully restore the Voting Rights Act, named in John Lewis's honor.
Today, on the anniversary of Bloody Sunday, I am signing an Executive order to make it easier for eligible voters to register to vote and improve access to voting. Every eligible voter should be able to vote and have that vote counted. If you have the best ideas, you have nothing to hide. Let the people vote.
And I'll close with this: A few days before he passed, Jill and I spoke with John, Congressman Lewis. But instead of answering our concerns about himwe talked about ""how are you doing, John""he asked us to stay focused on the work left undone to heal and to unite this Nation around what it means to be an American. That's the God's truth. John wouldn't talk about his pending death or his concerns. He said we've just got to get this done.
That we are all created equal. That we all deserve to be treated equally. On this day of reflection, please, let's stay focused on the work ahead. Let's remember all those who came before us, as a bridge to our history so we don't forget its pain and as a bridge to our future so we never lose our hope.
May God bless their memory, may God bless you all, and may God protect our forces.

2021-03-06 00:00:00,Remarks on Senate Passage of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 and an Exchange With Reporters,"
The President. Good afternoon.
It's a good day today. You know, when we took office 45 days ago, I promised the American people that help was on the way. Today I can say we've taken one more giant step forward in delivering on that promise that help is on the way.
I want to thankstart off by thanking the Vice President, but I want to thank all of the Senators who worked so hard to reach a compromise to do the right thing for the American people during this crisis and voted to pass the American Rescue Plan. It obviously wasn't easy, it wasn't always pretty, but it was so desperately needed, urgently needed.
Also, I also need to say a few words about the Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who I spoke with many times on this and again this morning. I served in the Senate, as you all know, for many years. I've never seen anyone work as skillfully, as ably, as patiently, with determination, to deliver such a consequential piece of legislation that was so urgently needed as the American Rescue Plan.
Chuck SchumerSenator Chuck Schumer, when the country needed you most, you led, Chuck, and you delivered. Neither I nor the country will ever forget that. And it's not a moment too soon. I've been talking about the urgency of this need.
For manyfor over a year, the American people were told they were on their own. They were seeingwe've seen how hard that has been on so many Americans. As of last night, 519,064 lives lost to the virus. That many empty chairs this morningthe breakfast tablegone. More than 400 [400,000]* small businesses closed unnecessarily. Millions of people out of work through no fault of their own. I want to emphasize that: through no fault of their own. Food bank lines stretching for miles. Did any of you ever you'd see that in America, in cities all across this country? Families facing the threat of eviction.
This Nation has suffered too much for much too long. And everything in this package is designed to relieve the suffering and to meet the most urgent needs of the Nation and put us in a better position to prevail, starting with beating this virus and vaccinating the country.
The resources in this plan will be used to expand and speed up manufacturing and distribution of vaccines so we can get every single American vaccinated sooner than later. I believe bywe'll have enough by the end ofby the middle of May to vaccinate. It's going to take longer to take longer to get it in their arm, but that's how much vaccine we'll have.
Because of all the funding, we'll be able to hire more vaccinators, set up more vaccination sites to get the country in a place to get back to normal. This plan will get checks out the door, starting this month, to the American people who so desperately need the help, many of whom are lying in bed at night, staring at the ceiling, wondering: ""Will I lose my job, if I haven't already? Will I lose my insurance? Will I lose my home?""
Over 85 percent of American households will get direct payments of $1,400 per person. For a typical middle class family of fourhusband and wife working, making $100,000 a year total, with three kidsthey'll get $5,600I mean, with two kidswill get $5,600, and it will be on the way soon. That means the mortgage can get paid. That means the child can stay in community college. That means maintaining the health insurance you have. It's going to make a big difference in so many of lives in this country.
Unemployment benefits will be extended for 11 million Americans who have lost their jobs and who, last night, again were lying in bed, just thinking, ""My lord, I'm going to lose my unemployment insurance in a week or so."" It was about to expire.
Schools are going to have the resources they need to open safely. States and local governments that have lost tens of thousands of essential workers will behave the resources they need available to them, to those laid-off police officers, firefighters, teachers, and nurses they can rehire. They're ourthese are essential personnel.
Look, the American Rescue Plan lowers health care premiums. Food and nutrition assistance. It's hard to believe that 24 million adults and 11 million children, as I speak, in the United States suffer from food insecurity. That means, simply, they don't have enough food to eat. Did you ever imagine in the United States of America, you'd see lines, literally miles longkidsfolks in their automobiles, waiting for a box of food to be put in their trunk. I stood in line, handing out food. The people coming up never, ever, ever thought they'd be in that position. This helps families who are behind on their rent and their mortgage payments so they aren't thrown out of their homes.
Look, the bottom line is this: This plan puts us on the path to beating the virus. This plan gives those families who are struggling the most the help and the breathing room they need to get through this moment. This plan gives small businesses in this country a fighting chance to survive.
And one more thing: This plan is historic. Taken altogether, this plan is going to make it possible to cut child poverty in half. Let me say that againit's significant, historicit will cut child poverty in half.
There's much more to this bill, but for now, let me make one final point. When I was elected, I said we were going to get the Government out of the business of battling on Twitter and back in the business of delivering for the American people, of making a difference in their lives, giving everyone a chancea fighting chanceof showing the American people that their Government can work for them. And passing the American Rescue Plan will do that.
And you know, it may sound strange, but a lot of Senators and Congressmen I want to thank, but I really want to thank the American people for making all of this possible. You say, ""Well, how do they make it possible?"" Well, quite frankly, without the overwhelming bipartisan support of the American people, this would not have happened. Your elected officials heard you. Overwhelming public supportevery public opinion poll shows overwhelming support for this plan. And for the last weeks, it's shown that. Every public opinion poll shows the people want this, they believe it's needed, and they believe it's urgent.
And now this bill returns to the House of Representatives, which has done a great job from the beginning, where I hope it will find quick passage so it can be sent to my desk to be signed into law.
By passing the American Rescue Plan, we'll have heeded the voice of the American people, not ignored their voices. By passing this plan, we will have delivered real, tangible results for the American people and their families, and they'll be able to see and know and feel the change in their own lives. And by passing this plan, we'll have proved that this Government, this democracy can still work. What has to be doneit will improve people's lives. And one more thing: The vast majority of economistsleft, right, and centerfrom Wall Street to the private economic polling initiatives, the economistsas I've said, left, right, and centersay, ""In addition to the needs the people have, we need this to grow the economy."" That if we haven't spent this money and recreated the kind of incentive for people to be able to make a good living, that we'd be in real trouble.
This will create millions of new jobsit's estimated over 6 million new jobs by itself; increase the Gross Domestic Product by a trillion dollars; put our Nation in a position to out-compete the rest of the worldbecause the rest of the world is moving, particularly China; and to know that as tough as this moment is, there are brighter days ahead. There really are.
As I've said before, it's never a good bet to bet against America. It's never been a good bet to bet against the American people. We are America. We're going to get there. We're going to remain the leading economy in the world and going to be the most successful economy in the world because of you, the American people.
Thank you, and God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Thank you.
Q. Mr. President, why couldn't you get a single Republican vote on this bill? What do you think the drama
[At this point, several reporters began speaking at once.]
The President's Agenda 
Q. Why do you think you didn't get a single Republican vote, and what does the drama of the last 24 hours, including with Senator Manchin, tell you about the next 4 years?
The President. They're going to be good. I'm going to succeed. We're going to succeed moving forward.
Look, the American people strongly support what we're doing. That's the key here. And that's going to continue to seep down through the public, including from our Republican friends. There's a lot of Republicans that came very close. They've got a lot of pressure on them. I still haven't given up on getting their support.
Thank you.
Q. [Inaudible]the compromises?
The President. Pardon me?
Economic Stimulus and Pandemic Relief Legislation 
Q. Your message to House Democrats who were frustrated with some of the compromises in the Senate bill, particularly
The President. They're not frustrated. Bernie Sanders said this is the most progressive bill he's ever seen passed in history, since he's been here. And the compromises were all compromises that didn't affect the substance and the essence of what the bill is. Going from $300from $400 to $300, to the unemployment excess. Well, it got extended until September. The end result is the essentially about the same. And so I don't think any of the compromises have in any way fundamentally altered the essence of what I put in the bill in the first place.
Thank you.

2021-03-05 00:00:00,Remarks in a Roundtable Discussion on the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021,"
The President. Thanks for being here, everybody. This is important, and I appreciate you being willing to come and tell your stories.
I wanted this to be a conversation about what the impact of the $1,400 that our plan has for every American out there and to make sure that I understand what you think is important about it, if you think it's important.
And I also want toyou know, the people you're about to meet, the millions of people who are going to help with thisI thinkwith this check, that's going to make a big difference in terms of their lives.
And people in the country are hurting right now, with less than 2 weeks from enhanced unemployment checks being cut out. And 7 million kids don't have enough food; 13 million people are behind in their rent. And the American Rescue Plan, I believeand according to the polling data, the vast majority of Americans believeis essential to giving them some help and to turn it around.
And I think it's going to provide immediate relief for millions of people that are going to be able to use it in a very constructive way and also grow the economy in the process. But it's essential getting kids back to school safely. It is also getting a lifeline to small businesses, many of whom400,000have gone under, affecting entire communities. And it is clearlyclearlynecessary a lifeline for getting the upper hand against COVID-19 and getting it under control.
That isn't some academic discussion. It's about you; it's about people like you and the families I grew up with all over America. And you know, you've all lived lives of service. You not only have taken care of yourself and your families, but you've lived lives of service to help other people as well.
And so, asagain, this isn't an academic discussion. You deserve our thanks and our support. And I'm going to hand it back to Cedric so we can hear from you all while the press is still in here.
White House Director of Public Engagement Cedric L. Richmond. Well, thank you, Mr. President. Today we're joined by three outstanding Americans that exemplify what America stands for and especially your values, which is service to others.
And, first, we have Ms. Alma Williams. Ms. Williams is a paratransit driver. She transports disabled Americans every day. She has four wonderful children, and her youngest is in the process of applying to college. The other two are in college, and one is on her way. So Ms. Williams is close to being a empty nester.
Then, we have George Kerr, who served in the United States Navy for almost 8 years; served on two Air Force carriers. And he volunteers, but also is starting a nonprofit small business to help people with substance use issues and health and harm effects. And he haswhich you mentioned earlierthe unfortunate experience of having a house that burned down. And I know that you know that experience very well. And he's just a remarkable individual.
And then, we have Ms. Lyda Vanegas, who volunteers at a DC community health center and spends her time counseling and helping Americans get through this very rough time. And she has seen the effects, firsthand, of the challenges and the pain and the suffering that American citizens are going through, which is particularly important that you say ""through no fault of their own.""
And with that, Mr. President, I'm going to turn it back over tonow we'll turn it over to Ms. Williams so that she can tell us about what she thinks about the American Rescue Plan.
Washington Metro Access Transit Authority driver Alma Williams. Actually, it's a wonderful plan. As well as being a paratransit operator, I'm also union rep for the ATU.
The President. ATU.
Ms. Williams. Yes, sir. And you know, just hearing the things that, you know, my coworkers go through is devastating. You know, we're fighting to work a maximum of less than 40 hours a week, you know? And as I stated to a colleague of mine whenwe had a time when we paid our bills on the first of the month, and now we're struggling to pay them on the 15th just to
The President. And you're still employed?
Ms. Williams. Yes. You know? And it's just a hard time financially, mentally, emotionallylike, across the board for children, adults. You know?
And it's justI thank you for the plan. I think it will help a wide range of peopleyou know, not just the working class, but our retirees; you know, our elementary school, you knowthe grade schools thatI have nieces and nephews who are very young. And just the transition of going to school every day and now being home all day, stuck behind a computer, it's draining for them too, and they don't understand it. You know? Thank you. I appreciate it.
The President. Okay. I have a lot of questions, but I'm going until we hearwhile the press is hereto hear from all three people.
Ms. Williams. Yes, sir.
The President. I'd like to talk more about this, if I can.
Director Richmond. Thank you, Mr. President. With that, we'll turn it over to you, Mr. Kerr.
Navy veteran George Kerr. Well, once again, thank you for having me. It's really important that we're having this conversation. I'm in full support of this piece of important legislation.
As you said, I lost my home inNovember 30, 2019. And then, right after that, I got really sick and then COVID happened. And thankfully I did nothave not contracted COVID. But it's led to a lot of other issues.
And being anhaving my own LLC, it's very difficult to find contracts right there because of the environment. And people are just notdon't have the funding to get the support they need.
And so I do a lot of work with different organizations. One of them is Mary's House for Older Adults, where we have areach out and touch someone, who talks to seniorsLGBTQ seniorsabout isolation and being in contact with them. And so mental health is just real important. And I'm glad see there's a lot of money in there for mental health services, because it's incredibly important.
And at the same time, my communitythe LGBTQ communityis under attack on a constant basis. And we need tothe trauma that's around there, we need toneeds to be addressed. And I'm hoping and praying that you will be able to sign into law the Equality Act.
The President. So am I.
Mr. Kerr. Thank you.
Director Richmond. And last, but certainly not least, is Ms. Lyda Vanegas.
Mary's Center Vice President of Marketing and Communications Lyda Vanegas. Well, first of all, thank you so much. Thank you for allowing Mary's Centeryou know, on behalf of Mary's Center, being me here, you know, to share this story of the many, many families that we have served during this pandemic.
[Ms. Vanegas continued her remarks, concluding as follows.]
So, you know, it's this circle of situations that have been impacting all of our families. So, you know, with that comes mental health, trauma, anxiety. And our children don't have laptops. We have been able to distribute about 1,000 laptops or more.
Ms. Williams. Very good.
Ms. Vanegas. But you know, if they have one laptop, but they have three children, how can they all be in school on the same day? So they have to choose. Or they don't have internet connection. So there's a lot around that, and we've been trying to support as much as possible.
The President. Well, thank you forall of you for what you do. I carry a schedule card with me every day, and on back of the card, I list, on a daily basis, how many people have died from COVID in the United States. As of today, 517,224not over 500,000; five thousand517,224. And we will meet the 100 million shots. We're up to 82,572,848 shots. We're going to get this done.
So I'm going to ask some questions now. The press is going to leave, and I'm going to get more personal with you, if I can, and ask some questions if it's okay.

2021-03-05 00:00:00,Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen,"
The President. Welcome, folks. Can you hear me in my mask?
Q. Yes, sir.
The President. All right. We're about to have an economic meeting, but I want to make a few very brief comments.
Today's jobs report shows that the American Rescue Plan is urgently needed, in our view.
Now, our economy still has 9.5 million fewer jobs than it had this time last year. And at that rate, it would take 2 years to get us back on track. We have 1 million fewer educators1 million fewer educatorsthan we did this time last year. We've lost 400,000 small businesses. All those empty storefronts aren't just shattered dreams, they're warning lights that are going off in State and local budgets that are being stretched because of the lack of tax revenue.
And some of last month's job growth is a result of the December relief package. But without a rescue plan, these gains are going to slow. We can't afford one step forward and two steps backwards. We need to beat the virus, provide essential relief, and build an inclusive recovery.
People need the help now. In less than 2 weeks, enhanced unemployment benefits will begin to expire for 11 million people. At least 7 million kids don't have enough food to eat on a regular basis. Thirteen million people are behind in their rent.
And the rescue plan is absolutely essential for turning this around, getting kids back to school safely, getting a lifeline to small business, and getting the upper hand on COVID-19. That's what we're going to be talking about now.
So I thank you all for coming on in. Thank you.
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, when will you unveil your Build Back Better plan?

The President. Yes.
Director Watkins. This is Mike Watkins at JPL.
The President. Hey, Mike. How are you?
Director Watkins. I want to thank you so much. We are very well, especially after theafter February 18.
The President. I tell you what: You did an incredible job.
Director Watkins. We thank you for that, and we appreciate that. And it's our honor to be given these kinds of tasks; it's what we live for.
And so you may see here I'm surrounded by a few hundred of my best friends in this and a couple of other control rooms and online. You know, these are really big team efforts
The President. I know.
Director Watkins. and it's important to us to get as much of the team to join with us today as we could. And we really appreciate your time.
The President. Appreciate it. I'm flattered you'd take the time to let me talk to you.
Director Watkins. Well, we would love to have you out here someday. In fact, I've got two badges for you and the Vice President. So when COVID winds down, I hope you come out here and have a chance to meet the team directly.
The President. I'll be happy to do that. I'll be happy to do that.
Am I supposed to speak now or is Swati?
Director Watkins. Thanks. We would love it. You know, one of the things I wanted to also noteI thinkyou know, youI know you watchedI saw pictures of you watching the landing coverage.
The President. Yes.
Director Watkins. And you know, that was a great opportunity, you know, for us to show, I think, the country what, you know, we can doand the world, reallybut also, you know, to bring a whole new generation of STEM, you know, into the fold.
The President. That's right.
Director Watkins. And I think we had a lot of people watching who didn't know that they were STEM people, but now they are
The President. Yes.
Director Watkins. after having watched that. And it's something weyou know, it's very important to us. It's a major part of what we do here at JPL and, of course, NASA as an agency. And we'reit's just great to have thatyou know, that bully pulpit to showcase that talent.
The President. It's incredible talent.
Now, am I supposed to speak or is Swati going to say something? I was told I was going to hear from Swati.
Director Watkins. So either wayany way you'd like to do it is fine. We have Dr. Mohan here with me. Sheof course, you know her from the landing coverage. But
The President. Hey, Doc. How are you?
Jet Propulsion Laboratory Engineer Swati Mohan. I'm doing very well, Mr. President. Thank you for
The President. I just want you to know
Engineer Mohan. for taking the time to speak with us.
The President. Are you kidding me? What an honor this is. This is an incredible honor. And it's amazing. Indianof descentAmericans are taking over the country: you; my Vice President; my speechwriter Vinay. I tell you what. But thank you. You guys are incredible.
Did you want to say something? I'll be quiet.
Director Watkins. Absolutely. You know, tell us how you felt on landing day and, actually, what path brought you to here at the lab.
Engineer Mohan. Absolutely. So my path actually started way back when I was a child, watching my first episode of Star Trek. [Laughter] In addition to those fantastical scenes of space, what really captured my attention was this really close-knit team who was working together, manipulating this technological marvel with the sole purpose of exploring space and understanding new things and seeking new life.
You know, Perseverance is my first mission at JPL where I've gotten to work from the very beginning of formulation, all the way through operations, and it made me feel like I was part of that crew. Being able to work with this incredibly diverse, talented team that has become like a family, spending years creating our own technological marvel has been a privilege.
You know, those last days and weeks leading up to landing day, it was pretty smooth, but we were all still really nervous
The President. Yes. [Laughter]
Engineer Mohan. and, frankly, terrified until we got through those final 7 minutes. To be able to call ""touchdown"" safely, to see those first images come back from Mars, to see the place where we have never been able to go to on Mars before and go therereach there for the express purpose of seeking out new life just made it feel like I was living in a dream.
Now that that tremendous relief has passed for the team of being able to be there safely, all that's left is the excitement and the thrill of all the scientific discoveries that are yet to come and what Perseverance can actually find and, hopefully, find those signs of past life on Mars.
The President. Well, I tell you what, you said you feel like you're ""living a dream""you've created a dream for millions and millions of young kids, young Americans. You talk about STEM. Youit waslook, the thing that I found so exhilarating about this: You all did thisthe whole teamthe team, in fact, I can see now and the entire team at JPLwhat you did: You restored a dose of confidence in the American people.
They were beginning to wonder about us. They were beginning to wonder: Are we still the country we always believed we were? You guys did it. You guys gave a sense of ""America is back."" It's astounding what you did. You should not underestimate it. You should not underestimate it. You know, you did it the most American way: You believed in science, you believed in hard work, and you believed there wasn't a darn thing you couldn't do if you put your minds together.
One of the reasons why we're such an incredible country is, we're such a diverse country. We bring the best out of every single solitary culture in the world here in the United States of America, and we give people an opportunity to let their dreams run forward.
And you justI can't tell you how muchyou know, everyone was so down the last years about: Is America still the, you know, the fount of change? And are we still the country that has hopes and develops and pursues the most unlikely things to happen? And we are. And you all demonstrated it.
I'm not beinglook, I'm notI really mean this. It's so much bigger than landing Perseverance on Mars. It's about the American spirit, and you brought it back. You brought back in a moment we so desperately need it.
I was reachingI was talking to a head of state who was calling me about thanking meor not thanking mecongratulating me on becoming President. And then, I later heard from another head of state, saying: ""America has changed so much. They used to be so competent to do great things, and here they can't even deal with the coronavirus. Look how badly organized they are."" That was said by a head of state.
And America's image in the worldand it matters. It matters because democracies have to demonstrate they can run as efficiently and more efficiently than autocracies. There's a big battle going on. Your kids are going to be studying about when democracy once again reestablished it could do anything, as opposed to autocracies that can just command things.
I just can't tell you how much I believe historians are going to write about what you did at the moment you all did itat the moment you all did it. You should take such great pridesuch great pridein what you did.
We can land a rover on Mars. We can beat a pandemic. And with science, hope, and vision, there's not a damn thing we can't do as a country. We have never, ever, ever failed to meet a goal. We've set our mind to it, and we've done it together. And that's what you all showed. So it goes way beyondway beyondthe whole notion of what you just recently did.
And God only knows what is going to come from this. God only knows what's going to happen. But you all are incredible. All the dreams you've created in other people's minds, other young kids.
I tell you what: I just wanted to thank you and tell you, you know, youit just seems that, you know, we're on the side of the angels. Just at the moment when things look like they're really dark in America over our history, something has come along. Something has come along. And you guys came along and you did this.
And so I just want to thank you from the bottom of my heart and tell you how presumptuous of me to say I'm proud of you, but I am so proud of you. And, Mike, the teamwork that still exists there, the importance of it, the consequence of what you're doingand it's only just the start.
I had a group of folks in my office not too long agoHouse and Senate MembersI mean, House MembersDemocrats and Republicanstalking about infrastructure. And I have in theon the shelf in my Oval Office, a Moon rock. And they walked over and said, ""This is actually a Moon rock, from the Moon?"" And I jokingly said: ""You ain't seen nothing yet. Wait until see what comes home from Mars."" So, anyway, folks, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You're great Americans, and you've demonstrated it again: There's not a thing we cannot do when we set our mind to it.
God bless you all. Thank you. Thanks, Mike.
