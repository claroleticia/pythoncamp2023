2023-08-18 00:00:00,"The President's News Conference with President Yoon Suk Yeol of the Republic of Korea and Prime Minister Kishida Fumio of Japan at Camp David, Maryland","
PRESIDENT BIDEN: Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Camp David.
If I seem like I'm happy, it's because I am. (Laughter.) This has been a great, great meeting.
Mr. President, Mr. Prime Minister, I -- we meet in this historic place to make a historic moment. And I believe that to be true. The -- this is a new era in partnership between Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the United States -- our new Camp David trilat. (Laughs.) That's what we have here.
And -- but before we dive into the progress we've made today -- if you excuse, we used to say in the Senate, ""a point of personal privilege"" -- I want to start by expressing my appreciation for the contribution that your countries have made toward the relief following the devastating wildfires in Hawaii. I want to thank you both on behalf of the American people.
I also want to note that my team is closely monitoring Hurricane Hilary, which is -- has the potential to bring significant rain and flooding to southern California. FEMA has pre-positioned personnel and supplies in the region, and they're ready to respond as needed. I urge everyone -- everyone in the path of this storm to take precautions and listen to the guidance from state and local officials.
And you've heard me say it before: The Republic of Korea and Japan are capable and indispensable allies.
Now, to the purpose of why we're here.
America's commitment to both countries is ironclad, and my personal commitment to bringing these three nations together was real from the very beginning.
Since last summer, we've met on the margins of the NATO Summit in Spain, the ASEAN Summit in Cambodia, and the G7 Summit in Japan. And today, we've made history with the first-ever standalone summit between the leaders of our three countries, as well as our commitment to meet together on the leader level annually and to have all of our relative Cabinet-member people meet on a regular basis for -- from this point on; not just this year, not next year -- forever. That's the i- -- that's the intention.
And so, I want to recognize the important work that both of you have done and the political courage -- and I mean this sincerely -- the political courage that you've both demonstrated to resolve difficult issues that would've stood in the way for a long time of a close relationship between Japan and Korea and with the United States.
Your leadership, with the full support of the United States, has brought us here, because each of you understands that our world stands at an inflection point -- a point where we're called to lead in new ways: to work together, to stand together. And today, I'm proud to say our nations are answering that call.
First, we're elevating our trilateral defense collaboration to deliver in the Indo-Pacific region. That includes launching annual multidomain military exercises, bringing our trilateral defense cooperation to an unprecedented levels.
We're doubling down on information sharing, including on the DPRK's missile launches and cyber activities, strengthening our ballistic missile defense cooperation.
And, critically -- critically, we've all committed to swiftly consult with each other in response to threats to any one of our countries from whatever source it occurs. That means we'll have a hotline to share information and coordinate our responses whenever there is a crisis in the region or affecting any one of our countries.
And today, we've reaffirmed -- all reaffirmed our shared commitment to maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and addressing ec- -- and addressing economic coercion.
We're going to continue to counter threats from the DPRK, including cryptocurrency money laundering to the tune of billions of dollars; potential arms transfer in support of Russia's brutal war against Ukraine.
And together -- together, we're going to stand up for international law, freedom of navigation, and the peaceful resolution of disputes in the South China Sea.
Second, we're expanding our economic cooperation to build an Ino -- an Indo-Pacific that is peaceful and prosperous.
Today, we've committed to launch a new -- what we call a ""Supply Chain Early Warning System"" -- excuse me, a Supply Chain Early Warning System Pilot and -- which will alert our nations to disruptions of certain products and materials, like critical minerals or batteries, so we can get ahead of the issues as we -- they appear with the experience -- that we've experienced in -- during the pandemic.
(Referring to a piece of audio equipment.) Excuse me, this is falling off. There you go.
And -- and building on the G7-led Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, we're deepening cooperation between our development finance institutions to mobilize more financing for quality infrastructure and secure communications technology to help low-income and middle-income countries throughout the region take on the challenges that matter most to their people.
And finally, our partnership is about building a better future for our people. That's why we're deepening our cooperation on global health and launching a trilateral expert exchange in support of the U.S. Cancer Moonshot initiative. That's going to, I believe, change cancer as we know it.
It matters a great deal to me and to families all across our three countries. In the United States, we are revolutionizing the way we do cancer research. And together, the three of us, I am confident we can harness our shared spirit of innovation and end cancer as we know it.
We're also launching a new collaboration between our National Laboratories and advance our science knowledge and technological capabilities together. As we do, we'll work in lockstep to set the standards for safe, secure, and trustworthy emerging technology, including artificial intelligence, which a lot of work has to be done on.
Let me close with this. Mr. President, Mr. Prime Minister, this is the first summit I've hosted at Camp David as President. I can think of no more fitting location to begin the next era -- our next era of cooperation -- a place that has long symbolized the power of new beginnings and new possibilities.
In the months and years ahead, we're going to continue to seize those possibilities together -- unwavering in our unity and unmatched in our resolve. This is not about a day, a week, or month. This is about decades and decades of relationships that we're building.
Mr. Prime Minister and Mr. President, I want to thank you for your leader, and I -- leadership -- and I say it again -- for your courage that brought us together. And I look forward to working with you both of you ahead.
Now I yield to -- who am I yielding to?
MODERATOR: Distinguished guests --
PRESIDENT BIDEN: There you go.
MODERATOR: -- the President of the Republic of Korea.
PRESIDENT BIDEN: We needed the voice of God to tell us that. (Laughter.)
PRESIDENT YOON: (As interpreted.) First of all, I'd like to thank President Biden for his warm hospitality. It is a great pleasure to visit Camp David along with Prime Minister Kishida. Camp David is a site that bears historical significance where important diplomatic decisions were made at critical junctures of modern history.
In order to respond to today's unprecedented polycrisis, the ties between our three countries, which are the most advanced liberal democracies in the region and major economies leading advanced technology and scientific innovation, are more important than ever.
From this moment on, Camp David will be remembered as a historic place where the Republic of Korea, the United States, and Japan proclaimed that we will bolster the rules-based international order and play key roles to enhance regional security and prosperity based on our shared values of freedom, human rights, and rule of law.
Today, we, the three leaders, held the very first standalone trilateral summit marking a new chapter in our trilateral cooperation. Today, we have agreed on the Camp David principles that will function as the enduring guidelines for our trilateral cooperation. In addition, we have developed the Spirit of Camp David, which is a document embodying the vision of our trilateral cooperation and ways to translate our will to cooperate into action.
First of all, to facilitate the stable development of our trilateral cooperation, we have built the institutional basis for the trilateral cooperation at multiple levels and sectors. In addition to making our trilateral summit regular, we have agreed to have our governments' personnel at all levels -- including foreign ministers, defense ministers, and national security advisors -- meet every year to closely coordinate our trilateral cooperation.
In particular, we, the three leaders, have agreed to establish a communication channel so we can swiftly coordinate and respond together in case an urgent issue occurs in the region.
Furthermore, to bolster our trilateral strategic cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, our three countries will establish the ROK, U.S., Japan Indo-Pacific dialogue, which will discover new areas of cooperation. Also, along with the economic security dialogue led by our three countries' NSCs, we have agreed to found a consultative body for development policy coordination and also build cooperation frameworks in various sectors including global health and women empowerment.
We have also decided to hold our ROK, U.S., and Japan Global Leadership Youth Summit to strengthen ties between our future generations.
Second, we have agreed to step up our security cooperation to ensure our people's safety and peace in the region based on the now institutionalized Cooperation Framework.
First of all, to this end, we have consulted on practical ways to cooperate, aimed at improving our joint response capabilities to North Korea's nuclear and missile threats, which have become sophisticated more than ever. The real-time sharing of DPRK missile warning data, which was agreed upon during the Phnom Penh summit last November, will be activated within this year. And this will make a significant progress in strengthening our three nations' capabilities to detect and track North Korea's missiles.
In countering the DPRK's nuclear and missile threats, we concurred the trilateral defense exercises were crucial. As such, annual plans will be established for the ROK, U.S., Japan drills we committed to.
In the meantime, as North Korea funds its nuclear and missile programs by exploiting labor and human rights, efforts to monitor and stem such activities will be redoubled. To deter the DPRK's illicit funding activities, a new trilateral working group on DPRK cyber activities will be established.
Moreover, Korea, the U.S., and Japan, in their pursuit of Indo-Pacific strategies, oppose any unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force.
Respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity, the peaceful settlement of disputes, among others, undergird a rules-based international order that we resolve to safeguard by intensifying our collaboration.
As part of such endeavors, our three nations agreed to support ASEAN and Pacific Island countries with their maritime security capacity-building efforts.
Furthermore, to help Ukrainians regain freedom and pursue reconstruction, we are determined to increase our three-way coordination.
Next, we, the three leaders, discussed how to work together to promote shared prosperity and future growth. First of all, in the field of economic security directly linked to our national economies of the three countries, we will work to expand our strategic partnership.
To ensure global supply chain resilience and energy security, we pledged to bolster our trilateral cooperation. To manage global supply chain risks, an early warning system will be established together.
In addition, we decided to broaden our collaboration in the field of cutting-edge technologies to secure future growth engines. Specifically, in AI, quantum, bio, and next-generation telecommunications and space sectors, cooperation among our three countries will deliver powerful synergies.
Korea, the U.S., and Japan committed to have their national laboratories expand joint R&D and personnel exchanges, providing a cornerstone for the three countries' leadership in science and technology innovation.
Moreover, for the sake of shared prosperity in the Asia Pacific, in line with the needs of ASEAN and Pacific Island countries, effective support measures will be sought and implemented collectively.
Today, we, the three leaders, affirmed our commitment to the trilateral partnership towards a new era and possibilities thereof.
Grounded in the core values of freedom, human rights, and the rule of law, a strong alliance of values among Korea, the U.S., and Japan will help build a world that's more peaceful and prosperous by serving as a sturdy foundation.
Mr. President, I thank you once again for your hospitality. Next time, I hope that we will be reunited in the Republic of Korea.
Thank you. (Applause.)
MODERATOR: Distinguished guests, the Prime Minister of Japan.
PRESIDENT BIDEN: President.
PRIME MINISTER KISHIDA: (As interpreted.) Thank you. First of all, in Maui, Hawaii, wildfires caused devastating damage. I express my sympathy, and I really pray for the peace of those who have lost their lives.
In order to offer support, a total of $2 million worth of support by our country has been decided. And the full -- the relief for the affected people and for the earliest recovery of the affected areas, Japan will proactively do our contribution.
Today, I have visited Camp David, and the three of us have spent a truly meaningful time. I expressed my heartfelt gratitude to Joe for the kind invitation.
Together with Joe and President Yoon, this has been a precious opportunity for myself to further deepen the relationship of trust and confidence. For the first time ever, instead of in the sidelines of multilateral conferences, we have held the trilateral summit on a standalone basis.
Here at Camp David, numerous historical meetings have taken place. And it is a huge honor to have printed a fresh page in its history with this meeting.
The foundation of the trilateral collaboration are the solid, firm, bilateral relationships. The three of us have understood this more than anyone else and have executed our understanding in practice.
In January of this year, I visited the United States, and later, President Yoon visited Japan in March and then to the U.S. in April. And in May, I myself traveled to South Korea, and we have bolstered our mutual relationship.
At the moment, the free and open international order, based on the rule of law, is in crisis. Due to Russia's aggression of Ukraine, the international order is shaken from its foundation. The unilateral attempt to change the status quo by force in the East and South China Seas are continuing. And the nuclear and missile threat of North Korea is only becoming ever larger.
Under such circumstances, to make our trilateral strategic collaboration blossom and bloom is only logical and almost inevitable and is required in this era.
The three of us here today declare our determination to pioneer the new era of Japan, U.S., ROK partnership.
How we will advance the cooperation of our three countries going forward, I will discuss from three perspectives.
Firstly, the coordination between the Japan-U.S. and the U.S.-ROK alliances will be reinforced, and trilateral security cooperation will be brought to a new height.
At this meeting, we agreed to hold the Japan-U.S.-ROK multidomain joint exercises on an annual basis. Furthermore, regarding the real-time sharing of North Korea's missile warning information that we agreed last November, the initial steps have been implemented and an important first step has been advanced towards the launch of the mechanism by the end of the year.
We also agreed on the establishment of the working group on North Korea cyber activities, considered to be the source of finance for nuclear and missile development and on other matters.
The second point is the promotion of cooperation between the United States, Japan, and South Korea and the expansion of their areas of cooperation regarding the response to North Korea.
In addition to strengthening regional deterrence and response capabilities, the three countries agreed to strengthen cooperation for the full implementation of sanctions and to work closely together in the U.N. Security Council, where all three countries will be members in 2024.
At the same time, we shared our recognition that the way is open for dialogue with North Korea. I then stated that the abduction issue is a humanitarian issue with time constraints and once again received the strong support of Joe and President Yoon for the immediate resolution of this matter.
We also agreed to work together through the Indo-Pacific dialogue and the development cooperation to realize a free and open Indo-Pacific and, in particular, to coordinate capacity-building support in the domain of maritime security, particularly with regard to ASEAN and Pacific Island countries.
Furthermore, we agreed to promote cooperation in the field of economic security, including critical and emerging technologies and supply chain resilience.
Third, developing a framework for trilateral cooperation. This will create a foundation for continuous and stable enhancement of coordination among the three countries.
After confirming that the three countries will promote multi-layered cooperation at all levels, it was agreed that the trilateral summit meeting will be held at least once a year.
And likewise, the ministers of foreign affairs, defense, and national security advisors will each also meet at least once a year. And the financial minister, as well as the industry and commerce ministers, will be meeting.
We will consider the Camp David principles issued today at a historic turning point for the international community to be a new compass for trilateral cooperation, and we will vigorously implement the concrete cooperation outlined in the Camp David statement of Japan, ROK, and U.S. on our partnership.
Together with Joe and President Yoon, we will continue to work to further strengthen the strategic partnership between the three countries in order to safeguard a free and open international order based on the rule of law.
Thank you. (Applause.)
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Thank you. Now we have time for questions. President Biden, please select your reporter first.
PRESIDENT BIDEN: Aamer, with the AP.
Q: Thank you, Mr. President. I have a question for each of the leaders. They will be brief and -- but related.
President Biden, first for you: How confident should Asia be about a robust American commitment to a nuclear umbrella when the Compa- -- Commander-in-Chief who preceded you and is looking to succeed you spoke openly about reducing the U.S. footprint in the Korean Peninsula?
President Yoon, how much confidence can Japan and the U.S. have about Seoul's long-term commitment to rapprochement when polls show the solid majority of Korea disapproves of your handling and mending of the forced labor issue?
And, Prime Minister Kishida, what assurances can you give to your country's citizens who fear bolstering your security cooperation in this matter could lead to -- the country into an economic cold war with China?
And if you'll indulge me, Mr. President, on a domestic matter: What is your reaction to the Special Counsel appointment last week into your son?
Thank you.
PRESIDENT BIDEN: (Laughs.) Well, first of all, look, there's not much, if anything, I agree on with my predecessor on foreign policy. His America First policy, walking away from the rest of the world, has made us weaker, not stronger.
America is strong with our allies and our alliances, and that's why we will endure. And it's a strength that -- quite frankly, that increases all the -- three of our strengths.
This is just about one summit. What makes today different is it actually launches a series of initiatives that are actually institutional changes in how we deal with one another -- in security cooperation, economic cooperation, technology cooperation, development cooperation, consultation exercises. And all of this will create (inaudible) momentum, I believe, year by year, month by month, to make the relationship stronger and more certain to remain to be in place.
And with regard -- on these esult- -- results, I think you're going to keep it going. And I think you're going to benefit all our countries.
And with regard to the second question, I make -- I have no comment on any investigation that's going on. That's up to the Justice Department, and that's all I have to say.
PRESIDENT YOON: (As interpreted.) To the question that was directed to me, I would like to say that the treaty made between Korea and Japan that was made in 1965 and the following measures by the government and the Supreme Court's ruling in 2015 have some differences. But we have already implemented measures to bridge the gaps among them.
And in South Korea, of course, there is public opinion that is opposed to the government's measures like that. However, from a perspective that's forward-looking, strengthening ties and improving relationships between Korea and Japan are important and there is a shared understanding that this matters to our bilateral relationship, as well as our future. And this is something we need to continue working on.
PRIME MINISTER KISHIDA: (As interpreted.) Thank you for the question. First of all, at today's meeting, the rules-based international order and activities inconsistent to such rule-based international order and activities. Other concerns have been shared, and the rule-based, free and open international order must be defended. And going forward, the U.S., Japan, ROK strategic collaboration will be reinforced even further. Such endeavors will continue going forward.
Our country and for the surrounding countries, the response capabilities, as well as defense capabilities, will be bolstered. And by doing so, the lives and livelihood of our population will be protected and the sense of assurance must be raised. These are the important activities.
Having said that, with regard to China, last year, in November, there was the Japan-China Leaders Summit, and there was a positive momentum. By maintaining the positive momentum, what has to be asserted will be asserted. And we shall strongly request responsible conduct. And we will continue an accumulative conversation about multiple issues. We will cooperate with regard to common challenges. Such constructive and stable relationship will be established by mutual effort.
That is my administration's consistent policy. Based on this perception towards regional stability, our efforts will continue.
Thank you.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: President Yoon, next question, please.
PRESIDENT YOON: (As interpreted.) Please go ahead and ask a question. The reporter from Money Today -- reporter named Jongjin Park. Please go ahead with your question.
Q: (As interpreted.) Hi, I'm Jongjin Park of Money Today. First of all, I would like to ask a question to President Yoon Suk Yeol of the Republic of Korea. I heard that you said that a new chapter has opened in our trilateral cooperation with the two countries. Compared to the previous summits, what would be the most significant outcome that you gained through this summit?
And also, from the perspective of our people, what would be the benefit that the people of Korea would feel from these strengthening of ties?
And now my question goes to President Biden. During this summit, the issues of detainees or prisoners of wars -- and you mentioned that there will be further cooperation in these human rights issues. And you also said you will support the free and peaceful Korean Peninsula in the region. And what kind of shift would there be in your policy? And what kind of specific solutions do you have in this regard?
Lastly, I would like to direct my question to Prime Minister Kishida. Today, we had a historic trilateral summit. However, there was much backlash and many concerns in Korea. However, President Yoon showed his political courage to do so. That's the international community's evaluation.
However, there are still concerns that Japan is making very passive efforts to resolve our issues that still remain. And also, how would you be able to show your truthful willingness to resolve and improve our bilateral relations going forward?
PRESIDENT YOON: (As interpreted.) First of all, this trilateral cooperation amongst our three countries has opened a new chapter, and we made that announcement today to talk about the differences from the past cooperation.
For instance, in the past, it was about individual issues that we sought cooperation among ourselves. But now, as we have opened a new chapter in our cooperation for security, economy, science and technology, and development cooperation for the Global South, health, and women -- across all of these issues, our three countries decided to closely work together. So it's much more comprehensive in nature.
Such comprehensive cooperation has been launched by us today because currently we face complicated crisis and the threat from the DPRK. And across the world, we believe that we can together make a contribution to freedom and peace around the world.
So that is our foundational understanding and our common and shared interests of the three countries. And not just for exclusionary interests of ourselves. Our interests are well aligned with the universal interests of the members of the global community. That's where we find our shared interests lie.
And at the same time, this framework of comprehensive cooperation among our three countries will contribute to global supply chain resilience, global financial market stability, cooperation in the frontier technology sectors and science.
Our three countries together have the best-in-class expertise in science and technology. And we are the ones who are implementing liberal democracies.
Naturally, progress in science and technologies will bring benefits -- tangible benefits to our people, not just in terms of security, but also in terms of economy and science and technology.
But what is most important here is not about our own interests only. When we put our forces together, I believe that we can make a contribution to the advancement of freedom and peace in the world. And that's exactly where our interests are aligned.
PRESIDENT BIDEN: I -- look, back in May of 2022, I met with the families of the Japanese abductees during my visit, heard their stories, and empathized with them and got a sense of the pain they're feeling. It's real.
We know there are many families out there who still wait and worry and wonder. We're not going to forget about them or their loved ones.
And there's clear language on this on our joint statement. The bottom line is this: that we share a common position. We're committed to working together to see the return of all prisoners of war and -- and those who've been abducted and detained.
And by the way, one of the things we get asked many times -- and it wasn't directly asked, but implied -- is what makes us think any of this is positive.
Success brings success. When other nations see cooperation in the region, they make judgments about: Would they be better off if they made commitments? Will they move?
Think about -- as students of history, all of you -- and you are -- think about how many times successes have generated other successes when you don't anticipate it.
And so, I -- I just think this is a -- we're not going to forget, we're not giving up, and we're going to continue to make the case for the freedom of all of those detainees.
PRIME MINISTER KISHIDA: (As interpreted.) With regard to your question for me, first of all, I have strong feelings about strengthening bilateral relationships between the ROK and Japan. I share that with President Yoon. The two countries, in dealing with international challenges, should cooperate. We're both important neighboring countries. And so, friendship with President Yoon and a relationship of trust, based on this, both countries as partners should open up a new era. And that is my thinking.
This year, President Yoon came to Japan, and I visited the ROK. At international fora, we have repeated meetings -- we have had repeated meetings. And between our two countries, including the economy and security, we've had forward-looking and concrete approaches which were started. It's already in motion, dynamically.
Economic security dialogue was started -- or it has been decided on. In the area of export control, there have been progress. And also financial ministers and defense ministers have had meetings.
And so, we've had this very positive, forward-looking developments. And these are seen not only in the public sector. Also in the private sector, we see a slate of developments, human exchanges, and exchanges between business circles. We're seeing very active developments in all of these areas, and that is a reality.
Going forward, we hope to accumulate these approaches along with President Yoon to strengthen our bilateral relations even further. By generating results, we hope that people will understand Japan's feelings towards our bilateral relations. And we'd like to continue such efforts.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Then, let me see. From Kyodo -- Tajiri-san, Kyodo News.
Q: (As interpreted.) Tajiri, Kyodo News. At Camp David with history. I do have a question to each of the leaders.
President Biden, it was mentioned at this summit meeting that Russia's aggression of Ukraine is continuing. So, what role do you expect of Japan?
Prime Minister Kishida has mentioned that as China's threat in Asia is rising, Ukraine may be East Asia tomorrow. What do you think about this comment, President Biden?
And the situation in Asia, where China's threat is rising -- what is the meaning and significance of the trilateral relationship with Japan, U.S., ROK becoming stronger in multiple layers?
President Yoon Suk Yeol, I have a question to Your Excellency. North Korea's nuclear missile development is a major security threat to Japan, South Korea, and the U.S. As North Korea's provocations continue to escalate, what is the meaning and significance of the three countries declaring a new era of partnership?
Regarding the release of treated water at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, did Prime Minister Kishida explain the matter at the trilateral or the bilateral summit today?
To the recent Japan-ROK summit meeting, Your Excellency, you expressed your intent to respect the IAEA report despite the strong domestic opposition. Why do you demonstrate your understanding for the policy of Kishida administration? I ask for that reason.
And to Prime Minister Kishida, this is the first time that a trilateral summit is held on a standalone basis rather than on the sidelines of international meetings. You have said that the trilateral cooperation will be raised to new heights for the security environment in East Asia. And without the resolution of abduction, North Korea is continuing nuclear missile development. What is the meaning for North Korea?
And in eastern South China Seas, by maritime advancement, China is continuing unilateral attempts to change the status quo. What is the meaning for China?
PRESIDENT BIDEN: And you have a great imagination. One question ends up being six. But, thank you. I'll try to answer all of it. (Laughter.) I'm glad I didn't have you as my law professor when he said ""one question."" (Laughs.) At any rate, they're all legitimate questions.
Look, on Ukraine, I and my country and the leadership of my country in both parties are very grateful for everything Japan is helping to deal with in Ukraine. And I mean that sincerely. You've showed strong leadership through the G7 as well and contributed to a significant amount of financial and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, as well as nonlethal military equipment.
And, you know -- and they joined so many other nations in holding Russia accountable through their international sanctions.
If my memory serves me well -- and I think it does, Mr. Prime Minister -- we found ourselves in a circumstance where, when I called you about Ukraine, I didn't have to convince you of anything. I started off to make the case that Ukraine was a circumstance where -- to think, in the first quarter of the 20th century, another country would amass over 150,000 forces on the border of another country -- or 150,000 forces and invade that country -- invade that country without any rationale other than -- if you read Putin's speech after he invaded, he talked about Kyiv being the motherland. You know, I mean, it just was ridiculous, I think. And he talked about being Peter the Great. It was --
Just imagine if we had done nothing. Imagine if we had done nothing.
And the point was immediately recognized, if I'm not mistaken, by you, Mr. Prime Minister, that we're
in a situation where it could happen anywhere. If we stand -- if we had stood still, what signal would that send to China about Taiwan? What signal would that send around the world if nations weren't powerful on borders?
But here's the deal. You contributed significantly to what, I think, is already the --
Let me put it this way. Russia has already lost. It cannot meet its original objective which it stated. It's not possible.
But -- and they've joined so many other nations in holding Russia accountable for international sanctions. But Japan's leadership, from day one, it has been critical for making it clear that the consequences for war extend well beyond Europe -- well beyond Europe.
I say it in reverse. What would happen if an Asian country with 150,000 troops invaded another? You think that would not affect the interests, the economy, and -- and the foreign policy of nations in Europe and Latin America all across the world? It would have profound impact.
And with Japan's leadership, from day one, it has been critical to making clear the consequences of this will extend well beyond Europe -- well beyond Europe. It's a global issue that has impacts everywhere. And the Prime Minister's comments at Shangri La capture that.
And by the way, you know, we talked about this being an inflection point. The world is changing. The world is changing. And about every six or seven generations, it makes significant change. And there's a lot happening.
And the idea that we're going to sit down, the rest of the world, and say, ""Well, that's only a European problem."" There hasn't been that kind of invasion since World War Two.
And so -- as for peace, we all want that, of course. Ukrainians want it most of all. And my team has been working very closely with the -- President Zelenskyy's team and further peace formula, noting that ""nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.""
But nonetheless, we're meeting with them constantly -- constantly.
And your other two questions about China -- I'll just say this: This summit was not about China. That was not the purpose of the meeting. But it did come -- China obviously came up. Not to say we don't share concerns about the economic coercion or heightened tensions caused by China, but this summit was really about our relationship with each other and deepening cooperation across an entire range of issues that went well beyond just the immediate issues we raised.
It was about more peaceful and prosperous Indo-Pacific -- a region, quite frankly, that would benefit everyone living there and around the world if we get it right. It's not just here. It has a phenomenal impact.
Think about what's -- at any rate, I won't get going. I'll take too long.
But as you've seen from the initiatives we're announcing here, today is just how committed we are to see this vision take place. And I think this relationship that we put together and I think we're going to -- you're going to see it expand. It's not merely what we did today. This is a historic meeting.
But we're about to -- we've laid in place a long-term structure for a relationship that will last and have a phenomenal impact not just in Asia, but around the world.
Someone once said in a different context that -- about a health- -- a healthcare provision in my country a while ago: This is a big deal. This is a big deal.
Thank you.
Q: President Biden, how soon do you anticipate meeting with President Xi --
PRESIDENT BIDEN: They have to answer their questions.
PRESIDENT YOON: (As interpreted.) Yes, let me address the questions directed to me.
First, as to North Korea's nuclear and missile provocations and the threats that are posed and how we plan to counter those threats together among our three countries, let me address that question.
Of the cooperative frameworks among our three countries is the most -- what is most symbolic out of those is our cooperation in defense area. Any provocations or attacks against any one of our three countries will trigger a decision-making process of this trilateral framework, and our solidarity will become even stronger and harder.
And at the same time, missile information will be shared in a real-time basis, and systematic training and drills will be implemented in accordance with systematic annual schedules, regular schedules, and regular trainings that we plan to carry out together against the DPRK's missile provocations. That will be our response.
And at the same time, regarding your question concerning the water release from the Fukushima plant, as a matter of fact, that issue was not addressed during our summit because it was not on the agenda.
But still, let me try to address that question. The Fukushima plant's treated water, if it's going to have some type of impact, it would flow through the entire Pacific Ocean having an impact not just on our three countries, but all countries around the world.
As such, for the sake of safety and health of the people of our three countries and all members of the international community, that should be something that we need to place the highest priority on.
Regarding this treated water, based on scientific principles, all of the processing should be carried out accordingly. And at the same time, internationally recognized and reliable IAEA's investigation results are something that we can trust.
And I would like to make sure that everything is conducted and carried out in accordance with the procedures established by the IAEA. Together with the international community and also together with the Koreans, transparent data disclosure would be necessary, in my opinion.
PRIME MINISTER KISHIDA: (As interpreted.) Thank you. The question to myself. As you mentioned, nuclear and missile development by North Korea or unilateral attempts to change the status quo in the East and South China Seas are ongoing. And the security environment surrounding our three countries, it has becoming increasingly harsh day after day.
Under this backdrop, on this occasion, we agreed to enhance the coordination between the U.S.-Japan and the U.S.-ROK alliances and to bring the trilateral security cooperation to new heights.
This is indeed the requirement of this era. And by this summit, I am sure that the trilateral security cooperation will further advance and reinforce the regional peace and stability.
In particular, with regard to North Korea, we were able to put forward concrete results, such as the implementation of annual Japan, U.S, ROK multidomain and joint exercises and the establishment of a working group to address North Korea's cyber activities.
I also stated that the abduction issue is a humanitarian issue with time constraints. And Joe and President Yoon reiterated their strong support for the immediate resolution of this matter.
We also shared our recognition that the path to dialogue with North Korea is open.
Furthermore, once again, the presidents of both countries aligned with me in strongly opposing unilateral changes to the status quo through the use of force.
We will continue our efforts to further strengthen the strategic partnership among the three countries in order to defend the free, open, and international order based on the rule of law.
That is all. Thank you.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: This concludes --
PRESIDENT BIDEN: To answer your question, I expect and hope to follow up on our conversation on Bali this fall. That's my expectation. Thank you.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: This concludes our press conference. Please -- please stay seated as the -- the leaders depart, please. Please stay seated.
Q: Mr. President, are you winning the competition with China?
PRESIDENT BIDEN: We're winning all the competition.

2023-08-18 00:00:00,"Remarks Prior to a Meeting with President Yoon Suk Yeol of the Republic of Korea and Prime Minister Kishida Fumio of Japan at Camp David, Maryland","
PRESIDENT BIDEN: Well, welcome, everyone. Mr. Prime Minister, Mr. President, it's an honor to welcome you both here today to inaugurate the Camp David trilateral between our three nations -- among our three nations.
It's not only the first summit I've hosted at Camp David, it's the first-ever standalone summit between the leaders of Japan and Republic of Korea and the United States.
And I can think of no better way -- no better way to mark our new chapter of our trilateral cooperation than meeting here at Camp David.
And so, strengthening the ties between our democracies has long been a priority for me, dating back to when I was vice president of the United States. That's because our countries are stronger and the world is safer -- let me say that again --our countries are stronger and the world will be safer as we stand together. And I know this is a belief we all three share.
And I want to thank you both for your political courage that brought you here. And I'm looking forward to us having a great meeting, but continuing these meetings.
You've stepped up to do the hard work -- the, I would argue, historic work -- to forge a foundation from which we can face the future together -- the three of us together.
And I'm deeply grateful for your leadership, and I look forward to working with both of you as we begin this new era of cooperation and renew our resolve to serve as a force of good across the Indo-Pacific and, quite frankly, around the world as well.
President Yoon, let me turn this over to you.
PRESIDENT YOON: (As interpreted.) I would like to extend my gratitude to President Biden for his warm hospitality. Last July, we met in Vilnius for the NATO Summit, and I'm pleased to be reunited in about a month.
At this symbolic venue of Camp David in the history of modern diplomacy, our trilateral partnership is opening a new chapter, which carries great significance, in my view.
President Roosevelt once stated: Freedom is not a given but something you fight to win. To make sure that each of our freedoms is neither threatened or damaged, our three nations must tighten our solidarity. Such is also our promise and mandate towards our future generations.
The stronger coordination between Korea, the U.S., and Japan requires more robust institutional foundations. Moreover, challenges that threaten regional security must be addressed by us building a stronger commitment to working together.
Today will be remembered as a historic day where we established a firm institutional basis and commitments to the trilateral partnership.
Today, I hope we will explore together ways to elevate cooperation between Korea, the U.S., and Japan to a new plane through in-depth discussions.
PRIME MINISTER KISHIDA: (As interpreted.) First of all, I would like to express my sympathy once again for the devastating damages caused by the wildfires in Maui, Hawaii. In order to provide relief to the affected people, Japan has decided to offer a total of around $2 million of support. I offer my heartfelt prayer for the earliest possible recovery of the affected areas.
May I also once again convey my heartfelt condolences for the passing away of President Yoon's father.
And now I would like to thank Joe for your kind invitation to the two of us to Camp David, a place with history.
President Yoon, I have been meeting you almost on a monthly basis since March of this year. But the fact that we -- the three leaders have got together in this way, I believe, means that we are indeed making a new history as of today.
The international community is at a turning point in history. In order to allow the potential of our trilateral strategic collaboration to bloom and to blossom, I wish to take this moment to raise the security -- the coordination between Japan, ROK, and the U.S. to new heights while strengthening the coordination between the Japan-U.S. and the U.S.-ROK alliances as we deepen our cooperation in the response to North Korea.
I wish to expand and deepen our collaboration in extensive areas, including economic security, such as critical and emergent technology, cooperation, and supply chains resilience.
Today, I look forward to engaging in frank discussions amongst ourselves in order to declare a new area of Japan, U.S., ROK partnership.
I once again express my gratitude for Joe's initiative. Thank you.
PRESIDENT BIDEN: Thank you. We politely ask the press to -- to leave. Thank you for coming in.

2023-08-17 00:00:00,"Remarks in an Exchange with Reporters in Avoca, Pennsylvania","
THE PRESIDENT: I'm just going to make a brief comment about my friend, Ellen Casey. You know, she -- I don't know if -- some of you Scrantonians may have known her. But she loved with a fierceness and a tenderness that was incredible. And it was the Irish of her. She just was incredible.
And I was saying earlier that -- my sister and I were talking about her. And my sister reminded me of a quote about Michelangelo. It said: He saw the angel in the marble and carved until he set it free. That's what she did with everybody. I mean, she really did, if you're knew her.
I know this sounds like an exaggeration, but I've been coming back home since -- I've never left, actually. And I've known the Caseys for the bulk of my life. I don't remember when I didn't know the Ca- -- the Caseys.
And Bobby's dad was older than me, then I am older than Bobby. And we lived not far from one another. He was on Wyoming Avenue, and I lived on North Washington Avenue. We went to the same parish, St. Paul's.
And anyway, just a -- she's an incredible woman. And she raised an enormously successful and decent family. All the values I learned, I learned them here in Scranton. And she was an embodiment of them.
So, I -- the reason I am not going to the funeral tomorrow is everyone would have to be wanded to go in -- that I'd -- I'd mess everything up if I went.
But in addition to that, I have to meet with -- at Camp David with two world leaders tomorrow morning.
But in addition, I didn't come -- I'm not going to stay at the viewing when the people are coming in. But, again, they have to be wanded; I just become an impediment.
I just want to show my respect to the family. So --
Q: Can you tell us about your Hawaii trip, sir?
THE PRESIDENT: No, not now. I'm going to be leaving, and I'll be there on Monday.
Q: Why is it important that you go?
Q: Sir, do you think --
THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.

THE PRESIDENT: I'll speak about one thing: Mrs. Casey. Nothing else.
Q: Okay.
THE PRESIDENT: Do you have a question about Casey?
Q: Yes. What was her role in -- in your life?
THE PRESIDENT: She played an enormous role, not just in my life but everyone's.
You know, there's a quote my sister always uses about Michelangelo. It says: He saw the angel in the marble, and he carved and he set it free. That's who she was. She was an incredible woman -- decent, honorable. Her values were amazing.
And every time I would go to Scranton over the years, I would stop and see her. She was a friend.
Anyway, I'm going up or I'm going to be late for Bobby.
Q: Will you come talk to us about Hawaii?
Q: On the Camp David summit, are you willing to share what your goals are for the summit, sir?

2023-08-16 00:00:00,Remarks on the Anniversary of the Inflation Reduction Act,"
THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Scott. (Applause.) Thank you, thank you, thank you. (Applause.) Please, thank you.
I think your patience today exceeds your good judgment, but thank you. (Laughter.)
And I want to say one thing to your children: I know some really great ice cream places around here -- (laughter) -- and Daddy owes you. Okay? (Laughter.) So, talk to me afterwards.
Folks, thanks for the introduction. And, Scott, thank you very much.
You know, I want to thank Vice President Harris; members of the Cabinet -- Secretary Vilsack, Administrator Regan; you know, members of Congress, and particularly Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, who played such a pivotal role in getting this bill done.
Everyone was telling us there is no possibility with the divided Congress -- the way it was -- that we could get it done. And you got it done without a single vote on the other team, although that began to change at the end.
And all the special guests, state and local leaders, business leaders, entrepreneurs, advocates.
You know, one year ago, with your leadership, I signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law and -- one of the most significant laws I think has ever been enacted -- taking on the special interests and winning -- and winning. (Applause.)
Delivering -- delivering on promises that have long been made to the American people to lower costs for families, especially healthcare costs, increase America's energy security, restore fairness to a tax code, create good-paying jobs here in America, and to address the existential threat of climate crisis.
You know, it's part of a much broader vision for our country: growing the economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down.
I'm a capitalist. I think if you can go make a billion dollars, go make it. I'm all for that. Just pay your taxes. (Laughter.)
But because when the middle class does well -- all kidding aside -- everybody does well. Everybody. The poor have a ladder up. The middle class are -- have a good shot. And -- and -- and the wealthy do very well.
The Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal initially called my plan ""Bidenomics."" I'm not sure they meant it in a totally complimentary way at the time. (Laughter.) But guess what? It's working. (Applause.)
Our economic plan -- made possible by all of you in this room, and that's not hyperbole -- created more than 13 million 400 thousand jobs -- new jobs since I took office. Nearly 800 -- (applause) -- nearly 800,000 manufacturing jobs.
Where is it written that America can't create the most vibrant and innovative economy and be the world's leading manufacturer again? Where is that written? I didn't see that anywhere.
We've created more jobs in two years than any administration has in a single four-year term. And I'm very proud -- (applause) -- and I'm very proud that unemployment has been below 4 percent for the longest stretch in over 50 years. (Applause.) Below 4 percent and going down.
We now have more jobs than we did before the pandemic. And workers aren't just finding more jobs, they're finding better jobs, higher pay, higher job satisfaction. And unemployment is down and so is inflation.
Remember what the experts told us, okay? And they're traditional economists, very smart women and men. They told us getting inflation under control, in order to do it, we had to lower wages and increase unemployment. Not a joke. Had to lower wages and increase unemployment.
But we never, never, never thought the problem was too many people -- I -- at least, I didn't -- too many people that were working or that working people were making too much money. I just thought that was not the best answer to how to get it down.
Now, one reason we've seen inflation fall by two thirds without losing jobs is corporate profits are coming back down to earth. The excesses are being eliminated by the corporations.
We have more to do, but inflation is now at the lowest point it's been in two years.
When the Inflation Reduction Act was passed a year ago today, inflation was -- as pointed out by Chuck or Nancy; I can't remember which one -- 8.3 percent. It's now down to 3.2 percent -- (applause) -- the lowest amount -- and it's going to go lower.
But here's the point: It's lowest among the world's leading economies. Take every major economy in the world. We have the lowest uninflat- -- inflation rate.
At the same time, wages are growing faster than inflation, and this matters.
The way I think about inflation is the way my dad used to talk about it around the kitchen table. Not a joke. I'm being deadly earnest about this. He'd ask, ""How much is left after all the monthly bills are paid? How much do you have left over after you pay them all? And is there -- at the end of the month, just to have a little bit of breathing room. Just a little bit of breathing room.""
That's one of the reasons why we've worked so hard dealing with Pharma and other things. Not only do you get the overall cost of average people and the monthly bills down, in addition to inflation, the Inflation Reduction Act is giving people more breathing room, as my dad would say. And it's supercharging the economic transition in key ways.
First, it's taking the most aggressive action ever on climate energy -- ever. I've long said -- and I've -- that's why I think all the unions have come along. I've long said: When I think climate -- not a joke -- I think jobs. I think jobs. (Applause.) For real.
And, by the way, none of this would have happened had the unions not stepped up and supported us. The idea -- (applause) -- they wouldn't have. It would not have happened.
This law is one of the biggest drivers of jobs and economic growth this country has ever seen.
Since I took office, the private sector has announced nearly 400 -- excuse me -- $240 billion in new clean energy manufacturing investments. That's private sector -- $240 billion investment. (Applause.)
And the law has already created an estimated 170,000 clean energy jobs in one year. It's estimated that it will -- it will -- that will grow to 1.5 million more jobs over the next decade. First, it was one year. Now we're talking about the decade.
You know, just don't take it from me. The CEO of U.S. Steel called the Inflation Reduction Act ""Manufacturing"" -- he called it the ""Manufacturing Renaissance Act"" because it's bringing jobs back to America, manufacturing here in America. Made in America.
According to leading Wall Street firms Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, my broader investment -- our broader investment in Investing in America agenda is unleashing a boom -- a boom of manufacturing investments.
And we're leaving nobody behind. We're investing in all of America: in the Heartland and coast to coast.
You know, I saw some of our -- a few of my Democratic friends -- not in Congress -- but friends said, ""Look, you're -- you're investing more in red states than in blue states."" Well, I made a commitment. This is about all of America. I was the Pre- -- (applause) -- no, I really mean it.
And we've seen progress across the country, from Maine to South Carolina, to Minnesota, to New Mexico. The Vice President and I and the Cabinet have seen progress across the country.
Just yesterday, I was in Wisconsin at a -- at a company that makes clean energy equipment, including wind turbines. Because of the Inflation Reduction Act, they expect their market in American-made wind turbine generators to double next year.
And, by the way, the guy who was the most ardent opponent of all this was talking about what great benefits are coming to Wisconsin. (Laughter.)
Bless me, Father. I have -- (laughter). I'm going to be a good boy. (Laughter.) I'm going to keep the Irish in me down a little bit here. (Laughter.)
At the same time, we're also boosting our nation's energy security. For years, China dominated the clean energy supply chains. We became -- we let the American jobs and factories go overseas. For how long have we gone through this period where the answer for the previous -- mostly in Republican, but some Democratic administrations -- the answer had been: Find the cheapest labor in the world; go -- close the factory here, build it over there, wherever that is; and then import the product from abroad?
Not anymore. We are building it here and sending the product over there. (Applause.) No, I mean it.
We're bringing -- we're bringing critical supply chains and technologies home for electric vehicle batteries, solar panels, wind turbines, critical minerals.
And because of the CHIPS and Science Act, we've generated $231 billion in private investment, in making semiconductors -- $231 billion. A small -- that small computer chip, the size of the end of your -- your fingertip that affects nearly everything in our lives, from cellphones, to automobiles, to the most sophisticated weapons systems.
You know, we invented these chips. We used to produce these chips. We stopped. And we saw it during the pandemic -- we paid a high price for things that went overseas. Factories shut down; we paid a big price. But now we're bringing semiconductors home.
In 2030, the Inflation Reduction Act is projected to help triple wind power and increase solar power by eightfold. By 2030, electric -- electrically deployed -- excuse me, electricity deployed through the U.S. power grid is expected to be powered by 81 percent clean energy. Do you hear me? Eighty-one percent clean energy. (Applause.)
Imagine the impact on climate and the air we breathe. The law is going to help meet all of my bold climate goals by cutting carbon pollution in half by 2030 -- in half by 2030. (Applause.)
And between the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we're investing more than $50 billion to build up resilience in impacts on climate change.
These laws support important priorities, from addressing historic drought along the Colorado River Basin. Remember when I said we had a concern about the Colorado River literally going dry? You all thought I was crazy. I wish I had been. But guess what? I was just out there and looking down on the Grand Canyon. And guess what? It's coming back.
But any rate, we're responding to coastal erosion, sea level rise in the Gulf of Mexico, and helping reduce the effects of extreme heat by investing nearly $1.5 billion to plant trees and expand community parks and forests.
Folks, there's a lot more, and you've heard a lot today, and I'm going to not go into it all. But this law is helping mem- -- families save thousands of dollars on energy bills every year through the tax credit and rebates to buy new and efficient electric appliances, weatherize their homes, install heat pumps, rooftop solar.
As a consequence of this, it's estimated that the consumer is going to save at least $27 billion in electric bills between now and 2030. (Applause.)
We're also offering tax credits up to $7,500 to buy new electric vehicles -- and I've worked it out with the European Union -- (laughter) -- and fuel cells made here in America.
For the first time, we can get a tax credit to buy used electric vehicles. And thanks to the law, new electric vehicles are going to save -- this is -- this is a fact, if we do this -- and we're doing it now -- tens of billions of gallons of gasoline between now and 2030. That's a lot less pollution. (Applause.)
And I'm not even going to start to talk to you about Amtrak. (Laughter.) It's going to save billions of dollars -- and I really mean it -- in energy costs. But we'll get into that later. (Laughter.)
Let me be clear on this point: When I say climate means jobs, I mean good-paying union jobs. (Applause.)
And the law -- and the law will give an added boost to clean energy products that pay a prevailing wage, employ registered apprenticeships, and use made-in-America parts and products, and not violate any international trade agreements. It's all in the law.
And we're rein- -- we're reincentivizing companies to build clean energy projects in the same communities that powered our nation with fossil fuels. We owe them -- whether it was Scranton, Pennsylvania, or West Virginia or wherever it has been. The fos- -- they've -- they've supplied the fossil fuels we needed for generations.
For example, next generation batteries are being made in an old steel mill in West Virginia. Solar panels are going to be -- to go -- going to a closed coal plant in New Mexico.
These incentives are going to help make clean energy jobs good-paying union jobs and ensure the benefits of clean energy economy reaching communities left behind. And they're left behind -- when they left behind, they lost their pride. They lost a sense of who they were. They lost what was going on. To reach communities too often left behind -- and that's the focus.
And we're already seeing it happen. Laborers and carpenters are building solar farms. Iron workers and operating engineers building wind projects. Electricians installing solar panels and electric vehicle chargers. By the way, 500,000 of those suckers. And it's going to mean a lot. And it's a big deal.
The clean energy economy should also be a win-win for auto companies and union workers. You know, as the Big Three automakers and companies -- the United Auto Workers negotiated a new collective bargaining agreement, I'm asking him to work together to forge a fair agreement.
Together -- together, we can make this transition to a clean energy future fair and just. And that means ensuring that auto jobs continue to be good jobs that can su- -- you can support a family on. (Applause.)
But auto companies honor the right of workers to organize, taking every possible step to avoid painful plant closings. And that when transitions are needed, they are fair and designed to retool, reboot, and rehire the same -- in the same factory and communities at a competitive wage while the existing workers get the first shot to fill those jobs. That's only fair. It matters.
Second, because the Inflation Reduction Act, we're -- we're -- we're talking about lifesaving steps to reduce healthcare costs. It locks in place the lower healthcare premiums for millions of American families under the Affordable Care Act, saving them an average of $800 a year.
And I see my friends in the Congress who saw that -- in the Senate and House who saw that -- make that happen.
Plus, we pay more for our prescription drugs than any country -- major country in the world. The cu- -- the product made here in the United States sold in Montreal or Paris or anywhere around the world is cheaper than it's made here, where it was -- where it's been produced.
For years, many of us have been trying to give Medicare the power to negotiate lower drug prices, which would reduce, by the way, the federal deficit at the same time. Because when Medicare doesn't have to pay the high price, guess what? It cuts your taxes. It cuts the amount of money that the federal government has to pay.
For years, Big Pharma won. Big Pharma blocked us. But not this time. (Applause.)
I know I don't look it, but I've been arou- -- I've been around for 400 years. (Laughter.) And I've been fighting Pharma on this since the 1970s. No, not a joke.
This time, we finally beat Big Pharma. Medicare finally has the power to negotiate lower prescription drug prices, like the Department of Veterans Affairs has -- had the power.
That's not all. We've heard -- you've heard -- this was already spoken to: insulin. Companies pay -- it costs -- and, by the way, the guy who invented the insulin, he never patented it because he wanted it available for everybody. It never was patented.
And guess what? It costs 10 bucks to make. And if you use everything including packaging, it could be as high as 12 and a half dollars. Now those companies are charging 30 times that amount.
Now seniors on Medicare -- and, by the way, it should be beyond seniors and Medicare, but I'll come back to that at another time -- were paying as much as $400 a month for insulin. And they're now just paying 35 bucks a month.
We're also capping total out-of-pocket expense for drugs for seniors on Medicare to $2,200 a year -- $2,000 a year for even the expensive cancer drugs that could cost as much as $10-, $12-, $14,000 a year. Combine all the costs of their drugs, by 2025, they'll never have to pay more than a total of $2,000 after 2025. (Applause.)
One -- one in three -- one in three seniors on Medicare is going to save an average of $400 a year. Seniors with the highest drug costs are going to save an average of $2,500 a year. And the Pharma companies are still going to do very, very well.
The laws require that drug companies will raise prices faster than inflation. If they do that, they're going to have to pay the difference back to Medicare. That'll create an incentive to keep prices from skyrocketing. And negotiating drug prices alongside other parts of the law will save the federal government $160 billon -- reducing the cost of government by $160 billion.
It will lower the federal deficit because it means -- what happens here is Medicare is going to be paying less for the prescription drugs they deliver to the American people. So, it not only lowers cost for the -- for the person receiving the drug, it lowers the cost for taxpayers -- lowers the cost for taxpayers.
And it gets to a third win for the American people with this law: We've made all the progress without raising taxes on the middle class.
I made a commitment -- and some thought it was too -- too much of a commitment; it's too high -- that no one making less than $400,000 a year will pay a single penny more in federal taxes. It's a commitment I've kept so far. And as long as I'm president, I will keep it.
Unlike the last president, in my first two years in office, we actually cut the federal debt -- deficit by $1.7 trillion. You hear me? The first two years -- we cut the debt [deficit] by $1.7 trillion. (Applause.)
And through this law, we're going to continue cutting the deficit and cutting subsidies to Big Pharma and ensuring the wealthy and big corporations begin to pay their fair share of federal taxes.
Does anyone here think that the tax system is fair? In 2020 -- you remember, I was a pain in the neck about this; I know -- there were 55 of the largest corporations in America who paid zero in federal taxes -- 55 of the 500 -- of the Fortune 500. And they made $40 billion in profit. Didn't pay a penny.
Not anymore. The law requires a minimum tax of 15 percent on our biggest corporations and a 1 percent excise tax on stock buybacks when they pay profits to shareholders.
The law also saves money by cracking down on super-wealthy tax cheats, making sure billionaires -- who pay -- by the way, there's about a thousand now. We used to have 750 before the pandemic. By the way, if you're going to be a billionaire -- not a problem. I'm -- I'm a capitalist. I also was listed for 36 years the poorest man in the Senate, but that's a different issue. (Laughter.) But billionaires and the biggest corporations should at least pay the taxes they owe.
Do you know what the average tax on a billionaire in America is today -- federal tax? 8.2 percent.
You know, a janitor makes -- pays a higher tax than that.
Folks, this law is transformative. And it feel -- you know, it fell entirely to Democrats to deliver it. I hope we've seen -- with all the people out there claiming the credit for it -- they've decided that we're going to -- they're going to join the fight. They're going to join the fight.
I took a -- I guess I shouldn't get into that. (Laughter.) But one congressperson, who has been particularly strident about me, laid out all that we did. We just took it and used it as an ad. (Laughter and applause.) You think I'm kidding.
Look, the idea that not one single Republican voted for it -- you know, I -- and I know my colleagues know this, and I -- I've had seven of my Repub- -- former Republican colleagues in the Senate come to me and say they agreed with us. And -- but I promised I'd never say their names, and I never will tell anybody. But the reason they did that was -- they said, ""Joe, if I vote for X, Y, or Z, it's going to -- they're going to primary, and it will cost me my election.""
Not a lot of political courage, but an explanation as to why there's a lot of people who believe what we're doing is right, but just -- they're a little worried in this environment.
In fact, Republicans have repeatedly tried to repeal key parts of the Inflation Reduction Act, including the Speaker of the House now -- taking credit for the billions of dollars in private investments and thousands of jobs coming into their states.
That's okay. I ran for president, and I said I would represent all Americans. And like I said at the State of the Union, ""I'll see you at the groundbreaking."" (Laughter.) You think I'm kidding. (Laughter.) You know I'm not.
Let me close with this. I'm not here to declare victory on the economy. Our economy is stronger and better than any industrial nation in the world right now. We -- but we have more work to do. We have a plan that's running -- turning things around. The Inflation Reduction Act is a part of that plan.
Bidenomics is just another way of saying ""restoring the American Dream.""
I believe every American willing to work hard -- and I mean this from the bottom my heart. My dad used to say, ""Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck."" I give you my word. ""A lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay,' and mean it.""
Any re- -- any person willing to work hard should be able to get a job no matter where they live, raise their kids on a good paycheck, and keep their roots where they grew up.
How many of you from Midwestern states and border states have found yourself in a position where -- they provide a good education, and you got a -- the son or daughter comes to you, ""Mom, Dad, I've got to move."" When you were governor of Iowa, how many times did you hear that? You have one of the best education systems in the country. ""But I've got to move, Mom. There's no job for me.""
Bidenomics is anchors -- anchored in what's always worked best for the country: investing in America, investing in Americans. Because when we invest in ourselves, when we strengthen the middle class, we see stronger economic growth. It benefits everybody.
Look, folks, I'm proud of the historic law my administration has passed, but it's not about me, and I mean that from the bottom of my heart. It's about you -- all of you in this room, particularly, but the American people. Folks like the ones standing behind me here today.
The most important thing I want to say today is: Thank you, America. Thank you, Americans.
We've faced some tough times in recent years. But you, the American people, didn't give up. You're the ones getting up every single day going to work. You're the ones taking the risks, opening the doors, hiring workers, fulfilling dreams.
And all we hear from our friends on the other side of the aisle is what they claim is what's wrong with America.
Well, let me tell you -- let -- let me tell you: They're telling us America is failing -- failing? They're dead wrong. They're dead wrong. America isn't failing; America is winning.
And I've said it a thousand times -- (applause) -- I've said it a thousand times -- a thousand times: There is no quit in America.
Name me a single objective we've ever set out to accomplish that we failed on. Name me one in all of our history. Not one.
It's never been a good bet to bet against America, and it's still not a good bet today. This is still a country that believes in honesty, decency, and integrity. We're still a country that believes in hard work.
We're still a country that believes that each and every one of us is created equal. We've never fully lived up to it, but we never walked away from it.
And I guarantee you we're still the beacon for the world. You ought to come with me to all these international meetings. Listen to the rest of the world -- what they say to the President of the United States.
Everyday, ordinary people every day get up and do extraordinary things. That's who we are.
America's best days aren't behind us; they're ahead of us. This isn't about the past. It's about the future we're going to build. And I've never been more optimistic about America's future.
Just remember who in God's name we are. We're the United States of America. And there's nothing, nothing, nothing beyond our capacity when we do it together. (Applause.)
God bless you all. And may God protect our troops.
Thank you, thank you, thank you. (Applause.)

Joseph R. Biden, Remarks on the Anniversary of the Inflation Reduction Act Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/364018 "
2023-08-15 00:00:00,"Remarks in Milwaukee, Wisconsin","
THE PRESIDENT: Hello, Milwaukee! Please have a seat if you have one. (Applause.)
Please have a seat if you -- if you have one. (Laughs.) I said that once earlier in my presidency, and there were no chairs. I couldn't see anyth- -- the press wrote, ""Biden doesn't even know whether people can stand or sit."" (Laughter.)
Anyway, it's great to be here.
Thank you, Valentino, for that introduction. And -- and what you said about the union -- you know, I've said it many times: The middle class built America, but unions built the middle class. And that's a fact. (Applause.)
Governor Evers, Mayor Johnson, County Executive Crowley, thank you all for your warm welcome.
And, Tammy Baldwin, you're the best, kid. You're the absolute best. (Laughter.) If I had another 10 of you, we could rule the world. You'd really -- thank you for all you do, Tammy. Appreciate it very much. And, you know, no one does a -- no one does more to create good jobs in this state and make sure tomorrow's products are made in America.
Now a very quiet, laidback congresswoman -- (laughter) -- who, thank God, is on my side -- (laughter) -- thank God -- Gwen Moore. She never stopped fighting for the people of Wisconsin. (Applause.) I love you, Gwen. You're the best.
And you got two -- you got a mayor and a county executive. I used to work for the county. I was -- used to be a county councilman when I was 26 years old. And I tell you what, I ran for the Senate because it's too damn hard being on the county council. (Laughter.) Everybody comes up to you and goes, ""Yeah, county -- county council. Yeah. Um, uh"" ""You wonder what we do, huh?"" Well, the truth of the matter is: They do a hell of a lot. And your mayor is doing a hell of a job as well. (Applause.)
Look, folks, I apologize, because I try very hard to keep my speeches between 15 and 18 minutes, but I got to talk a little bit about Hawaii.
I've often been on the phone with the governor -- coming up here -- and the senators. And -- and let me say -- address that devasting wildfires, some of which are still burning, in Hawaii.
They've claimed the lives of 99 people so far, and they haven't cleaned things up yet. The deadliest wildfire in more than 100 years. A whole city destroyed. Generations of Native Hawaiian history turned into ruin.
I've spoken with Governor Josh Green multiple times and reassured him the state will have everything it needs from the federal government.
I immediately approved the governor's request for an expedited major disaster declaration. That's a fancy word of saying, ""Whatever you need, you're going to get."" And that will get aid into the hands of people who desperately need it -- who have lost their loved ones; who have lost their homes, their livelihoods; who have been damaged and destroyed.
And think about this: All that area they got to plow up, they can't do it now because they don't know how many bodies are there. They don't know what's left.
Imagine being a mom or dad, wondering where your child is. Imagine being a husband or wife or mother or father. It's really tough stuff.
Almost 500 federal personnel have been deployed to Maui to help communities and survivors get back on their feet.
FEMA search and rescue teams are sifting through the ashes in that five-mile area that you've seen on television that's been burned. It's painstaking work. It takes time. It's nerve racking. Most of the debris can't be removed until it's done.
My wife, Jill, and I are going to travel to Hawaii as soon as we can. That's what I've been talking with the governor about. I don't want to get in the way -- I've been to too many disaster areas -- but I want to go and make sure we got everything they need. I want to be sure we don't disrupt the ongoing recovery efforts.
FEMA Administrator Griswell [Criswell] -- who's the best we ever had, I think -- was on the ground this weekend. I just talked to her. She's back in the States. I have directed her to streamline the process as quickly as possible to help register survivors for immediate federal assistance without delay.
To date, FEMA has approved [provided] five tho- -- 50,000 meals; seventy-five liters -- thousand liters of water; 500 [5,000] beds; 10,000 blankets; and -- as well as other shelter supplies for survivors displaced in -- from their homes.
FEMA also authorized one-time payments of $700 per household to folks who have been displaced so they can do the immediate things of just taking care of medications and prescriptions that they so badly need.
We're working with the state to make sure survivors that have lost their homes have a place to call home until we can rebuild.
We're also surging federal personnel to the state to help the brave firefighters and first responders, many of whom lost their own homes, their properties while they're out busting their neck to save other people. How many have so -- been so impacted themselves? But they're still working around the clock to put the fires out, evacuate survivors to safety, and find the missing.
I have ordered all available federal assets on the island to assist local crews, including the U.S. Coast Guard, the Navy Third Fleet, and the U.S. Army.
In the immediate aftermath, the Coast Guard and Navy supported maritime searches and rescue operations. The Army helicopters helped fire suppression and efforts on the Big Island -- because there's still some burning on the Big Island, not the one that is -- not the one where you -- you see on television all the time. FEMA has deployed more than 140 Urban Search and Rescue personnel as well.
And there are so many organizations to thank, like the American Red Cross, helping survivors missing loved ones. Cellphone providers are making sure first responders can make and respond to emergency calls. Commercial airlines that have evacuated tens of thousands of people from the island.
The list goes on.
And the Small Business Administration has dozens of staff on the island and has begun making low-interest federal disaster loans available to Hawaii -- Hawaii businesses, homeowners and renters, and non-profits to help them begin to rebuild -- just to get by for the immediate near term.
And we're going to coordinate and continue to coordinate relentlessly with the people on the ground to make sure the critical work continues.
In the meantime -- you always hear this phrase; and I've been to so many disasters in my career, it's almost hollow -- our prayers -- our thoughts and prayers are with the people of Hawaii. But not just our prayers. Every asset -- every asset they need will be there for them. And we be -- we'll be there in Maui as long as it takes. As long as it takes. And I meant that sincerely.
We're going to have more to report on this.
But today, I come to Milwaukee to talk about what we're doing to bring manufacturing back home. It's about our progress building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down. You know, when we -- it's that trickle-down economics. Not a hell of a lot landed on my dad's kitchen table. But when the middle works and the bottom has a shot up, the wealthy do very well.
I'm a capitalist. If you can make a billion dollars, go make it. I mean it. Just pay a little more taxes than you're paying right not. Eight percent doesn't quite get it. (Applause.)
But, look, I came to office determined to move away from the trickle-down economics and to focus on the middle class. Because I said when the middle class does well, everybody does well -- everybody does well.
The Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal started calling my plan -- not initially as a compliment -- ""Bidenomics.""
But guess what, folks? They're talking about it differently now. It's working. It's working -- (applause) --
I'm serious -- because we're investing in America.
According to Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, my plan is leading to a boom -- they called it a boom -- in manufacturing and manufacturing investment, as you've seen right here in this factory: over 13.4 million new jobs, 150,000 new jobs in the state of Wisconsin. (Applause.) Nearly 800,000 new manufacturing jobs nationwide. More than 20,000 manufacturing jobs in Wisconsin, from Green Bay to Verona to Pleasant Prairie. (Applause.)
We've added more jobs in two years than any president has in American history in a four-year term. More in two than any has done in four. (Applause.)
And unemployment has been below 4 percent for the longest stretch in over 50 years -- 50 years.
Wisconsin's unemployment rate is just 2.5 percent. That's lower than it was every single month the prior administration. (Applause.)
We've recovered all the jobs lost during the pandemic, and we've added millions more. People are coming off the sidelines and getting back into the workplace.
Remember, a while there, they were saying, ""Well, Biden is just allowing people not to work and get paid."" Guess what? A higher percentage of American workers are working today than ever before. (Applause.)
And while unemployment is down, in case you haven't noticed, inflation is down, too, and it's going lower. (Applause.)
Rememeber -- remember what the experts said? To get inflation under control, you needed lower wages and higher unemployment. Not a joke. Those of you who are economists know that's the economic mantra: To get inflation under control, fewer jobs, more unemployment. That's number one. And making sure that you don't have to deal with -- that's what they say caused the inflation.
But I never thought the problem was too many people working or working people making too much money. And one reason we've seen inflation fall by two thirds without losing jobs is that we're seeing corporate profits come back to -- down to earth.
You know, we've done more -- we've done -- we have more to do with inflation, though. It's just about 3 percent now, and it's predicted to go lower than that. We're near the lowest point in over 2 years.
And at the same time, the pay for low-wage workers has grown at the fastest rate in two decades. Wages are growing faster than inflation.
Folks, that's Bidenomics. It's about growing an economy by strengthening the middle class -- (applause) -- and making things in America again.
You know, it's in stark contrast to the conservative Republican view -- the so-called MAGA view -- which is focused on corporate profits. They say we should find that -- the rationale up to now has been: Let's find the cheapest place in the world to make our product. Let's shut down the corpo- -- the -- the operation in America and send it overseas, and then send the refined product back to America and sell it here.
That's their philosophy. But you know who believes that? Your significant senator, Ron Johnson.
He believes outsourcing manufacturing jobs is a great thing. He's on record as saying he doesn't agree with American work- -- this is what he said: American workers should manufacture -- he doesn't think they should manufacture products that require a lot of labor. Here's what he said, quote, ""Let the billions of people around the world do that."" End of quote.
You wonder why the hell we got ourselves in trouble. (Laughter.)
Well, we've been letting them do that for too damn long. It's time to build American products in America. (Applause.)
You can see how Ron Johnson's rationale and the MAGA rationale worked out. Between the year 2000 and January 2021, Wisconsin alone lost more than 136,000 manufacturing jobs alone.
I'd like to see Senator Johnson talk about those -- to talk to those 136,000 people and tell them it doesn't matter whether you manufacture things at home or overseas.
It sure as hell does, man. (Applause.) Not only for those 136,000 people who lost their jobs, but for their families and the communities and the economic growth it generated here at home.
Let's take a look at how the Johnson philosophy played out -- the real time in Wisconsin, like in Kenosha, about 40 miles from here. There used to be a lot of people assembling automobiles there, making a direct [decent] living for their families, generating economic growth for Kenosha, until the American Motors plant closed in '88.
Or take a look at Milwaukee, known as the manufacturing powerhouse for so long. That's -- when I got to the Senate, I -- I've been around about 200 years. (Laughter.) When I got to the Senate in 1973, Milwaukee was a manufacturing powerhouse. That's how it was referred to. Not a joke. Not a joke.
I don't have to tell anyone in this audience how hard people here work and all of you -- all you -- all you've done to keep this city strong.
Still, by early 2000, Milwaukee had lost around two out of three factory jobs. Eighty thousand jobs were gone. Eighty thousand. And when those jobs were lost, something else was lost as well: pride, a sense of dignity.
My dad -- and I swear to God this was the expression -- used to have an expression. My dad was a high school-educated guy, was well-read, and worked like hell. He didn't have a chance to go to college. He used to say, ""Joey"" -- and this is the God's truth -- ""Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about dignity. It's about respect. It's about being able to look your child in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay,' and mean it."" That's what a job is about. That's what a job is about. (Applause.)
And when the breadwinner in the family loses their job, they lose their pride and the sense of dignity that goes with that.
And people like Ron believe that is a good thing -- that corporate American bottom line is that that's all you need to look at; it's good for America.
Well, that's not my bottom line.
From the day I took office, I was determined to turn it around with -- with now they're calling ""Bidenomics."" It's one of the reasons why I fought so hard to write and get passed the CHIPS and Science Act. (Applause.)
We used to invest more in science and research than any country in the world: almost 2 percent of our gross domestic product. Now it's about seven tenths of 1 percent we invest.
We're the best engineers in the world. We're the best scientists in the world. We're the best researchers in the world. What the hell are we doing?
Well, guess what? That CHIPS and Science Act has generated $231 billion in the last 18 months in private investments, making semiconductors here in America. (Applause.)
And, by the way, we -- the United States -- invented those semiconductors. We invented them when we went to the Moon.
They're those small computer chips, the size of the tip of your finger, affecting nearly everything in our lives, from cellphones to automobiles to the most sophisticated weapons systems in the world.
Let me give you one concrete example.
I met with the chairman of the largest chipmaker in the world in South Korea -- it's called SK -- when I was in South Korea. They're investing, now, $22 billion -- billion -- in America. And I asked them why. This is the God's truth. ""Why America?""
And he said, ""Number one"" -- think of this now. Remember it. ""Number one, there's no safer place in the world to have my investment than the United States of America. And number two, you have the best workers in the world."" And he's right. (Applause.) That's the -- that's the truth. (Applause.)
It's about time Ron Johnson and his friends understood that.
Look, folks, they think you want to IBEW -- I wouldn't be standing here this time without you guys. But the IBEW, they think -- the average American, they're not being mean or anything, they think, ""Well, to be an electrician, you say, 'I want to be an electrician,' and you get a -- you get a card.""
Four to five years of apprenticeship. You hear me? Like going back to college. Four to five years. You get paid, but not nearly what you get paid when you get your card.
You got to talk more about what you do and what it takes to get it done. People aren't trying to be mean. They just don't know. But I'm sure in hell telling them. (Laughter and applause.)
The bottom line is: We invented chips here in America. We used to produce them here. We used to produce 40 percent. And now we're bringing them back home, thankfully. (Applause.)
Thankfully, we have people like Tammy Baldwin, who championed -- (applause) -- no, it's the God's truth -- ""Buy American"" policies, leading a resurgence in manufacturing in Wisconsin and across the country.
You heard me say it before: Where in God's name is it written that America can't lead the world again in manufacturing? Where is that written? Folks --
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Nowhere!
THE PRESIDENT: Nowhere. You got it.
Since I took office, we've attracted more than one half trillion dollars -- let me say it again -- one half trillion dollars in private investment in American manufacturing and the industries of the future.
Spending on construction of manufacfur- -- to manufacturing plants that need to be built nearly doubled in the last two years.
And, you know, that's not just -- that's not just the permanent jobs -- they're generating growth -- economic growth and buil- -- look, construction jobs do that as well. We've added 600,000 good-paying construction jobs since I took office.
When they build these -- these plants to build these chips, guess what? They call them ""fabs."" They're as big as football -- long as football fields. That's how big they are. They're gigantic. And guess what? The people who work there -- you know what the average salary is in these fabs? $116,000 a year. Adfsend you don't need a college degree.
What the hell are we talking about? (Applause.)
Folks, instead of exporting American jobs, we're creating American jobs and exporting American products. And they're being built right here in Wisconsin and places where factories had been shut down.
Look at what you're doing here. Ingeteam came to Milwaukee 10 years ago, thanks to tax incentives in clean energy during the Obama-Biden administration.
Then, exactly one year ago tomorrow, I signed a significant piece of clean energy legisla- -- combining -- combatting the existential threat of climate change -- the single largest investment ever, anywhere in the world, without one single member of the other team voting for it. That law reauthorized those clean energy tax credits and expanded them.
As a result, this com- -- this company -- this company predicts that demand for the wind turbine generators, which they're making right here in this facility, will double next year. (Applause.)
And since I took office, the private sector has announced more than $3 billion in investments -- not million, billion -- in investments for wind energy manufacturing in America. And, by the way, it's cheaper -- cheaper -- cheaper than fossil fuels. (Applause.) Cheaper than fossil fuels.
And that's not all.
Until this year, this company didn't think it made sense to make chargers for electric vehicles in the United States. But then, when I signed the Bipartisan Infra- -- Law -- again, which -- which Ron Johnson and his friends didn't vote -- they all voted against -- that law invests $7.5 billion to build a network of thousands of electric vehicle chargers stretching across the country, including on I-94.
By the way, over 500,000 of these charging stations. That's real jobs. That's real money.
And, by the way, my Grandpop Biden, who died very young -- he was -- died in the hospital I was born in six days before I was there -- I mean before I was born -- he worked for the American Oil Company. His job was to go from town to town, expanding the American Oil Company, building new gas stations. People didn't know whether they wanted a couple thousand gallons of gasoline under the ground where they are.
What happens when you build a gas station? You end up with something like a 7/11 or a doughnut shop or a drugstore around it. It generates economic growth. We're going to be building these facilities all across America so you can plug in and go the width of the country. That way you can travel coast to coast without worrying about running out of power.
Every single one of these chargers must be installed by workers certified by the IBEW plan. Every one. That was a condition. (Applause.) Every one. And every single one must be made in America. (Applause.)
You know, there's a provision in the law that -- I thought I knew a fair amount. But I didn't realize -- maybe you did, Tammy, but I didn't realize, back in the '30s, they passed a law that's consistent with international trade that if the Congress passes a law to spend money and the President has to decide where to spend it, he has to -- he or she has to spend it on American workers and in -- in America -- American products.
Well, most presidents, including Democrats, didn't pay a lot of attention to that. But I did. (Laughter and applause.)
And so, now, to use a non-American product, you've got to have a real good reason, prove to me you can't in fact get it from an American product.
Look, folks, this company concluded that it was an opportunity for them as well. And now, they're making fast-charging EV chargers here in America, right in Wisconsin. (Applause.)
Their goal is to manufacture 13,000 high-speed chargers every single year. And guess what? To the chagrin of your senator -- the other senator -- it's going to add 100 good-paying jobs. (Applause.)
And, folks, this is happening across the state. It's a direct result of those clean energy investments I signed into law a year ago.
Folks, as I've said for a long time -- for a long time: When I think climate, I think jobs. Not a joke. When I think climate, I think jobs. That's the future.
By the way, Texas -- the state of Texas has a very enlightened governor. The very state of Texas has the signifi- -- highest number of wind and solar facilities, I think, of any state in the nation. And it's cheaper than -- than fossil fuel. He wants to shut them down. Isn't that enlightened?
Like the 12 solar energy products in -- Alliant Energy is building across Wisconsin, creating more than 2,000 jobs -- local construction jobs -- most of them union jobs -- and, in the process of serving customers in Wisconsin, saving them more than $1.6 billion in energy costs. These are facts, not fiction.
And back to Kenosha, which was hit hard by the American Motors when it closed, now Paris Solar has broken down in the state -- broke ground on the state's first large-scale solar and battery storage project in Kenosha County. It's creating 300 good-paying construction jobs. Three hundred. (Applause.)
And just today, the company Siemens announced that because of that law I signed and the significant investments we're making in clean energy, they're going to begin manufacturing solar inverters here in Wisconsin. (Applause.)
And, by the way, the American people are going to be learning -- no matter how well educated, you're going to be learning a lot, because I bet most people don't know what a solar inverter is. It converts solar energy from the sun into electricity. Kind of a novel idea, isn't it?
How many times did you ever think, in those days when you had those real big bills in the winter and a hot day came, ""Well, why couldn't we capture all this?"" Well, guess what? They're going to be doing a piece of that. Sunlight shines down, and the inverter turns it into electricity. And they're going to build them just outside of Kenosha.
Don't tell me Americans can't innovate. Don't tell me that.
Since I took office, I've seen more than $3 billion in private investment in clean energy manufacturing, all across Wisconsin. That's Bidenomics. That's investing in America. (Applause.)
Totally consistent with international law and trade agreements.
And investing in America means investing in all of America.
When I ran for president, I made a promise that I would leave no one behind, no part of the country would I leave behind.
I'm getting mad -- a lot of Democrats are getting mad at me because we're investing actually more in red states than blue states right now. But they're all Americans, and I made a promise. I made a promise: no matter where.
And folks, red states, blue states, urban, suburban, or rural -- all of that will benefit from what we do.
That's why I launched the Rural Partners Network to help rural communities, including here in Wisconsin and my state of Delaware -- which is mostly rural, believe it or not -- create jobs and economic opportunity.
And my administration has invested hundreds of millions of dollars to support small- and medium-sized meat and poultry processors across the Midwest, including dozens here in Wisconsin, from Lancaster to Richland Center to Soldiers Grove.
This way, farmers can get the best price for their product. They don't have to deal with the only giant processor that pays them less for what they need -- what they're do- -- (applause) -- no, I mean it.
And that wasn't my idea. That was the Secretary of Agriculture, the former governor of Iowa.
But, folks, that's not all. We're also investing $230 million in Wisconsin to support agriculture that's good for the environment, like planting cover crops that replenish the soil with nutrients and absorb carbon from the air. We're helping farmers, ranchers, foresters get paid for doing the right thing.
It's simple, folks: When farmers do well, when the wealth they generate stays in Wisconsin, then their children can stay in Wisconsin and find opportunity here and build a stronger rural economy. (Applause.)
Investing in America also means rebuilding our infrastructure. The governor talked about how many bridges and roads -- I mean, it's amazing. And it's not even been a year yet. It's just been about a year.
You know, the last guy who talked about ""Infrastructure Month""? We got ""Infrastructure Decade,"" baby. (Applause.) Ten years. Y'all think I'm kidding. They never had one month.
But I'm jo- -- I'm not joking.
And, by the way, a number of my Republican friends voted against this infrastructure bill, including your distinguished other senator.
You know, we used to be number one in the world in infrastructure, but, over time, we slipped to the 13th best infrastructure. Thirteenth best infrastructure in the world from number one.
How can you be the best economy in the world with a second-rate infrastructure? Not a joke. How can you do that?
Well, through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we've already announced 37,000 projects, 4,500 communities across America, including hundreds of projects, as the governor referenced, right here in Wisconsin. (Applause.)
Let me give you a couple of examples.
We're investing $80 million to replace the interstate bridge over the Wisconsin River in Columbia County. That's a major route connecting people to Milwaukee, Madison, and Chicago.
And look across town, where union workers are building North Holton Street Bridge, which is nearly 100 years old. More than 10,000 vehicles travel over it every single day across the Milwaukee River. It's dangerous, and this reconstruction is long overdue. (Applause.)
You were -- a lot of you were with me when I was in Pittsburgh. And, by the way, the -- Pittsburgh is ""the city of bridges."" More bridges in Pittsburgh than any other city in America. I watched that bridge collapse. I got there and saw it collapse with over 200 feet off the ground, going over a valley. And it collapsed.
Thank God school was out during the -- during the pandemic. Imagine all the people who would've died. They knew for years they had to do something, but we're talking hundreds of millions of dollars to rebuild it.
You know, I know everybody kids me because I'm an Amtrak guy. I like rail. (Applause.) Well, I've traveled over 1,280,000 miles on Amtrak. And I know you think that's nuts. I do, too, but my -- (laughter) -- and the reason for that is: When I got elected, I was 29 years old. I was in an office hiring staff, and I got a phone call saying my wife and daughter were dead and my two boys were not likely to live. A tractor trailer broadsided and killed them.
And I didn't want to stay in Washington. So, I said they -- a lot of really good senators, including a couple good Republican friends -- became friends -- said, ""Just come and stay six months; help us organize."" Hell, we had -- we had 58 Democratic senators already and a Democratic governor. I didn't know any better.
But I stayed. And I started to commute every day, because having been listed as the poorest man in the Congress for 36 years -- true. My wife called me one day and said, ""Did you read the paper today?"" And I was up campaigning for a guy named Pat Leahy in Vermont. I said, ""No, honey. I didn't see the Wilmington paper."" She said, ""Headline, above the fold"" -- only a politician's wife would say that -- (laughter) -- ""'Biden, poorest man in Congress.' Is that true?"" Like I was cheating on her or something. (Laughter.)
But I was. And I couldn't afford a house in Washington, and I couldn't afford a house in Delaware. If I sold my house in Delaware, I would lose the election. So, I started to commute. It's only 300 miles a day, but it still takes me an average of four hours, beginning to end.
And so, what happened was I -- when -- when you travel as Vice President on Air Force planes, they keep a precise number of miles you travel. And I guess it was in my seventh year or sixth year as vice president, I -- there was a headline in a New York paper saying, ""Biden travels almost 1,200,000 miles on -- on Air Force planes."" One -- one million two -- one hundred, or whatever.
I'm getting on the train one day with the -- the Secret Service are the best in the world. They don't like me traveling on the train because there are too many opportunities for people to do bad things on trains. And so, I'm getting on a train to go home and see my mom, who was sick and in hospice in my home.
And this guy -- I won't mention his name, because they -- it would get him in trouble. But one of the senior guys in Amtrak who I rode -- rode with all the time comes up and goes, ""Joey, baby,"" and grabs my cheek. (Laughter.) I swear to God, I thought they were going to shoot him. (Laughter.)
And I said, ""No, no, no, no."" I said, ""What's the matter, Ang?"" He said, ""We just -- I read this thing about a mil- -- over a million miles on Air Force planes."" He said, ""Hell, you know how many miles you traveled on Amtrak?"" I said, ""No, Ang. I don't know."" He said, ""We just had a retirement dinner up in Newark."" He said, ""You traveled a hundred -- an average 117 days a year, round trip, 300 miles a day, 36 years. That's 1,285,000 miles. I don't want to hear any more about the Air Force."" (Laughter and applause.)
True story, I swear to God.
I'm getting off point here, but anyway. (Laughter.)
But rail saves a lot -- electric rail saves a lot of energy -- a lot of energy and the environment.
Thanks to the infrastructure law, we're providing $23 million to upgrade and modernize Mitchell International Airport, which is going to increase economic activity in Milwaukee. (Applause.)
We're also removing every single lead pipe in Wisconsin -- (applause) -- every single one. These lead pipes are dangerous.
Some of you may remember, I had a guest at the last State of the Union when I was speaking, and it was a young woman named Deanna Branch. She's a Milwaukee mom. She had her 3-year-old son, Aidan, with her, who was hospital- -- twice for lead poisoning because of lead pipes in their home.
Well, guess what? We're removing every single lead pipe in Wisconsin out of the ground. (Applause.) That's a fact. They're a risk to everyone's health, especially to our children's.
And then, over 250,000 homes and small businesses across Wisconsin don't have access to high-speed, affordable Internet. No parent should have to sit outside a McDonald's when we have a -- schools are closed to be able to get on McDonald's Internet so the kid can do their homework. Not a joke. Well, guess what? They do if you don't have Internet at home.
That's why we're investing over $1 billion in every corner of this state, especially rural communities and family farms, with affordable high-speed Internet. Every single home. (Applause.) And folks, all our high-speed Internet projects must use products and construction materials made in America. (Applause.)
Look, folks, it's really kind of basic. We just decided to invest in America again. That's what it's all about.
I want you to see exactly what we're making these investments across the country. If you want to know exactly where they are, you can go on the Internet. Go to: Invest.gov. Put in your location and find out what's happening -- exactly what's happening or scheduled to happen.
Folks, we've done all this without raising anybody's taxes making under 400,000 bucks. (Applause.)
My friends talk about the ""Big Spendin' Biden."" Well, guess what? I made a promise: I'll never raise federal tax on anyone making less than $400,000 a year. I kept my promise. (Applause.)
And unlike the last President, in my first two years in office, even with all we've done, I'm the first one to cut the federal debt [deficit] by $1 trillion 700 billion. (Applause.) One trillion seven hundred billion dollars cut because we generated the growth.
Folks, every Republican voted against our clean energy investment, known as the Inflation Reduction Act. The vast majority voted against the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. But that didn't stop them from claiming credit for protecting the health of their constituents that are getting rid of lead by -- getting rid of lead pipes or putting to work and building new roads and bridges.
Look, I think the vast majority of my Republican colleagues in the Senate know better. We got to stop the partisanship. We've got to stop this stuff.
This legislation they opposed or attack is now the greatest thing to come to their states. You know, there are -- you have Marjorie Taylor Greene -- you know, the very quiet lady from North Caro- -- from -- from Georgia. Well, she's talked about, ""What Biden is doing is what Roosevelt did and what Kennedy did and what"" -- I thought, ""Well, yeah."" (Laughter.)
But, look, folks, like I said: I made a commitment, because I knew this was going to happen. I knew what would happen is the folks who voted against these things -- and we barely passed them, sometimes by one or two votes -- when it came to their states, would claim credit.
I want them to get credit. That's okay. It's okay, as long as they continue to support the things we're doing.
You know, I re- -- I said I represent all the American people in red states and blue states, but that doesn't mean I can't make fun of the hypocrisy -- (laughter) -- of those claiming credit. And like I said in the State of the Union, I'll see them at the groundbreakings. (Laughs.) (Applause.)
Look, let me close with this. I'm not here to declare victory on the economy. We're not there yet. We have more work to do, but we've always had a plan that turning things around, making in -- America stronger and safer and more competitive.
Bidenomics is just another way of saying ""restoring the American Dream."" That's the ba- -- that's what it is, just restoring the American Dream.
I believe every American willing to work hard should be able to get a job no matter where they live -- in the heartland, small towns; raise their kids on a good paycheck; and keep their roots where they grew up.
That's the American Dream. That's Bidenomics.
It's rooted in what has always worked best for this country: investing in America, investing in Americans. Because when we invest in our people, when we strengthen the middle class, we see stronger economic growth that benefits all Americans.
The most important thing I want to say today is this: Thank you. Not thank you for how you voted, but thank you to the people of Wisconsin. Thank you to the American people.
We've faced some pretty tough times in recent years. The pandemic took over 1 million lives. How many empty chairs are there sitting around dining room tables these days? Our neighbors, our friends, our fellow Americans -- they're still living in pain and loss and isolation caused by the pandemic.
It generated the most severe economic crisis since the Great Depression. It wasn't that long ago that 20 million people in America were out of work.
But today, the American people -- they didn't give up. Wisconsin didn't give up. Americans didn't give up. America didn't give up.
And I've said it a thousand times: There is no quit in America. There is no quit in America. Look how far we've come. (Applause.)
Today -- today -- it's not hyperbole -- we have the strongest economy in the world. And you're looking at me a little skeptical, but I promise you. Check it out. The strongest economy in the world, the highest job satisfaction in 36 years.
Our inflation rate has dropped to the lowest among major economy -- economic nations in the world. And if we keep it up, it's going to go lower, according to (inaudible).
All I hear from my friends on the other side of the aisle is what is wrong with America. There's a lot wrong with America, like every country. They tell us America is failing, but they're wrong.
Democrats, Republicans, independents, conservatives, liberals -- I don't think they understand the average American. Whatever (inaudible) we set our mind to as a country, we've always accomplished. Name me one thing in American history where America stood together and said, ""We're going to solve that problem"" and we didn't do it. Name me one. Name me one.
There's nothing beyond our capacity.
America isn't failing. America is winning. (Applause.)
And I'm proud of the historic legislation my administration has passed. They were the right steps not only to get our economy moving again but to build to the future.
But the real hero in this story is all of you, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart: the people of Milwaukee, the people of Wisconsin, the American people.
Yes, my policy helped create a lot of these jobs and it has continued to grow, but you're the ones getting up every single day, walking out that door, and doing the work.
Yes, my policies have helped to create some small businesses. We've created more than in any time in history. But you're the ones who decided to borrow the money and take the risk in the middle of this (inaudible). You took the risk to hire workers, fulfilling your dreams.
I've long said it's never, ever, ever been a good bet to bet against America -- never, never, never. And it's not a good bet today.
This is still a country that believes in honesty, decency, and integrity. The vast majority of Americans do. Our political leaders sometimes in both parties don't.
We're still a country that believes in hard work. We're still a country that believes in -- each and every one of us is created equal. We're still a beacon to the world.
That's because small towns and in rural America and suburbs, big cities all across the country, every ordinary perpso-- -- people -- all ordinary people do the most extraordinary things.
Let me tell you, America's best days are ahead, not behind us. Not because of me. Because of you.
It isn't about the past; it's about the future. It's about each of us writing the next chapter in American history.
I can honestly say I've never been more optimistic -- and I mean this from the bottom of my heart -- I've never been more optimistic about America's future, both domestic and foreign.
We just have to remember who in the hell we are. We're the United States of America. There is nothing -- nothing -- beyond our capacity when we do it together.
So, let's do it together, God love ya. (Applause.)
May God bless you all. And may God protect our troops.
Thank you. (Applause.)

Joseph R. Biden, Remarks in Milwaukee, Wisconsin Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/364002 "
2023-08-10 00:00:00,"Remarks at a Campaign Reception in Park City, Utah","
Please, please sit down. Thank you. Well, first of all, you know, I had forgotten about that incident. It was the time when there was a lot of discussion going on in the administration: Would we recognize same-sex marriage?
And I was raisedI was a lucky man. I was raised by a father who was athought everyone was entitled to be treated with dignity. I remember when I wasI hadn't thought about this a long time. I remember when I was a kid, I was a lifeguard at a country club, but I wanted toI wasgot deeply involved in the civil rights movement. And so I wanted to work in what they called ""The Bucket,"" which was a public housing complexa large complex on the east side of Wilmingtonandwhich was all African American.
And they had thelike all big cities, they had three major swimming pools. One on the east side, which is where theya thousand African American kids a day would come and swim in this big pool. And I wanted to be a lifeguard there.
And so my dad, on the way to work, would drop me off at the city hall to go in and get my application for being the employeethe only White lifeguard thatwell, not at the time, but I was the onlyI wasn't applying to be the only WhiteI just happened to be the only White lifeguard.
And it's in what they call Rodney Square. If any of you have any little corporations in Delawarethere's more corporations in Delaware than every other State in America combined, not a joke. And the fact is that it was a great corporate entity at the time: Rodney Square. There was the DuPont Building, the Hercules Building, and other major buildings around that square.
So I was getting out of the car to go into the city hall. And these two well-dressed men leaned over and kissed one another. And I'd never seen that before. I turned and looked at my dad. And I just looked at him. He said: ""Joey, it's simple. They love each other. It's simple."" And so I got lucky, the kind of dad I had.
And these two little kids, when we walked into this home werewhen I was talking to them, they said, ""I want you to meet my daddy and my mommy,"" and they were two men. And I watched how they loved both those kids and how the kids loved them.
And I told Barack, at the time, that I wasn't going to go out and make it a campaign issue beforehand. But if anybody asked me, I wasn't going to be silent. No one had asked me. [Laughter] No one ever doubts I mean what I sayI mean when I say; sometimes I say all that I mean.
And so I got on the show, and the first question he asked me was that question. I was persona non grata with everyone but Barack for a while because it was thought to be a political liability.
But look, folks, you know, I thinkthis is going sound counterintuitiveI've never been more optimistic about America's prospectsnot because I'm President. I mean that sincerely. I think we're at a genuine inflection point in world history. It happens everyanywhere from 6 to 10 generations. And things change so rapidly that it's not because of any one man or woman, but there'slike it's watching pieces on the chessboard switch around.
Think of all the change that's going to take place just because of the change in populations, the change injust global warming, what it's affecting.
And so I amwhat makes us best prepared to deal with this, in my view, has been the fact that we're the most unique nation in the history of the world. Now, that sounds like hyperbolelike ""We, the United States""every other nation is based on ethnicity, religionsomething that is coherent. We're the only nation in the world based on an ideanot a joke. An idea: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men and women are created equal endowed by their Creator.""
We've never lived up to it, but we've never walked away from it. That was the idea. And it created the institutions. We're a product of our political institutions. That's what has held us together.
And quite frankly, I know I don't look it, but I've been around a long time. [Laughter]
But all kidding aside, I thinkI made a speech when I ran the first time for President in 2020, this last time, at Independence Hall in Philadelphia on democracy. I think democracy is at stake. I think our institutions are being questioned like they've never been before.
You have a President who says if he's reelected, he's going to change the institutional structure of this country. He's made statements, and he means some of it.
And so there's a great deal at stake. But the very thing that many people think is our weaknessis our diversityI think it's our strength. I think it's our strength.
And I think whento make a generic, overarching point, wheneverthere's never been a problem that the United States has set out to deal with we haven't solved when we've done it together. I'm serious.
I was asked not long ago: If you could do anything, what would you do?"" I said, ""I'd cure cancer."" They said, ""Why?"" Because Americans don't believe we can do that anymore. It seems to be the thing that most people think that is the hardest thing to deal with, and they doubt it. I don't. I don't.
And many of you are doctors and clinicians. And you know we're a step away, across the board. That's why I was able to get $6 billion for our cancer research institute, focusing.
My generic point is this: I've never been a big fan of trickle-down economics. No, I'm serious. And it's been a Democratic and Republican basis for[inaudible]for a long, long time.
Not much trickledmy dad was a well-readhe got accepted when he was out of school to Johns Hopkins. Couldn't afford to go and ended up inanyway, make a long story shortbut he was a very well-read man. But my dadmy dad never got to go to school. And he alwaysit was one of his great regrets he didn't get to go to college.
And my dad used to say: ""Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about being able to look your kid straight in the eye and say, 'It's going to be okay,' and mean it."" And he meant it. That's not hyperbole. My word as a Biden. That was part of the mantra that we learned.
And so I've thought I started off with the notion that, from an economic standpoint, we have enormous opportunities. But the best way to make sure that we're able to live in places like thisand I'm not being solicitous, and I mean it seriouslyfor the wealthy to do very wellis if the middle class does well, the poor have a way up, and the wealthy do well.
And so one of the things I did, setting out in our economic policy, is to focus on: How do you build a middle class? What do you do to build a middle class? And if you notice, there's nothere's been noI don't knowhyperbole about the wealthy and all. That's not who I am.
But I am supportive of the notion that middle class people have a shot. And what's the best way to give them a shot? It's provide them access to a decent education.
For example, I met with the Business Roundtable. Many of you know it. Maybe some of you are members. And they asked why I keep talking about spending more money on education.
And I said, ""Well, one of the reasons I do that is because, if you remember, when I was Vice President, I met with 558excuse me358 of the Fortune 500 leaders. I said, 'What's the thing you need most, you think? What's the thing you need the most?' He said, 'That you all set a better educated workforce.' I said, 'You used to pay for it.'""
The DuPont Company used to be the eighth largest company in the world when I wasgot elected as a 29-year-old kid. They bought a new enterprise; they trained their personnel in that new enterprise. We don't do that anymore. We expect the Government to do it, but the Government doesn't expend the dollars to do that.
We learned, for example, if you are able toall the studies that were done in the last 12 years fromthere was a joint studyStanford and Harvardwhat would happenyouand all of you know these numbers I know.
But, for example, if you come from a home where it's a broken home, where parents don't read to their children, where there's not books in the house, or where one of the parents is an addict orthe kid coming out of that home is going to hear a million fewer words spoken by the time they get to first grade. Not different wordswords. They're not engaged in the conversations. They're going to find themselves in position where they're behind the eight ball.
But if you send a kid to schoolreading, writing, and arithmeticat age 3, you improve by 58 percent the prospect of them going all the way through 12 years of school without a problem and getting on and going to community college.
And why are we not doing that? We can afford to do it. I would argue we can't afford not to do it.
And so there's more to be done, in terms of education, than we're doing now. But there's basic things that we haven't focused on, in my view.
And so what I've done in terms of trying to getit used to be thatI was recently in his home State. I was recently out intalking to my old buddy, the former leader of the House in Mainefrom MaineGeorge Mitchell. And I got awarded when I left the Senate as being the most bipartisan Senator in the Senatebeing able to get more done between Democrats and Republicans than any other member of the United States Senate. I'd only been there 36 years at that time. [Laughter]
But all kidding asidebut look what's happened. We barely talk to one another anymore, the way we address one another.
When I announced last time, I said I was running for three reasons. One, to restore the soul of this country. And by that, I meant the same thing that Jon Meacham was talking aboutthe Presidential historianand that is a sense of decency. Just a sense of honor.
Think of the way we talk to one another. Think of the language used in our discoursepolitical discourse, public discourse.
You know, I ride byas I ride through with the on thewhat they call ""the Beast""those big Cadillacs with those flags on itallI get an awful lot of people waving and hollering and wanting to say nice things. But you ride through certain areas, there's these big flags saying, ""Trump"" with ""f-u-c-k"" in the middle of it. And little kids standing there and giving you what we effectively referred to as ""the bird"" when we were kids. [Laughter] I mean, how far have we come?
So, look, one of the things that we did was tosecondly, and to reestablish access for middle class growth.
And thirdly, to bring the country together again, to unite the country.
And that'sthe press is here. And the press understandthey've heard me say this before, and they're honest about how they cover everything. And that is thatthey said thatI got wildly criticized by a lot of major reporters who have otherwise been fairly generous in their references to what I do. Because those days are gone.
If in a participatory democracy we can't bring people together, we're done. We're finished. We're finished as a democracy. And we're falling into campslike warring camps. And so we've got to stop.
And so, look, here's whatin the first 2 years, we were in a situation where we brought inflation down by two-thirds. The Economist and the Wall Street Journal initially started off referencing Bidenomics with sort of tongue in cheek. Well, they're not doing that anymore aboutit's no longer tongue in cheek.
The Bidenomics program is, we've built the economy from the middle out and the bottom up. And today, inflation is down two-thirds. And we've created 13 million jobs in 2 years and 800,000 manufacturing jobs; 3.5-percent uninflation [unemployment; White House correction], the lowest continuous rate in 55 years.
The American Rescue Plan vaccinated the Nation and got the economy moving again. We found ourselves in a position where the bipartisan infrastructure lawremember, we hadwe're going have a excuse me. We were going to have investments in all our infrastructureinfrastructure month. We were going to have that on a monthly basis with the last guy. Nothing happened in 4 years.
Now we havewe have we have infrastructure decade. I got my colleagues in both parties to commit to a 10-year commitment to $1 trillion 300 billion. And guess what? It's attracted an awful lot of investment.
We've attracted private investment investing in America of over a half a trillion dollarsa half a trillion dollars. Many of you were part of that. We're in a situation where they're where we, as I said, the bipartisan infrastructure plan has already generated 37,000 projects. Here in Utah, 60,000 households already are getting affordable high-speed internet. We're in a situation with $28 million for Salt Lake City Airport to resurface the aging infrastructure.
I could go on across the country, but we'reand by the way, not many of my Republican colleagues voted for that piece of legislation. And so thethe distinguished Senator from Alabamathe former coach at the University of Alabama [Auburn University; White House correction]heI was fascinated to see him on television: ""And now I'm about to deliver to the State of Alabama onebillion two hundred and seventy million dollars in internet connectivity."" And he voted against it. [Laughter] I swear to God, he voted against it. So I suggested I go down and help him break ground for it. [Laughter]
But my point is, we're beginning to change. It's going to take time, because people don't know the changes that are taking place are a consequence of what we did yet. And it's going to take a little time for that to break through.
But if you think about itlook, you know, Iwe foundand again, a lot of your business women and men. We found that supply chains matter and access to supply chains matter.
And what did we find out 2 years ago? Well guess what? We invented that little computer chip about the size of athe end my finger heremythe tip of my finger. We're the guys who came up with that ideathat little idea because of the because of the landing on the Moon. That's how we got that far.
And then we made it much more sophisticated. We used to have 40 percent of the market worldwide. Now it's down to 10 percent of the market. And guess what? When the supply chain has dried up because of pandemics in Asia and other places, what happened? Automobile prices skyrocketed, and we couldn't make any moreeverything from your from your cell phone to your washer isneeds to run on these chips.
So I went over to Asia. And everybody thought I was little nuts. I spent some time with the Southwith South Koreans. Got a little company called[inaudible]to invest $100 billion in America. So far we've gotten commitments for investments of over $268 billion in building these factories all across America. We're building one right here in your State.
These are things that are going to generate billions of dollars in revenue, put us in a position where we're not reliant any longer on other countries, and we're the source of being able to make sure we have all that we need.
We're in a circumstance nowfor example, you know, I know there's no global warming. You all know that too. [Laughter] I know there's no global warming. But just in case there is a little global warmingwhat happened was: I had all the major automobile manufacturers on the South Lawn of the White House.
And Mary Barra, the president of General Motors, was suing the State of California for having a higher environmental standard than the Federal Government and said you couldn't do that.
Well, after our little meetingI'm not saying it's because of me, but coincidentally, after our little meeting[laughter]she called me a week later, and she dropped the suit and said they're going to go allhalf the entire production of vehicles by 2030 will be EV. And by 2035, 100 percent.
And you're finding that all across the board, because we have the means and the capability of doing it now. And it's going to fundamentally change the way in which we breathe the air.
We're able toyou know, Ieverybody kids me about being ""Mr. Amtrak."" Well, I've traveled 1,200,000 miles on Amtrak[laughter]for real.
A little story: Iwhen I got elected, I got a phone call. My wife and daughter had been killed in an accident; my two boys weren't going to make it. And so I started to commute back and forth. I wasn't going to stay in Washington. Andbut five Senators got together and said, ""Just stay 6 months."" And here I am. Anywaybut so I started commuting every day.
So I commuted every day for 36 years as a Senator when the Senate was in. I commuted every day, 300 miles a day, every single day. And I estimatedthese conductors went back and got all this data, because they had a big dinner, and showed I averaged 119 days a year, 300 miles a day, et cetera. Then Vice President andand so, I kind of like Amtrak. [Laughter]
But here's the point: We know if you can get onif you can get from point A to point B on rail in the same time it takes to get in the vehicle, you take rail. It would save literally billions of gallons of oil if in fact we hadwe expectso we provided another $45 billion for rail. That's going to just getting underway. You're going to haveanyway, I won't go through the detail. But the generic point is pretty basic.
One of the other things we didmy dad used to say: At the end of the month, for the average, middle class family, it'sdo you haveafter you've paid all your bills, do you have enough left over to have just, what he'd say, ""a little breathing room""? Just a little breathing room.
And even when there's inflation, there's ways to provide breathing room by lowering costs on other items. Now, I have to admit to youI hope I'm not going to offend any of you pharmacists, but the fact is that I think that we should be able to negotiate drug prices, because the VA does that now. And for Medicare, youwe negotiate those prices now.
Well, guess what? Any of you have type 2 diabetes or type 1 diabetes in your family? You were paying between $4- and $800 a month to for that insulin. It costs $10.20 to make it. The guy who invented it did not patent it because he wanted it available for everyonenever was patented. And, in addition to that, if you add the packaging costs, you get up to $13.
So we had a little study done. And guess what? You can buy the insulin now for $35. You make over 600- or 900-percent profit, but it's affordable.
We're negotiating drug prices so that, for example, by the end of 2025, no matter what your cost of your drugsand some of the cancer drugs, as you all knowwe'reall been victims of cancer in our familiesare up to $8,000 a month. Well, guess what? You never have to pay more than a total of $2,000 a month for all your prescriptions.
And by the way, guess what? It saves the Government overclose towell, it's a billionexcuse me, close to $1.8 trillion over time, because that's money we're not paying out from the Government to provide for this. Again, initially controversial, but now even the drug companies are moving along on a lot of this stuff independently.
The end result of a lot of these thingsand by the way, the Inflation Reduction ActI wish I hadn't called it that, because it has less to do with reducing inflation than it does to do with dealing with providing for alternatives that generate economic growth. And so we're now in a situation where if you take a look at what we're doing in the Inflation Reduction Act, we're literally reducing the cost of people being able to make theirmeet their basic needs.
And, for example, we're in a situation where we'reand theabout the Medicare prices, butwell, I'm going to go on too long for you.
But look, some of my friends on the other teamand I met someone today who said: ""I'm a Republican. I'm voting for you. I have a program; I used to be on[inaudible]."" And now he said, ""I'm voting for you."" I didn't ask why. [Laughter]
Any rate, during this process, I've been able to expand the amountI made a commitment that one-third of all the land and waters of America will be in conservation by the time I left officeone-third. It's about 18 percent now.
But what's going on is that in the process of doing this, I'm told of all this incredible amount of money we spend. But guess what? I reduced the debt $1 trillion 700 billion, more than any President has everever, everin American history.
So it'sthis is notsome of it is rocket science, but it's not all rocket science. [Laughter] It's about growth. It's about generating growth.
And folks, you know, I just did an event for another thing I felt very, very strongly about. And granted, it was a little bit parochial, but I've been this way my whole career.
Anyway, my son was the attorney general of the State of Delaware. And hehis National Guard unit was deployed to Iraq, and he gaveyou eitheryou're either Federal property or State property. So he gave up his seat as attorney general to go to Iraq for a year. He came back with a Bronze Star, the Conspicuous Service Medal, and a number of otherbut he also came back having lived next to a burn pit for a total of a year. And he came back with stage 4 glioblastoma.
My generic point is this: We don'twe'rewe have more veterans dyingmore veterans today dying in the last 10 years from suicide than action in the field. More from suicide. And so one of the things we're doing and make sure we did is, we significantly increased the VA budget.
For example, many of those peopleand if you knowyouI bet you know somebody who called and said: ""My son, my husband, my daughter, is having real problems. Can I get her in immediately?"" And they said, ""Well, we have an appointment in a week,"" or whatever. Not a joke. Seventeen soldiers a day committing suicide for the long time now.
So we set up this thing called the legislation that I put together relating to the issue of what the VA can and cannot do. And the legislationI just was at a VA facility here inin the State. And the end result is that we've fundamentally changed the way in which we deal with the VA and anyone who has maybe because I'm of the Vietnam generation: Remember Agent Orange? Well, the problem with Agent Orange was, you couldn't prove whatever you have was a consequence of Agent Orange.
Well, now there's an assumption: If you come back as a consequence of having cancer and having been exposed to these toxic wastesjust like in the 9/11 circumstance, where all those firemen, you know, died of cancer because of what they were doingwell, guess what? Now the families have access to opportunities. They lose the breadwinner in their family, and they can provide for up to $1,000 a month for kids who go on to schoolto college. They can provide for a whole range of things to supplant what they lost as a consequence of these burn pits, which we generated.
We didn't deliberately do it. We didn't know we were doing it. But these are things the size of football fields, 8 to 10 feet deep, where you burn everything from toxic fuels to gasa whole range of things.
I guess what I'm saying is that, you know, we've made somewhat'sit's called the PACT Act. And it's really having a profound impact on the lives of millions of Americansmillions of Americanswho have been exposed.
Now, look, last thing I'll say, because I'm bouncing around too much for you here. I spent most of my time, as the Ambassador will tell you, dealing with American foreign policy. For years, I was the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. And when I was Barack's Vice President, I handled a significant portion of the foreign policy we had to deal with because I knew all these people. I knew the heads of state from being around a long time.
And when I got elected, I took a look at what was happening. There wasNATO was breaking up. Putin haswasand I checked with the intelligence communitywas able to deconflict something so we wouldn't let sources and methods be knownand I predicted he would be invading Ukraine with 150,000320,000 people. And he did. He came in, and he invaded Ukraine, because hishe was absolutely confident he could break up NATOthat NATO would not stick together.
I've had over 180 hours of meetings now with NATO heads of state, and frommost of them in person, initiallybut on Zoom and with direct contactand we've been able to hold NATO together. NATO is stronger today than it ever has been.
If I told you that Germany was going to increase its defense budget, I think you would have told me I was a little crazy. I think if youif I told youwhich I set out to dowe were able to dothat I was going to convince Japan they should increase their budget and helpdirectly help provide aid to Ukraine, you'd say, ""What the hell are they getting involved in Europe?"" Because the world is so damn small, you can't have tens of thousands of troops invade another countryand that's the largest invasion ever since World War IIand not expect it to spread around the world.
And so the bottom line is: We are working in that direction, so we've thus far, essentially, isolated Russia.
And we have China to deal with. And China is a ticking time-bomb in many cases. But it isI'm the only onenow people are beginning to agree: China is in trouble. China was growing at 8 percent a year to maintain growthand now closer to 2 percent a year.
China finds itself in a position where it'sit has the highest unemployment rate going. It's in a position where it'sthe number ofthe number of people who are of retirement age is larger than the number of people of working age. So they've got some problems. That's not good because when bad folks have problems, they do bad things.
Sobut my point is managing China and managing that relationship. And I've spent more time with Xi Jinping than any world leader has. They've kept everythey keep tabs of all of it68 hours of personallyjust he and I with an interpreter eachand another 15 hours on Zoom.
And this is a guy who is awho I think I understand. And this is a guy whowe're not looking for a fight with China. But we're looking for a rationalea rational relationship to have with China.
I don't want to hurt China. But in the meantime, I watched what China was doing. So I put together a thing called the Quad. We brought together as an alliance India, Japan, Australia, and the United States. We put ourselves in a position where now we have the Philippines and, soon, Vietnam and Cambodia wanting to be part of a relationship with us because they'rethey don't want tothey don't want to have a defense alliance, but they want relationships because they want China to know that they're not alone.
So a lot of things are changing, but nothing is done yet. We have to figure out how to deal with Africa. There is going to be a billion people on that continent very shortly. And there arehave some real problems.
But we have enormous opportunities to deal there too, as well. For example, we put togetheror it became known as the Build Back Better initiative. We got together literally billions of dollars in the G-7 nations to provide for alternatives to China'swhat they call Belt and Road Initiative, which is basically a debt and noose agreement that they have. There is not much going on. They're in real debt. They're going in trouble.
So I guess what I'm saying is, we have an enormous opportunity to bring the world together in different configurations than was before in a way that isn't threatening to others and provides a generic stability. And so we're spending a lot of time there. It's not done yet. We've got a lot more to do.
But my generic point is, Iif you read most of the foreign policy experts, you don't see a whole lot of criticism about the approach we've taken to try to deal with thisthese changing pieces inaround the world. It's like, you know, when the North Pole, it doesn't meltlike it melts for real now. But you know, like icebergs break up and theyand when it gets cold, they reconfigure in a different way. That's what's happening around the world.
And so I guess what I'm trying to say to you is that I am optimistic we have an opportunity to leave our kids a world that is more secure, less contentious, and economically more sound than we found it. And I think that's the whole purpose of what I'm trying to do.
And so there is a lot of things that I have not spoken about, from opioids and mental health issues and a whole range of things.
But let me end by this: that I ran for office, as I told you, for those three reasons. And my MAGA Republican friends are trying to take us backtrying to take us back to places that the majority of Republicans don't want to go.
Although, I have seven Senators that are still in the Senateor more than thatthan when I was there. I gave my word I'd never tell who they were, and I'll go to my grave without saying it. But seven of themtwo together came once and then the other five came to me to say: ""I agree with you, Joe. But if I agree with you, then they're going to primary, and I'll lose my seat.""
And so, and you know a lot of your Republican friends aren't happy, but they're not surethey're either scared of Biden andor they're, in fact, worried that they'll cause great difficulty internally.
And so, you know, I truly believe this country is about to take off if we have a little more confidence in ourselvesjust a little more confidence of what we're doing. Not being irrational about it, but realize who we are. We're the United States of America. There is not a damn thing we've ever set our mind to do we haven't been able to donothing when we've done it together.
But this divisionthis division is really, really hurting. And the investments we've made are transformative. And they're going to do something no one thought possible: actually generate real economic growth.
You see what's happening in Europe now. It's beginning to change. You see what's happening ineven in the Middle East. Mark my words: What's goingyou're going to see changes in our relationships with everyone from Saudi Arabia to other countries, because they're all of a sudden realizing they've got problems if they don't change their ways a little bit.
So there's just a lot of reason for hope, but we still need a little bit of luck. Andbut what we don't needwe don't need is an ""America first"" policy.
And a lot of you travel internationally. You won't do it now, but if you travel internationally in your business, raise your hand if you know any world leader in another part of the world you visit that says they want to see Trump come back. No, I'm not being facetious. Can you ever remember thatany other Presidents?
This is the United States of America. There's nothing beyond our capacity. We've got to do it together. And I think we can. I'm going to hush up. Thank you. [Laughter]

2023-08-10 00:00:00,"Remarks on the First Anniversary of the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act of 2022 in Salt Lake City, Utah","
Hello, hello, hello. Please, have atake a seat if you have one.
Sarge, thank you for that introduction. You know, it's important for two reasons. One, I have been in and out of Iraq and Afghanistan over 38 times. And I don't think most people knowthis audience may knowhow many women we have in combat, how many women are not only doing their part, but doing jobs that most people didn't think women would do or could do.
And the Sarge is an example of just that. You know, a Black Hawk helicopter is aanyway. I won't go into it all. But the point is that, you know, Sarge, youwhat happened to you has happened to thousands of people. The Gov and I talked about that earlierthe Governor and Iabout what we're doing here.
You know, you and your fellow veterans are the heart, the soul, and the very spine and sinew of this generation. I mean, that's a fact. You know, only 1 percent of you volunteer to protect all of us. That's what it is. And it's all volunteer.
And I want to thank Dr. Angela Williams and the great team here at the Salt Lake City VA for hosting us and for taking care of our heroes.
Mayor Erin Mendenhall, thank you for the passport into the city. I appreciate that opportunity.
And, Governor Spencer Cox, thank you for your hospitality. But much more importantly, thank you for taking care of our veterans and for bringing along your beautiful family.
And by the way, you know, years agothis is a little ad lib here. But years ago, when John Kerry was the nominee for thefor President of the Democratic Party, he talked with me about the possibility of being Vice President andon his ticket. And I wasn'twe justit was awe were old friends. I said no, I didn't want to be Vice President.
But had I known that as Vice President, I get Secret Service, and had I known that meant my daughters had Secret Service[laughter]and my granddaughters, I would have fought even harder for him at the time. [Laughter]
And now myI have a bunch of grandchildren. They all have Secret Service, and my daughter has Secret Service. And you know, it's just wonderful. [Laughter] I'm not sure what they think about it, but it's just wonderful.
Any rate, thank you very, very much.
Wildfires in Maui, Hawaii 
And look, before I begin, I want to say a word about the devastating wildfires that have claimed at least 36 lives in Maui, in Hawaii. Iwe have just approved a major disaster declaration offor Hawaii, which will get aid into the hands of the people desperatedesperately needing help now. They've lostanyone who's lost a loved one, whose home has been damaged or destroyed is going to get help immediately.
And I've directed that we surge support to these brave firefighters and first responders and emergency personnel working around the clock risking their lives.
I just got off the phone, before I got here, for a long conversation with Governor Josh Green this morning and let him know I'm going to make sure the State has everything it needs from the Federal Government to recover.
The FEMA Administrator Griswell [Criswell; White House correction] will be in Miami tomorrowin Maui tomorrow. And I've directed her to streamline any process which requests for help and survivors registered for immediate Federal assistance without delay. FEMA is surging disaster assistance personnel on the island, and they're going to help survivors get access to Federal assistance.
And you know, anybody who wants to know out there where to goif this is televisedthat they can go to disasterassistance.govdisasterassistance.govto learn if you're eligible for assistance.
And I've ordered all available Federal assets on the islandincluding the U.S. Coast Guard, the Navy 3d Fleet, and the U.S. Armyto assist local emergency response crews from thealong with the Hawaiian National Guard. We're working as quickly as possible to fight these fires and evacuate residents and tourists.
In the meantime, our prayers are with the people of Hawaii, but not just our prayersevery asset we have will be available to them. And we've seenthey've seen their home, their business destroyed, and some have lost loved ones. And it's not over yet.
Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act of 2022 
But now for the reason I'm here today. I've said it many times beforewhen I started saying it 30 years ago, I got criticized occasionally for saying it. I said: We have many obligations as a nation, but we only have one truly sacred obligation, and that's to equip those we send into harm's way and care for them and their families when they come home and when they don't.
One year ago today, we met that sacred obligation when I signedafter fighting so damn hard for the PACT Actto sign it into law. And I want to thank all the veterans organizations for helping make that happen, because it matters.
The PACT Act is one of the most significant laws ever signed to help veterans exposed to toxic materials and theirhelp their families recover as well as receive compensation.
You remember what we mean by burn pits. You know, when we first using the phrase ""burn pits,"" people kind of looked at us. But a burn pit is what you sawbasically, the giant burn pit, the first one everybody was aware of, was in 9/11 when the buildings came down. Remember all those firemen that died of cancer and how wethey got covered? Well, when firefighters first responded, that's what happened.
Now, the burn pits in Iraqwhere we're talking aboutand in other countriesin Afghanistan, even in parts ofthroughout the Middle Eastthey're the size of football fields. A hundredup to 100 yards long, 20 yards to 30 yards wide, and 8 to 10 feet deep. And everything you can imagine is thrown into these pits to incinerate themthe wastes of war: tires, poisonous chemicals, jet fuel, and so much more. Toxic smoke thick with poison spreads through the air and into the lungs of our troops in their hooches, where they lived nearby these facilities.
I know. I've been. I've been there in Iraq and Afghanistan. I've seen them. And you can smell it in the air. You can sometimes see it.
And when these troops came homemany of them the fittest and best trained warriors that we ever sent anywherewere exposed to these burn pits, they weren't the same. And thousands of troops and theirthey had to live in their hooches not far fromproximity from these burn pits.
The one in Iraqmy son was about 400 yards from one of the burn pits, living there for a year in his hooch. They breathe that toxic material sometimes for months at a timein the case of my son and his buddies, for an entire yearcausing headaches, numbness, dizziness, cancer.
This is not about my son, but just an example of how close it was. My son Beau was one of those[inaudible]. He went the fittest guy in his unit and came home andand he came home, but died of glioblastoma. It's personal for my family, but it's also personal for so many of you.
Under SecretarySecretary of the VA McDonough and I just had a long talk. He couldn't be here today, but he can tell you we're determined to address this problem come hell or high water and compensate these veterans and their families who have suffered from the consequence of this tragedy.
It was part of my unity agenda, as I called it, when I did my first State of the Unionlast State of the Union to try to bring the country together on things I thought we all could agree on.
First was beating the opioid epidemic, and we're working like hell on that. Tackling the mental health crisis, and there is a mental health crisis in America. Supporting our veteranssupporting our veterans.
Look, I delivered that speech in March of last year. And a few months later in August, with veterans groups making the case and never giving up, the bipartisan PACT Act was on my desk to sign into law. And don't tell me we can't get things done when we work together. Democrats and Republicans worked together to get that done.
In particular, I want to thank Senator Jon Tester, the chair of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, and Representative Mark Takaexcuse me, Takano, as well, the ranking member of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, for their leadership. They never stop fighting on behalf of the veterans and their families.
We learned a horrible lesson after Vietnam: how harmful effects of exposure to Agent Orange took years to manifest themselves in veterans, leaving too many veterans unable to access care when they needed it and deserved it. And we hadthey had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that that was the cause of their problem, which was difficult to prove in the long term.
That's why I supported the Agent Orange Act of 1991 supporting veterans exposed to the harmful substances in Vietnam.
Well, I didn't want to see that again. The PACT Act means today's veterans and their families won't suffer those same painful, frustrating delays and denials.
And here's what itthe law does: It empowers the Veterans Administration, the VA, to move quicker to determine if a veteran qualifies for the benefits of the lawbenefits like monthly disability compensation and regular toxic exposure screenings.
It also means new facilities, new research, and more health care workers at VA hospitals. It includes nearlyand one of the veterans raised this with me todaynearly $30 million for new outpatient clinics right here in Salt Lake City. Right here.
And for families who have suffered the ultimate loss, it means potential access to life insurance, tuition benefits for their surviving family members, home loan assistance, and monthly stipendswhich cannot replace one breadone of the breadwinners in their home, but it sure in hell can help.
For example, a surviving spouse of a veteran who died from toxic illness with two children could be eligible for roughly $2,300 a month for the rest of his or her life. I'm proud to announce that over 340,000 veteran survivors are already benefiting from the law just 1 year after it was signed, including over 2,000 veterans here in Utah.
Veterans are getting the[applause]veterans are getting the care they deserve in every corner of the country. For example, there's an Army veteran who served in Iraq now receiving care for prostate cancer via theat the VA in Seattle. He heard about the PACT Act, and he applied for benefits the day I signed the law. Because he's already a VA patient, he didn't need to submit medical records or get separate exams. His application was approved, and he's now received retroactive payments from the date the law was signed.
Another Army veteran, now in New Hampshire National Guard, with multiple deployments to Iraq and Kuwait learned that he had a that a friend and soldier she deployed with were diagnosed with breast cancer. Just in case, she decided to get a toxic exposure screening free at all veterans enrolled in the VA health care. She too was diagnosed with breast cancer. They caught the cancer early, and she's currently being treated for it. And she's been granted 100 percent service-connected eligibility under the PACT Act, tripling her monthly payment benefits.
Forfolks, it matters. This matters. Folks, we have a moral obligation. This goes beyond the financial. We have a moral obligation to respond to this. And I'm here today to spread the word so every veteran or surviving family member knows how to access benefits of this law.
And because these conditions have already taken such a toll on so many veterans and their families, I directed the Department of Veterans Affairs to treat all 23 presumptive conditions in this law as applicable immediately, like chronic bronchitischronic bronchitis; asthma; many types of cancer, including any type of reproductive cancer; and something we have been fighting for for a long time: veterans-era veteransVietnam-era veterans are entitled to compensation for hypertension.
This is now the law. And let me give you an example of why it matters.
The widow of a 28-year Army veteran in Connecticut applied for survivor benefits after her husband died from gastrointestinal cancer. That was before the PACT Act was passed, and her claim was denied. In April of this year, she learned about the PACT Act and reapplied. One month later, because of her husband's cancer, she's now presumed to be a service-connected under the PACT Act. Sheclaim was approved. Now, she's eligible for survivor's compensation for her son and further his education and the GI Bill.
I'm urging veterans from these decades of war in Vietnam, and Iraq, Afghanistan to enroll in the VA health care, to get screened for toxic exposure, and to promptly file your claim. And for those watching this homeat home, visit VA.gov/PACTp-a-c-t. VA.govI want to say it againVA.gov/PACT. File a claim or apply for VA health care now.
Or go to your local VA hospital and reach out to the veterans service organizationlike Disabled American Veterans, American Legion, the Wounded Warriors Project, the Veterans of Foreign Warsif you need additional assistance. There is no deadline to submit a claim. But if you want to be eligible to receive retroactive benefits for last year, you have to sign up by Monday.
So apply today. The VA will move as quickly as possible to resolve your claim and get the benefits you deserve.
We're also taking other important steps to help the Nation's veterans and servicemembers. We're helping connect veterans to registered apprentice programs so they can transfer the skills they learned in the military to good-paying jobs here at home, now that we're having the largest building boom in 40 years.
The VA is launching a Transition Assistance grant program for organizations that help veterans and their spouses find jobs when they leave the military. The unemployment rate for veterans has hit an alltime low. It is now at 2.8 percent[applause]2.8 percent. And we're damn proud of that. We've made that a priority since we got into office.
This spring, I signed an Executive order directing the VA to cut redtape and give veterans who need assistance at home more flexibility in picking who will be their caregiver.
Earlier this summer, I went to North Carolina, and I signed an Executive order at Fort Liberty. It'scalls the most comprehensive set of administrative actions in the history of thisand to support the economic security of military veterans, their spouses, caregivers, and survivorslike making it easier for a military spouse to find a job in the Federal Government, expanding access to childcare for military families.
You know, when I first took office, I signed the American Rescue Plan, which invested $17 billion for veterans health care, including mental health care and suicide prevention, to deal with the fact that more veteransmore veteranshave been and continue to die of suicide than in battle over the past two decades. More veterans die of suicide.
And all the stories I heard in my home Statepeople would call up and be looking for help. ""My husband, he needs help. He needs""and couldn't get through. ""We'll get back to you."" Seventeenseventeena day dying of suicide nationwide. Seventeen a day. Even one veteran dying of suicide, particularly because you couldn't get the help immediately, is one too many.
The VA is doing everything it can do, including expanding mental health screening, increasing access to legal and financial support, hiring more mental health professionals, which was onewherewhere's my commander that was here?one that you brought up. We're hiring more. We're hiring.
Including through a proven program that recruits veterans to help other veterans understand what they're going through to get the help they need.
I can noticeif you can stop for another second. You know, one of the things about the military, you're taught to be tough, stand alone, do what you need to do. And it's awful hard when you're having problems and you think you have a mental health problem to ask for help. It's really hard.
There is no difference between having a mental health problem and breaking your arm or your leg. No difference. And you should not be worried about asking for help any more than you would if you had broke your leg. We have to make sure people know there's nothing to be ashamed of in seeking that help.
You know, think about this. I don't know how manyof my tens of thousands of miles that I've traveled through war zones, I don't know anybody who would not wonder whether or not what these veterans have seen causedcould cause posttraumatic stress. It's enormous. It's an enormous problem. They just need help to get through this.
We're working to the end veterans homelessness as well. No one should be homeless in this country, especially not those who served it. Period.
Last year, the VA found permanent housing for over 40,000 veterans and set a goal of permanently housing at least another 38,000 this year. And I'm proposing that the Congress join in and triple the number of rental assistance vouchers for extremely low-income veterans[applause]now. Now. Now.
In securing a bipartisan budget agreement earlier this summer and preventing an economic collapse, we stopped draconian cuts in veteran services. That agreement including dedicated funding for our veterans health so that the health care of those who served so bravely in this country won't be used as a bargaining chip going forward to try to get other things cut.
The agreement also fully funds the PACT Act and expands nutrition benefits that will now be available to our veterans. After serving this Nation, no veteran should go hungry. No veteran should go hungry.
Just 2 weeks ago, I signed an Executive order to significantly strengthen how the military handles sexual assault. We're moving the authority for addressing sexual assault claims to a specialized independent military unit outside the chain of command. That was a long time in coming. But it's a big deal.
And we all owe a thanks to Senator Gillibrand in New York for her leadership in this because she did not give up until she got it done.
And there is more to do. But we've made a lot of progress. And we've got to keep going.
Let me close to this. After I signed the PACT Act into law last August, I handed the penthere is a tradition when you sign a piece of legislation, particularly a significant piece, you have the people who are responsible for getting it done for you on the stage with you when you sign it. And you traditionally give the pen to the most consequential person who helped that happen.
We got finished, and I signedthe pen to the widow and daughter of Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson, a veteran for whom the bill was named. His widow was also my wife's guest at the State of the Union. A family that suffered the greatest of losses, but turned their pain into purpose.
And I handed the pen not to the mother, but to Sergeant Robinson's little girl. A lovely little kid sitting next to me. And she looked at me, and she said: ""Thank you for my daddy."" ""Thank you for my daddy."" I think she was talking for all of us, everyone who fought so hard and came together to keep our promise to the veterans and to keep faith with our heroes. That's courage. That's character.
That's who all of you are. Not hyperbole. I want to thank you allDemocrat, Republican, Independentsfor your work to get this bill to my desk and to get it signed.
As I said, I was going to sign that bill come hell or high water, no matter how long I had to keep the Congress in.
It's just another reminder of what we know to be true: We are the United States of America. There's nothingnothingbeyond our capacity when we decide to work together to get it done. We never fail when we do that. Never on any major issue.
So God bless you all. And let's continue to work together. And God save our veterans.
Thank you.

The President. Hey, folks. Thisthis is a team sport. It's a team sport. I'm going to talk about that in a minute.
Thank you for the nice comments.
Arcosa, Inc., President and Chief Executive Officer Antonio Carrillo. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you.
The President. Antonioplease if you have a seat, take it. [Laughter] Antonio, thank you for that introduction and for hosting us here today.
Governor, you are the verywhere are you sitting?
Audience member. Over here!
The President. You're the very best, kid. You're the best. [Laughter] No, no, no, no, that's a fact. You're the best. I love you. Thank you. Thank you.
And, Senator Heinrich, I tell you what, I'm gladI was a flanker back. I'm glad I didn't have you on the other side as a tight end. [Laughter] But good to see you, man. Thank you. And thank your whole family. It was great to meet them.
And that guy sitting next to youyou know, I haveBen Ray Lujn. I don't know where he came from, but I tell you what[laughter]I told him I'm prepared to help in terms of making sure that those folks are taken care of, by the way. Over at[applause].
And Representative Stansbury, God love you, kid. I tell you what. [Laughter] You are really doing a great job. Thank you for all your cooperation. And thanks for your advice and your help.
And Teresa Leger Fernndez, who isn't here today, but they're
Audience members. She's over here!
The President. Well, thereyes, what am I thinking? I thought you had to leave. [Laughter]
By the way, her son thereI tell you what, I'd keep an eye on him. I may be calling him Mr. President someday. I don't know.
Gabe is the one who couldn't be here today. He's the incredibleyou have an incredible congressional delegationyou really dohere. First rate. You really do.
And thanks to all the Tribal leaders for being here. I just want you to know, I was raised by a guy most of you don't know. He was a wonderful, wonderful man and a great friend. His name was Danny Inouye. And he said, ""Joe, it's 'Indian Nations.'"" He taught me early on. Early on. But thank you, thank you, thank you for all you've done.
We had a good day yesterday in your neighboring State of Arizona. I was able to put away just about a million acres of sacred land. [Applause] I know. That's good stuff.
You know, I got so tired, over the last 15 yearsand this is a little story I want to tell you about why I'm soI was telling the team here: I've never beenI've been aI know I don't look it, but I've been around a long time. [Laughter] But I've never been more optimistic in my whole career than I am today about America's prospects in both foreign and domestic policy.
You know, went through an awful long time watching companies, in the last 15 years, decide to invest overseas because the labor was cheaper, shutting down factories all across Americaall across America.
And I asked myself: Why do we have to put up with that? We're sending jobs abroad and importing products at home. We knew we could change it. I just knew we could change that. We have the best workers in the world.
And my team[applause]no, and my team and I decidedyou know, if you'll hold herethere's a law that was passed in the thirties. It says any money that Congress sends me toto spend, I can insist that it all be spent on American products with American workers. No President has paid much attention to that in anyin either party. But guess what? I'm paying attention.
As a simple propositionI mean this sincerely, from the bottom of my heartwe decided we're going to invest in America. And this company is a great example.
They're now poised to be the leader in the wind industry. But a few years ago, they were laying off workers because we weren't investing in them. So we passed a significant climate legislation not only that moves us away from fossil fuels to acleaner technologies like wind, but it means we're going to make things and new technology here in America.
And there's no reason[applause]. There's no reason why we can't do it. We have the best educatedwe have the most advanced technology in the world. Why are we not doing that? That's basically what we're talking about today when we talk about investing in America.
So today I want to talk about theour progress in growing the economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down.
I came to office determined to move away from trickle-down economicsInot a whole lot trickled down on my dad's kitchen table when we were growing upand focus instead on the middle class, because the middle class built America. And guess what? Guess what? And unions built the middle class. That's not hyperbole. That's a fact.
And, folksand when the middle classI'm a capitalist. When the middle class does well, everybody does well. The poor have a way up, and the rich were able to be very rich. Just make sure they pay a little more of their taxes.
Audience members. Yes!
The President. But look, the Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal have started to callhave started to call my plan ""Bidenomics."" Initially, I don't think they meant it with a great deal of respect. [Laughter] With all due respect for them, our plan is working. It's working.
The economy has grown since I took office. It grew faster in the last quarter than anyone expected. And you know, we created over 13 million brandnew jobs since I took office13 million in less than 3 years. Ninety thousand new jobs right here in New Mexico. Eight hundred thousand manufacturing jobs nationwide800,000.
And I know that you're tired of hearing me say this, but where is it written that America can't lead the world again in manufacturing? Because we're going to do just that: the leading manufacturer in the world.
It's not like this isthese are facts. It's not hyperbole. We've created more jobs in 2 years than any President in American history has in a 4-year term.
Unemployment has been below 4 percent for the longest period stretch in 50 years of American history. And not only have we recovered all the jobs we lost during the pandemic, we now have more jobs than we did before the pandemic.
Because unemployment's been so low for so long, workers aren't just finding more jobs. They're able to look for better jobs at higher pay. And according to the research surveys, job satisfaction in America is higher than it's been in the last 36 years. Look, the share of workingthe share of working-age Americans with jobs is as high as it's been in 20 years. That's never happened under my predecessor.
So where are we now? Well, unemployment is down, and so is inflation. Remember all the experts, including some that worked for me, told us that to get inflation under control we needed to lower wages and reduce the number of people working. No, I'mthatthat's been sort of gospel. [Laughter] Not a joke. Seriously. Some of you here in the audience are economists. You know that.
But I never bought itthe problem was, too many people are working or working people are workingmaking too much money. That's not the problem.
There is a lot of reasons for inflation is up. First, the pandemic. Second, the war in Ukraine. Third, broken supply chains.
Now, one reason we've seen inflation fall by two-thirds without losing jobs is, we're seeing corporate profits come back down to earth.
We have more to do, but inflation is now at its lowest point in 2 years. In fact, we have the lowest rate of inflation among the world's major economies. No other economymajor economy in the world isinflation as low as we are. It's down from 9 percent to 3 percent.
There is a lot more work to do. I'm not satisfied with where it is. More work aheadthe Washington Post recently suggested in anfront-page articleI think it was front pagethat, quote, ""Republicans may have to find something else to criticize Biden for now that inflation is coming down."" [Laughter] I'm sure they'll find something. [Laughter]
At the same time, pay for low-wage workers has grown at the fastest pace in over two decades, and wages are growing faster than inflation. And we're continuing to make progress in fixing the supply chains.
For example, we couldn't access semiconductors during the pandemic because the factories making them overseas were shut down. We all know semiconductors are those little small computer chips about the size of the end of your fingertip that affect nearly everything in our lives, from cell phones to automobiles, refrigerators, to the most sophisticated weapons system, including the systems that Los Alamos and Sandia National Laboratories provide for our national security.
America invented these chips. We invented them when we went to the Moon. We made them work better. We made them more sophisticated. But over time, we went from producing nearly 40 percent of those chipsthe world's chipsdown to 10 percent. That's why I designated and I signedand I insisted that it be written and passedthe CHIPS and Science Act exactly almost 1 year ago today. Very short[applause].
Now, all over the country, semiconductor companies are investing in a record billions of dollars. By the way, do you know how much has been committed in the CHIPS and Science Act to be invested in America? Two hundred and thirty billion dollars. Two hundred and thirty billion dollars to bring chip productionto bring chip productionback home in Ohio, New York, Arizona, and right here in New Mexico.
Look, just a few years ago, Intel cut 700 jobs at its semiconductor fab in Rio Rancho. Now they're expanding their fab with a $3.5 billion investment, creating 700 new jobs, many of which won't require a college degree.
And by the way, that's over $200 billion. They're building fabs. They're just called factories. They're the size of a football field, not much wider than this. And guess what? Average salary is about 130,000 grand. And guess what? You don't need a college degree. Make over $100,000it's about time. And, folks, unions are building the structures as well.
Look, folks, that's Bidenomics.
Since I took office, we have attracted over a half a trillion dollarshalf a trillion dollarsin private investment in manufacturing and industries of the future right here in America.
According to Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs and Wall Street, my ""Invest in America"" agenda is leading to a boom in manufacturing investment. Spending on construction for manufacturing plants nearly doubled in the last 2 years after growing only 2 percent the previous 4 years.
Last quarter, factory construction contributed more to the gross domestic product than any time in 40 years40 years. Instead of exporting American jobs, we're creating American jobs, and we're exporting American products. And we're seeing it right here in America. We're seeing it in New Mexico as well.
In 2008, Solo cup factory shut down right here, right where we're standing. Two hundred people lost their jobs. Nearly a decade and a half later, a plastics company bought the site. It shut down after 3 years, laying off a hundred workers. It's been idle ever since.
Now, it's coming alive again. Arcosa makes wind turbineswind towers. Thosethat's the thing that holdsmostwhen I say that, people think at me like wind toweryou all know what a wind tower is. They look at my like, ""What the hell is a wind tower?"" [Laughter]
That's a key component. You know, you have to have it to hold up thoseyou know how longby the way, I was in Eastern Colorado looking at the blades manufacturer. Those blades are a hundred and three yards long, longer than a football field. And by the way, they don't cause cancer. [Laughter]
And by the way, wind energy is cheaper than fossil fuel. Solar energy is cheaper.
A few years ago, business took a turn, and they were forced to lay off 200 employees at plants all across America. Now, thanks to the new law I signed making historic investments in clean energy, business is booming again.
By the way, thatthey call it the Inflation Reduction Act, but within that is the act relating to the climate, and it's $368 billion. And when I passed that, not one single guy on the other team voted for it. Nobody voted for it on the other team.
Since I signed that lawbill into law, Arcosa has received $1.1 billion in orders for new wind towers. And today we're here breaking ground on a new plant that's going to create 250 new good-paying jobs.
And meanwhile, we're speeding up permitting for transmission lines so wind energy produced by these towers reaches people's homes. Because what's happening now is, it's hard to get at thesea lot of these towers are old. And everybody is: ""Not in my neighborhood."" They don't want a big new tower going up.
So we're strengthening the towers, and we're going to go underground. It costs six times as much to go underground, but we're learning how to do that more cheaply so it doesn't cause the forest fires and all the things that happen when major wind storms knock these lines down.
My administration recently completed a review of a proposed SunZia line to transportation energy from a planneda planned wind farm here in New Mexico and Arizona and California. So you're going to generate the wind hereI mean, the energy hereand be able to transmit it all the way across Arizona and into California as well.
These projects are expected to create 2,000 new construction jobs and up to 150 permanent jobs, providing clean energy for up to 3 million Americans3 million[applause]and reducing the pressures of climate change.
Like I said, Bidenomics is about bringing supply chains back home.
Arcosa makes wind towers that's going to go into turbines made by GE Veronaexcuse me, I mispronounced it: Vernovain Florida and New York. Pattern Energy will use these turbines to build the largest wind farms in the Western Hemisphere, spanning Lincoln, Torrance, and San Miguel Counties in New Mexico. And SunZia will use that energy to power homes all across the Southwest.
That's Bidenomics. It's cheaper. It's cheaper. That's what we're talking about: investing in America.
You know, this company says the investing they're making here is a direct result of the law we signed almost exactly a year ago, the most significant investment in clean energy and combating the existential threat of climate change ever, anywhere in the world. Like I said, it's $368 billion.
And Governor Lujan Grisham is leading the way, launching New Mexico's community solar program so families will save money on electric bills; stopping leaks of superpolluting methane from oil and gas operationswe're capping thousands of those wells all across America, beginning in EasternWestern Pennsylvania and coming eastcoming west; and putting New Mexico on a path for a cleaner, cheaper electric transmission future as well in this State.
Folks, when I think jobswhen I think climate, I think jobs. I don't think all the dangersthere's real danger, but the jobs to fix the problemmy mother used to have an expression. After I lost my wife and daughter, she was trying to console me. She said, ""Joey, out of anything bad, something good will happen if you look hard enough for it."" Well, all across America, we're looking. There are going to bea lot of good things are going to happen as a consequence of this problem we're facing.
What Arcosa is doing here is part of a much broader clean energy manufacturing. It's going to happen in big cities and rural communities as well. Like in Colorado, where CS Wind broke ground on what will be the world's largest wind tower manufacturing plant.
And, coincidentally, CS Wind is Congresswoman Lauren Boebertyou know that very quiet Republican lady? [Laughter] It's in her district. Who, along with every other Republican, voted against this bill. And it's making all this possible. And she railed against its passage. But that's okay, she's welcoming it now.
When I ran for office, I promised to be President for all Americans. Whether you live in a blue State or a red State, I'm going to keep my promise.
Before we made these historic clean energy investments, Siemens Corporation laid off workers who were making wind turbine parts and put the plant in Iowa and Kansas into what they now callthey refer to as ""hibernation."" I hibernated in a whileayou know, Iowa for a while. But look, now they're reopening both these plants and rehiring workers.
In New York, GE is investing $50 million for a new manufacturing assembly line making critical components for turbines in partnership with organized labor.
Every one of these companies has pointed to the clean energy law that we originated and I signed as a reason for making these investments. And we're making sure rural communities are benefiting from these historic investments as well. It's not just urban areas.
We're investing over $160 million in New Mexico to support conservation and climate-smart agriculture and forestry, like improved water management or grazing livestock in ways that improve soil health, helping farmers and ranchers get paid for doing the right thing, planting material that absorbs carbon from the air and not justlook, we've launched the Rural Partners Network, placing Federal employees on the ground in New Mexico to help rural communities take advantage of the Federal resources. So they're there and canbecause this is all new stuff. People on the ground to say: ""Here's how you do it. This is what you do.""
Building an economy from the bottom up and the middle out means strengthening our rural economy so farmers and ranchers and their children don't have to leave home to find opportunities for work.
Where I come from, it's all about pride. It's all about restoring pride, being able to make a living in the community you love and where you were raised and not have to leave.
Folks, this is all part of my plan. The plan is to invest in America. We're transforming our country, including by rebuilding America's infrastructure.
We used to have the best infrastructure in the world. We were number one in the world. That's ports, railroads, airports, roads, everything. You know what we are now? We're number 13 in the world. China used to be number eight. Now they're number two.
How can you have the best economy in the world with a second-rate infrastructure? It's not possible.
And through the bipartisan infrastructure law, we already announced over 37,000 projects in 4,500 communities all across America, including $3.6 billion in investments right here in New Mexico. So far. We're just getting started.
For example, the city of Albuquerque is getting $25 million to rebuild the Uptown Transit Center, making it safer, more accessible, and easier for folks to get uptown and helping transform the area into a vibrant community hub.
We're investing $160 million in Eastern New Mexico Rural Water System to build a new transmission pipeline, providing a critical water supply to nearly 70,000 people, from Clovis to Portales to Cannonto, excuse me, Cannon Air Force Base.
Look, right now over 114,000 homes and small businesses across New Mexico don't have access to high-speed internet. We're investing over $1 billion in this State to connect every corner of this State, especially rural communities and family farms, with affordable internet.
So people sometimes say, ""Why are you doing that?"" Imagine if a long timeRoosevelt and the telephones came along and said, ""We're not going to help invest in telephones."" Come on, man. [Laughter] I don't know what the hell we're thinking.
Already, we're saving nearly 170,000 New Mexico families $30 a month on their internet bills so far. We're making investments like this all across the country.
I'll justif I could pause for another second. There is a distinguished Senator from the State of Alabama who used to be a pretty good football coach, and he's railed against this legislation. And then I noticed he had a big announcement: ""Alabama is going to get a billion two hundred million dollars for internet."" And I thought: ""Wait a minute. Didn't he rail against that for a long, long time?"" I was inclined to go down and help him celebrate, but I decided not to. [Laughter]
Look, we can see exactly where we're making these investments, and you can see exactly where they are if you go to invest.gov. You'll know exactly where every one of these investments is going throughout America.
These investments create thousands of good-paying jobs. And we're making sure workers have the skills to do the jobs. For example, in New Mexico, we're funding the mobile training unit run by the plumbers and pipefitters union, UA Local 412. It's going to train plumbers and pipefitters and HVAC workers with a focus on training Latino workers, Indigenous people, and people recovering from substance abuse.
And I know you're probably thinking what a lot of our very conservative Republican friends: ""Biden is spending all this money, man. My taxes are going to go up."" Unless you make more than $400,000 a year, your Federal taxes aren't going to go up a single penny.
And guess what? I did all this without raising anybody's taxes in the middle class. And one other little thing: During this process, I cut the Federal budget in 2 years by $1.7 trillion. One-point-seventhe largest anyone has ever done in 2 years. The last guy increased the national debt by 40 percent.
Folks, we've done all this without raising taxes on the middle class, and I promise we'll never raise Federal tax on anyone making less than $400,000 a year. I've kept that promise, and I'm going to keep it, unlike myunlike the last President.
And as I said, my first 2 years in office, the Federal deficit fell by $1.7 trillion.
Audience member. Thank you, Joe!
The President. And we got what we promised. We can cut the Federal deficit and still do all the rest of this.
Folks, every one of my friends on the other team in Congress voted against the clean energy investments. And the vast majority voted against the bipartisan infrastructure law. But that hasn't stopped them from claiming credit now that billions of dollars and thousands of jobs are coming into their States.
Like I said at the State of the Union Address, I'll see them at the groundbreakings. [Laughter]
Look, let me close with this. I'm not here to declare victory on the economy. We have a lot more work to do, but we have a plan, and it's turning things around. Bidenomics is just another way of saying: restore the American Dream.
Forty years of trickle-down economic policy limited the dream to those at the top. But I believe every American willing to work hard should be able to get a job no matter where they livein the heartland, small townsto raise their kids on a good paycheck and be able to keep their roots where they grew up.
My dad used to have a saying, and I mean this sincerelyhe'd say: ""Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your pride; it's about dignity."" And he meant it. Not a joke. It's about dignity. It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, ""Honey, it's going to be okay."" It's the being able to sayyou think I'm kidding, but Isome of yousome of the folks in Congress knew my dad. He meant it.
And he said: ""The real question, Joey, is, at the end of the month, is thereafter you pay all your bills, is there anyanything left? Do you have a little breathing roomjust a little bit of breathing room?""
Well, folks, that's part of the American Dream. And that's Bidenomics. It's rooted in what has always worked best in this country: investing in America, invest in Americans. Because when we invest in our people, when we strengthen the middle class, we have stronger economic growth that benefits everybodythe poor, the wealthy, everybody.
And for the longest time, we've been told to give up on American manufacturing, that it can't happen again, and we just can't do it anymore. Well, as you might have noticed, I've never believed that. As I said, America used to lead the world in manufacturing, and we're going to do it again.
I can honestly say I've never been more optimistic about America's future. Just remember who we are: We are the United States of America. And there is nothingnothing beyondI mean it sincerely. Think of any objective we've set as a goal that we've ever not met. Name one. No matter what it is, we've never, never, neverwhen we've worked togetherfailed. Nothing is beyond our capacity if we work together.
And God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you so much.

Joseph R. Biden, Remarks at the Arcosa Wind Towers, Inc., Manufacturing Facility in Belen, New Mexico Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/363973 "
2023-08-08 00:00:00,"Remarks at a Campaign Reception in Albuquerque, New Mexico","
The President. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Well, Randi, you know, it's a good thing you're not doing this overseas. Every time I go overseas, you know how many people have to travel with me? [Laughter] Nine hundred.
Audience members. Whoa!
The President. Andbut like you said, you and my wife agree: They're too damn nice lookingmost of them. That's what worries me. [Laughter]
But all kidding aside, thank you very much. Look, it's one thing to come to a fundraiser, which I truly appreciateto do a fundraiser. It's another thing to have one in your home, and it takes over everything. So thank you, thank you, thank you.
And, you know, the Governor has been a good friend since I got engaged in running. And she's done a hell of a job in the House, and she's done a hell of a job here as Governor. And we come from the same value set.
You know, I said I was running the first time for three reasons, even as my campaign staff thought it wasI was off base. The first one, I said I want to restore the soul of America, this sense of decency we used to have when Fred and I worked together. Fred, we used to argue like hellnot Fred and I.
And, by the way, I want to personally thank Fred Harris, because when I got elected[applause]thank youwhen I got elected as a kid in 1972, I thought the world had come to me. And I was down in Washington borrowing Teddy Kennedy's office, hiring staff. I wasn't old enough to be sworn in yet. You had to be 30 to be sworn in, and I was waiting to be constitutionally eligible. And I got a phone call saying my wife and daughter had just been killed, and my two boys weren't likely to make it.
And there were people who came to me, who surrounded meand I mean this sincerelythat gave me reason to stay. They saved my sanity. And that's not hyperbole.
A lot of you've been through as much or worse than I've been through. And I'm notI'm not talking about the death of it. But what peopleI didn't want to stay. I had called my sister, who managed my campaign, and my brother and said, ""We elected a Democratic Governor."" Remember, Fred? And we hadalready had 58 Democratic Senators. They didn'tit wasn't like they weren't going to have another Democrat replace me.
But a group of Senators, including Fred and about five others, just always were coming byjust come by the office, ""Why don't you just come to lunch with us?"" ""Why don't you""I wanted no part of it. I wanted to get in and out.
So, Fred, you are not only one of the toughest and smartest Senators I ever worked with, but you have a heart as big as your head, pal. Thank you. Thank you.
And speaking of big, you got yourself a Senator who looks like he could play tight end somewhere around here sitting down at the other end. Just don't jump in the pool right away. Okay? Hang on.
And, look, there's so many people here to thank. If I do that, I'll do the whole night. But I'm going to take a few more minutes to thank just a few more people.
You know, folks, one of the things thatwhen I said there isthe reasons that I ran, when I announced my running for the Presidency, is that I had no intention of running for President again. My son hadmy son Beau had just died because of Iraq. I didn't want any part of getting engaged. I was out of office. I was a full professor at the University of Pennsylvania. They gave me a $2 million staff. I had staff like Tony Blinken doing foreign policy with me and others. And I didn't want to run.
Andbut then remember what happened in Charlottesville? When those folks came out of the woods carrying torches, Nazi banners, singing the same anti-Semitic bile they sang in '33 and '34 in Germany, and accompanied by the Ku Klux Klan. And a young woman, whose mother I met, was killedwho was standing by and was killed.
And they asked the sitting President what he thought, and he said there was good people on both sides. That's when I decidedand many of you did, toothat you hadwe had to be engaged. This is a different deal. This is a different deal.
This is not about this upcoming election. This is about the past.
And so, we found ourselvesI concluded when I ranone of the things Fred and I agreed on when we were in the Senate was that, you know, trickle-down economics never worked much for my dad. My dad was a gentleman. His greatest regret he washe never he was extremely well read. And he had gonebeen accepted to John Hopkins. Couldn't do it. Anyway. To make a long story short, his greatest regret: He never went to college.
But my dad was one of those guys who worked like hell, never complained, and would always come home for dinner and then go back to work. But my dad was one of those guys whonothing much trickled down on his kitchen table. And he used to say: ""Joey""for real""a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about being able to look you kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay.'"" Not asking much. Just being aa clear shot.
And so the second reason I ran was to begin to rebuild this country and rebuild the middle class. Because when the middle class does well, the poor have a way up and the wealthy continue to do very well.
I'm a capitalist. If you can make a billion dollars, make it. If you can make a million dollars, make it. Just pay your taxes. Just pay your taxes.
And so the third reasonand you may remember I got roundly criticized for saying itwas I said, ""I want to unite the country."" For how can a participatory democracy function without unity, without being able to get along with one another? And the pressand the press is here tonight. The press legitimately was saying: Biden had that reputation when he was a Senator; he was able to bring people together.
And Iwe served with guys like Jesse Helms and Strom Thurmond and Jim Eastland. By the way, Jim Eastland once said to mewe were walking back from the Judiciary Committee one day. We were taking pictures a moment agoall of us. And I came around the corner and there was a group ofwell, I was walking with him back to his office from the Judiciary Committee meeting.
And all of a sudden, we turned the corner and there are about 10 people from Mississippi. And they don't ask to have their picture ""taken""; they want their picture ""made."" They said, ""Mr. Chairman! Mr. Chairman! Can I have my picture made with[inaudible]?"" Next thing you know, I'm in the picture.
And I went into his office with him. And he said, ""Joe, you all know those folks in Mississippi?"" And I said: ""No, I didn't. I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman. I didn't mean to be in the picture."" He said, ""Whenever you have your picture made with folks you don't know, always stand on the end."" He said, ""No body parts touching."" [Laughter] He said, ""Because that way, if they turn out bad, you can cut yourself out."" [Laughter]
Well, a lot of people are getting cut out these days. And it's a different place. Fred, I don't think you'd recognize it. It's a different place. Your two Senators here can tell you that.
And so one of the things that we are trying to do is, I decided that we were just going to go ahead and try to keep the commitments that I made.
And, you know Ben Ray has been a partner of mine for a long time. I don't know how we could get much we got done without Ben.
And your new Representative. She's doing one hell of a job. She's doing one hell of a job.
And Mayor Tim Keller and other elected officials here. Tim is going to be[applause]you're announcingI won'tI'm not going to jump but when are you going to make that announcement you talked to me about today? Is it Friday or
Mayor Timothy M. Keller of Albuquerque, NM. Friday.
The President. Friday. More good news coming, I believe.
And by the way, you know, I just came from your neighboring State of Arizona. And you're right, they do claim to have the largest Native American population. But I met with 15 Tribal leaders. And I had the opportunity to do something I wanted to do. I was able to dedicate 1 million acres of Tribal land back to the surrounding[applause]surrounding the Grand Canyon.
But look, folks, let me I'm going on too long here. Let me talk about whatyou know, a lot of you are the reason I got elected in the first place. That's not hyperbole. And I appreciate you taking a shot with me again.
I've never beenI've beenI know I'm only 35 years old. I know that. [Laughter] But I've never been more optimistic about America's chances than I am today. I mean that sincerely. Because we are, I truly believeand when I was deciding whether or not to run the last time, I started to write a book about the inflection points in history, where every couple of generations, things change in such a profound way that they're never going to go back to being the same. It could be better or worse, but they're fundamental changes.
And that's what's going on now. There's fundamental changes happening, whether it's global warming or the tundra melting andwhatever it is, there's just fundamental change taking place. And we have a chance to move it in the right directions if we're smart about it.
And so far, there's two things that we have to do. Take a look what's happening around the world. We found ourselves in a circumstance where wePutin isand it's starting to rain, so I'm going to make this real quick. [Laughter]
The bottom line is: The allegiances are changing around the world in a big way. And they're changing in terms of, for example, the idea that there was going to be a response to Putin's aggression in Ukraine was not likely. I've spent over 200 hours with the heads of state in the European countries, just holding it togetherI mean it sincerelykeeping all of NATO and the European Union solidly together so there was no cracks. Because Putin is convinced that if, in fact, he can break NATO, he breaks through, it changes the whole dynamic.
We're in a situation where we fundamentally changed that dynamic in Southeast Asia as well as in the Indian Ocean and theand that whole area. Because what we have now is, we put together a thing called the Quad. We havedid you ever think you'd have Japan, India, the United States, and Australia working as closely as we are?
Well, guess who wantsI'm going to be going to Vietnam shortly because Vietnam wants to change our relationship and become a partner.
We find ourselves in a situation where all of these changes around the world are taking place at a time we have an opportunity, if we're smart, to change the dynamic.
For example, I'm holding an event at Camp David with South Korea and Japan, together. They've had a rapprochement. So my point is: There's a lotthe countrythe world is ready. They're hungry. They know there's a need, and they're looking for leadership.
And one of the things that I'm convinced is trueour former Secretary of State used to say America is the essential nation. We are the essential nation. Not Joe Biden. When I walk into a room, everything changesnot because of Joe Biden, because I'm President of the United States of America. Not a joke.
And so[applause]we have an enormous opportunityenormous opportunityto change the dynamics in the world, if we're lucky and if we work like hell at it.
On the domestic side, you know, II'm going to make this even shorter. We've done, I think, pretty darn well. You know, my dad, as I said, used to say: ""A job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about pride.""
Well, when we decided to begin to build from the middle out and the bottom up, things began to change.
A few little statistics, which are thatand there's three kinds of lies, as Disraeli said, ""lies, damned lies, and statistics."" But, you know, thethe Economist and the Wall Street Journal, early on, started making fun of Bidenomics. Well, now they're[inaudible]praising Bidenomics. They don't know quite what to do with it.
By that, I mean we're building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up. We're establishing our leadership in the world. We're in a position wherethis Bidenomicswe've created 13 million jobs in 2 years. That's more than ever has occurred.
We created nearly 800,000 manufacturing jobs800,000. Unemployment rate is 3.5 percent. It's below that for the longest period in American history.
We're in a situation where inflation is the lowest in 2 yearsat 3 percentwhen it was 9 percent when we took over.
The point I'm making is that things are beginning to move. But one of the things we did was the American Rescue Plan. Well, you're right about what your Governor did, in terms of saving lives with COVID. We were able to reach out. And when we took office, there were only about 200,000 people who had been vaccinated. We changed that. We changed the entire nation.
Bipartisan infrastructure law: 37,000 projects already approved. And remember with Trump, it was going to bethere's going to be ""Infrastructure Month."" Well, it went on for 4 years. Now we have ""Infrastructure Decade,"" and we're putting a whole hell of a lot of union workers to work with good jobs.
And by the way, I met with the Business Roundtable. They said, ""Why are they calling you the most pro-union President in American history?"" I said, ""Because[inaudible]."" They said, ""Well, why are you?"" I said, ""Because you need them.""
Andbecause, you know, everybody thinks you become an electrician, you just show up and say, ""I want to be an electrician""if you've worked for 4 years as an apprentice to get there.
And so, things are changing. Attitudes are changing between corporate America and labor. Attitudes are changing across the board.
We also decided that myone of my passions since I've been insince the eighties was the environment. Well, we've put ourselves in a position where we passed the most comprehensive environmental piece ofit's called the ""Inflation Reduction Act."" It's within that. It has nothing to do with inflation; it has to do with the[inaudible]$4- $600excuse me, $368 billion, the single largest investment in climate change anywhere in the worldanywhereno one has ever, ever spent that. And it's beginning to take hold.
I hadI met in the back lawn of the White Housethe South Lawnwith all the automobile manufacturers. Guess what? At the time, remember, General Motors was suing California for having a higher standard on pollution, exhaust from tailpipes, than the Federal standard. And they said they couldn't do that.
Well, we had a talk with Mary Barra and others, the chairman of the company, and they changed their mind. They all came to me and said, ""We're going to go totally electric by 2035 and 50-percent electric by '33. That's going to change[applause]billionsI mean billions of tons of CO2.
We're in a position where we're changing the nature and way in which we deal with so many other things relating to the environment.
And I just came, as I said, from your neighboring State. There's a lot going on there and all around the world. We're making significant progress.
We're in a situation where we've employed more people than any other nation in the world. We're making other nationsand, by the way, all thisand I'm doing this quicklyand I apologize because I think you're going to get wet.
Butwell, here's the deal: You know, they said, ""Well, Biden is a big spender; things are going ongoing to be going back""guess what? When Trump left office, he increased the Federal deficit 235 years by 40 percent. My first 2 years, I've reduced the deficit by 1 trillion 700 billion dollars[inaudible].
And I made a commitment: No one making less than $400,000 are going to see a penny in Federal taxes going up as long as I'm President of the United States.
But the flip of this isalso[inaudible], weyou know, we used to have in Americabefore the pandemic started, we had 749 billionaires. We now have a thousand. You know what the average rate of Federal tax they pay: 8.3 percent. That ain't fair. That ain't fair. I don't want them paying 80 percent. I don't even wantjust want them paying the top rate. That's it. It's in the thirties, not thenot the eighties.
And we fundamentally can change the way things wasthings work. And I think you're even seeing the business community
By the way, I know a few things about corporate America. I come from a corporate State of the world. Delaware has more corporations incorporated in the State of Delaware than every other State in the Union combinedcombinedevery single solitary one.
So my point is: There's so many opportunities, and people are open to the change. They're open to change. And so what we have to do is just keep our head down and keep moving, in my view.
And one of the things we've donefor example, weI decided tothatyou know, there's a provision in a 1934 law saying that any Federal funds spent by the President of the United States should be made in America andwell as by American personnel. Well, guess what? No President, Democrat or Republican, paid much attention to it. Well, I have.
Well, guess what? That's the reason why we have so much employment going on. We'rewe're bringingfor example, we invented the computer chipit was about the size of the little tip of my finger. And guess what? We used to have 40 percent of the market. We invented it; we made itwe made it work.
Well, guess what? We now have convinced over $450 billion in outside investment building these fabsthese great, big things that are the size of football fields that build these computer chips.
Guess what? The average salary in those fabs is 115,000 bucks. And guess what? You don't need a college degree to be there. You don't need a college degree.
So the other thing we're doing: We're trying to restore pride to the[inaudible]. Those of you who come from places that areI'm going to stop. You guys are going to get soaking wet. [Laughter]
Look, I think that we have to understand that people have aI was born and raised and my family is from Scranton, Pennsylvania. When coal died, everything died, including the pride of the citythe pride of the city. Everybody is from Scranton; no one is in Scranton.
And so, what's happening is all these factories we're going to be building and more construction than any time in modern American history. We're bringing back pride toand I made a commitment: I represent red States the same way I represent blue States and make no distinction.
And guess what? That factory that your father and your grandfather worked at that employed 2,000 people in townin a small town in the Midwestthat gave people pride, whenwhen it shut down, everything shut down. Everything shut down.
How many of you know friends from the Midwest who gotwhotheir parents were told: ""Mom, Dad, I can't stay. There's no jobs. I've got to leave."" You should be able to stay and work where you live.
And so we'rethere are all these factories that are opening up across the country. And they're investing billions of dollars in these factories. Up in Rochester, New Yorkanyway, it's a significant changesignificant change that's underway, if we're conscious of what we're doing and if we're completely, thoroughly honest with the American public about what's going on.
And so, folks, I'm trying to think how to get to the end here real quickly. [Laughter]
Thelook, you know, there's two ways to deal with inflation: try to bring it down by the traditional way and what the Fed is doing and what we're doing, et cetera. But, also, there's another way. It'smy dad used to say: ""How much money do you have after you got your monthly paychecks and you've paid all your bills? Do you have any breathing room left? Is there anything left?""
One of the ways to reduce inflation isanybody you knowI'm not asking you to say yourself, but anybody know anybody with type 1 or type 2 diabetes? You need insulin. Well, guess what? It's between $4- and $800 a month, depending on what you need.
I was in Southern VirginiaI was in Northern Virginia at a town meeting, and a woman stood up. Sheand she said: ""I'm a middle-class person. We have insurance but don't have enough insurance to cover my two daughters. Both of them need insulin. And what we do is we cut it in half."" Wewell, guess what? You know how much it costs for the drug companies to make that insulin? Ten dollars and twenty cents. To package it: total $13. Charging $4- to $800 makes no sense. And guess what? It'sit's American taxpayers paying for it because the Medicare is paying for this.
So I didgot itwe got a little negotiation. If you areand God forbid, I hope you don't need itbut if you need insulin, you're paying now fifty $35 a month to make you[applause]becauseand, by the way, it's saving the taxpayers billions of dollarsbillions of dollars.
And so, for example, beginning in 2024, no matter how manyno matter what your bills are, if you hadand some of theand some of you, like me, understand thethe ravages of cancer and the cost of the drugs. I don't have cancer, but family members.
And guess what? You know, some of these drugs cost anywhere from $8- to $9,000 a year. Well, beginning in 2024, your total drug cost, if you're on Medicare, will not exceed $2,000, no matter what it is.
And so there is a lot of things we can do to restore some pride and dignity to people. It's all about dignity. It's all about being able to look your kid in the eye. It's all about being able to just hold your head high and say: ""You know, II'm doing my best. I have a shot."" And just giving people a shot.
And it's nothing really radical, but it's working. And I think it's going to continue to work.
Folks, you know, we're in a situation where we are now down tolet me conclude by saying it's basically resilience.
You know, when we talk about the environment, we're talking about the things that can fundamentally change how we live. Fundamentally changeone of the hardest things to get through is we're going to spend over 1 trillion 300 billion dollars on the infrastructure over the next 10 years. And we're going to spend a significant amount of moneyalmost $368 billion on the environment and still be able to pay for it.
But here is the deal: In the process of doing that, we've got to be in a position to be able to show people what we've done. And so, although personal ratings are high, when the economywe're runningthe idea we're running in the midforties doesn't seem too consistent.
The more you readI'm going say something self-serving sounding, at least. Most Presidential historians are giving me enormous credit for saying I've got more done in 2 years than any President since Roosevelt. But it doesn'tno, no, no. It doesn't show. It takes time for people to realize why that's there.
In communities, for exampleI'll end with this. Philadelphia, there was aon the beltway going through Philadelphia, there was aon 95 north and south, 40140,000 cars traveled over this one small bridge in Philadelphia and 40,000 trucks. Well, a guy going underneath the bridge knocked down the pillars, the bridge fell down, everything stopped.
It would have ordinarily taken somewhere between 6 and 9 months. I got it done in 5 daysf-i-v-e days. Because we can. We had the capacity to do it. Not just[inaudible]we had the capacity and the will to do it. Labor was all in. Everyone was working together.
But in addition to that, we found ourselves in a situation where the Roosevelt Expressway had to be changed. A hundred and nine people dead because of thehow dangerous that expressway is in the curves. Well, we're going to change it.
And people are starting to say in the Philadelphia market, ""God, Biden did thisBiden's proposal did this?""
Well, they're beginning to realize what we've actually passed is having an impact. And so it's going to take a little while, but I don't care whether it does or not as long as it gets doneas long as it gets done.
We have a lot we can do. We're going to get it done. And asyou know, as myevery time I'd walked out of my Grandfather Finnegan's house, my grandpop up in Scranton was ahe was first-generation Irish American. And hewell, let me put it this way: Irish Catholics weren't at the top of the list in Northeast Pennsylvania in the mines.
Matter of fact, one of the great disappointments was we had an uncle who wasturns out to be mining engineer and four of them worked earlier in the mines. And one was accused when he ranmy great-great-grandfather was only the second Irish Catholic ever elected in the State of Pennsylvania to the State Senate. Andand when he passed awaywhen he was running, they were accusing him of having been a Molly Maguire.
Do you know what a Molly McGuire was? Molly McGuire was one of those folks who when thewerewhen the Irish were so badly mistreated in the mines, they had a group of thesebasically Irish thugs called Molly Maguires. What they would do is they'd find the people abusing the workers, kill them, and drop them on their doorstep.
Well, the whole family was so disappointed to find out he wasn't a Molly Maguire. [Laughter]
But all kidding aside, things are changingchange rapidly. And as things fell apart, people still stuck together. But there's much more we have to do.
But every time I'd walk out of my grandpop's house, he'd look at me and he'd yell, ""Joey""myand heby the way, he went to Santa Clara out hereout of California, was an All-American football player in 1906, went back, was a newspaper guy in the business side, had four sons and a daughtermy mom.
Andbut every time he'd walk out the door, he'd yell, ""Joey, keep the faith."" And my grandmother would go: ""No, Joey. Spread it.""
Let's go spread the faith. Thank you.

Thank you, thank you. Please have a seat if you have one. If you don't have one, you can sit down anyway if you want. [Laughter]
Well, thank you very, very much. Maya, thank you for the introduction. When I was your age, to be able to stand up and introduce anybody, let alone a President, I would have frozen. Thank you. You're an impressive young woman. And I'm going to come down to those waterfalls pretty soon.
It's great to be here with Secretary Haaland, our first Native American Cabinet Secretary, and Brenda Mallory, the Chair of our Council of Environmental Quality.
And, Governor Hobbs, congratulations, and you're doing a heck of a job.
And Senator Kyrsten Sinema and Congressmanwhere is the Congressman? Is he here? Therewe've been hanging out since I got here a little bit. Ral has been a good friend and done a great deal. He's one of the most popular Congressmen in the country, I think. Who have long championed this effort in Congress. And Congressman Greg Stanton has been a leader inas well.
And thanks to all the State, county, and local officials who've worked so hard to see this day happen, make it happen. And you have. Believe me, I know you have.
To the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management professionals here, thank you. Thank you for caring for our public lands, the most precious thing we have.
And special thanks to Tribal leaders joining us, whose ancestors stewarded these lands since time immemorial. Got to meet most of you last night. I'm looking forward to saying hello to you again today.
And a special hello to Jimmy McCain. Where are you, Jimmy? I'm going to embarrass you. He didn't knowthink he was going to be introduced. Where isthere you are, Jimmy.
JimmyJimmy's dad was a dear friend of mine. We were like two brothers whowe got along together. When we argued, we argued like hell. We really went at it. But he was a man ofhe was a great patriot and a man of enormous integrity. And, Jimmy, you're just like your dad: serving your country in Iraq and Afghanistan and continuing to serve as a second lieutenant in the United States Army. Thank you, thank you, thank you, pal.
And I say this with all sincerityno one ever doubts that I mean what I say; sometimes I say all that I mean though[laughter]I think of your dad all the time, about how much he loved this country and how optimistic he was, optimistic about our future. So thank you for being here, pal, and thank you for your continued service.
America's natural wonders are our Nation's heart and soul. That's not hyperbole; that's a fact. They unite us. They inspire us. A birthright we pass down from generation to generation. And that's why from day one I've taken historic steps to conserve our natural treasures for all ages.
My first week as President, I signed an Executive order establishing our country's most ambitious conservation goal ever. I made a commitment that we will protect 30 percent of all our Nation's lands and watersconserve all30 percent of all our Nation's lands and waters by 2030. And we're on our way. And we're delivering.
Just my first year in office, we've done moreprotected more lands than anythan anyone since the 1960s, John Kennedy's era: 9 million acres in Alaska, in Bristol Bay and the Tongass Forest; 225,000 acres in Minnesota, the Boundary Waters.
We're working to protect 770,000 square miles in the Pacific Ocean southwest of Hawaii: a new maritime sanctuarya network of islands and reefs almost three times the size of Texason track to be among the largest protected ocean area on the entire planet.
We've already restored protections for three national monuments gutted by the last administration, two not so far from here in Utah: the Grand Staircase and Bears Ears.
By the way, I'll never forget: I was standing in Washington, and a little girl walked up. And I could see her daddy say, ""Go up and say something to the President."" She walked up, and she said, ""Mr. President, would you take care of Bears Ears for me?"" And I didn't know what she meant when she said it: ""Would you take care of Bears Ears for me?"" Well, we took care of her, and we gave her the signing pen. [Laughter]
A third of the coast of New England in the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts.
Look, we've designated new national monuments as well: Camp Hale in Colorado, 50,000 acres; Spirit Mountain in Nevada, 500,000 acres; Castner Range in Texas, 6,600 acres; and just last month, honoring Emmett Till and his mother Mamie Till-Mobley in Mississippi and in Illinois. But[applause]folks, it's not hyperbole to suggest that there is no national treasurenonethat is grander than the Grand Canyon. The Grand Canyon, one of the Earth's nine wonderswonders of the world, literally. Think of that. You know, it's amazing. An enduring symbol of America to the entire world.
The first time I saw the Grand Canyon, years ago, I was a young Senator. As I stood there and looked out, a phrase came to mind. It was instinctive. I said this must bethis is God's cathedral. That's what it reminded me of. It just is so magnificent. As a matter of factI said nineit's one of the seven wonders of the world.
And so today I'm proud to use my authority under the Antiquities Act to protect 1almost 1 million acres of public land around Grand Canyon National Park as a new national monument[applause]to help right the wrongs of the past and conserve this land of ancestral footprints for all future generations.
Over the years, hundreds of millions of people have traveled to the Grand Canyon, awedawedby its majesty. But fewer are aware of its full history.
From time immemorial, more than a dozen Tribal nations have lived, gathered, prayed on these lands. But some 100 years ago, they were forced out.
That very act of preserving the Grand Canyon as a national park was used to deny Indigenous people full access to their homelands, to the places where they hunted, gathered. Took precious, sacred ancestral sites.
They fought for decades to be able to return to these lands, to protect these lands from mining and development, to clear them of contamination, to preserve their shared legacy for future generations.
I made a commitment as President to prioritize respect for the Tribal sovereignty and self-determination, to honor the solemn promises the United States made to Tribal nations to fulfill Federal trust and treaty obligations. I've pledged to keep using all that available authority to protect sacred Tribal lands. My administration has worked alongside Tribal leaders, including many of you who are here today, to keep that promise.
At a timeat a time when some seek to ban books and bury history, we're making it clear that we can't just choose to learn only what we want to know. We should learn everything that's good, bad, and the truth about who we are as a nation. That's what great nations do, and we are the greatest of all nations.
Only with truth comes healing and justice and another step toward forming a more perfect Union.
Folks, our Nation's history is etched in our people and in our lands. Today's action is going to protect and preserve that history along with these high plateaus and deep canyons, majestic red cliffs over 300 million years oldolder than the oldest dinosaur ever known; central to the creation stories of so many Tribal people and so many Tribal nations; fundamental to who we are, to their way of life, to their most sacred ceremonies. Ancestors buried here, eternal sources of reverence and healing.
These lands also support a range of ecosystems and plants, from savannas to sagebrush to ponderosa pine. A haven of hironic [iconic; White House correction] species like bats, bison, bighorn sheep, and nearly 450 kinds of birds, including the bald and golden eagles.
They are the historic home of 3,000 cultural sitescliff houses, cave paintingsancient spots that help us understand the history of these civilizations.
They also are key to building resilience to drought and climate change. Creeks and streams flowing into the Colorado River, supporting farms and ranches across the Southwest and bringing clean water to 40 million Americans.
And by creating this monument, we're setting aside new spaces for families to hike, bike, hunt, fish, and camp, growing the tourism economy that already accounts for 11 percent of all Arizona jobs.
Folks, preserving these lands is good not only for Arizona, but for the planet. It's good for the economy. It's good for the soul of the Nation. And I believe with my corein my core it's the right thing to do.
But there's more work ahead to combat the existential threat of climate change. You know, we've seen historic floods, more intense droughts, wildfires spreading smoky haze, which you couldI could sense todaythousands of miles. Record temperatures affecting more than 100 million Americans this summer. Over a hundredI need not tell you allover 110 degrees in Phoenix for 31 straight days.
You know, our extreme heat is America's number-one weather-related killer. Extreme heat kills more people than floods, hurricanes, and tornadoes combined. And it's threatening the farms, the forests, and the fisheries ofso many families depend on to make a living.
But none of this need be inevitable. From the start of my administration, we've taken an unprecedented action to combat climate crisis.
Last year, I signed the largest climate bill in the history not only of the United States, but literally in the history of the world. It's the biggest investment in climate conservation and environmental justice ever, anywhere, in the history of the world.
And it has many parts. For example, it will save working families thousands of dollars a year if they install rooftop solar or weatherize their homes and also conserve energy.
And it includes a record $720 million for Native communities to ease the impact of droughts and rising sea levels, to bring clean electricity to Tribal homes.
In all, these historic measures put us on track to cut all American emissions in halfin halfby 2030, and we're well on our way. It also creates enormous employment, enormous growth in things that better people's lives.
My mom, God love her, had an expression when I lost my family. She said, ""Joey, out of everything bad, something good will come if you look hard enough for it."" Well, there's a lot of good that's going to come from the sacrifices of dealing with taking on the climate crisis.
Folks, these are investments in our planet, our people, in America itself: protecting our outdoor treasures, making our Nation more resilient.
But some MAGA extremists in Congress are trying to undo it all. I didn't get any help from the guys on the other team. Every single, solitary person voted against this historic clean energy investment. And now many of them are trying again to repeal these parts of the bills, but we won't let them. There's too much at stake.
Let me close with this. America's natural wonders are central to our heritage and our identity as a nation. Conserving them not only protects the livelihoods of the people who depend on them, it preserves key pieces of our history, of the full American story, for generations to come. It unites us through all ages and connects us to something bigger than ourselvesmuch bigger than ourselves.
Today marks an historic step in preserving the majesty of this place. First among American landmarks. Sacred to Tribal Nations. Revered by every American. It speaks to the soul of our Nation. It reminds us of who we are.
And we can'twe are the United States of America. And there is nothingnothingbeyond our capacity when we act together. Nothing. Nothing at all.
And, folks, God bless you all. May God protects our troops.
Now I want to invite some of our guests on stageI think they know who they arewho are supposed to come upas I sign the proclamation establishing the Ancestral Footprints of the Grand Canyon National Monument.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[At this point, the President moved to the signing desk.]
I wonder who is going to be the first one to walk the million acres. The Secretary says she's sure many people have done it already.
All right, here we go.
[The President signed the proclamation.]
It's official.

Audience member. We love you, Joe! 
The President. At least I used to play center field. [Laughter]
Well, I'll tell you what: If you gave me a choice of standing here or on that riser, I'm not sure which I'd pick. [Laughter]
Welcome, guys. Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome. And I want to welcome to the White House the 2022 World Series Champions, the Houston Astros.
From team owner Jim Crane to manager Dusty Bakera name known to many of youto the players and everyone in the organization, it's great to have you here. It really is great to have you here.
And it's great to see so many of your fans, including the Second Gentleman and Representative Al GreenRandall Weber. Wherewhere's Al? Is Al here? There you are. I'm making sure I can see you, Al. Ibecause, I know, if I don'tsee, if he doesn't see me, that cane hurts. [Laughter]
Representative Alexander N. Green. We'll be back next year, Mr. President.
The President. And Randall Weberwhere is Randall?
Audience member. Right here.
The President. Oh, there you go, Randall. [Inaudible]
Representative Randy K. Weber, Sr. We will be back next year. [Inaudible]
The President. I tell youand if you want anybody, you want Sheila Jackson Lee on your team because you don't want to be on the opposite side of her.
Representative Shelia Jackson Lee. [Inaudible]
The President. You're playing every minute, I tell you. Lookwho has the distinction of representing Minute Maid Park, home of the Astros, by the way.
The Houston Astros: legends of Space City. The legends of Space City. Now, you know, a hundred years from now, they'll wonder what the hell that was: the Space City. [Laughter]
A hundred and six regular season wins, the best American League in the seasonthe best season in theof thein the American League. Twenty-one shutouts of opposing teams, the most in the entire league, including the postseason.
Swept the Mariners, the Yankees in the American League playoffs. And then, although I love these guys, this next part is hard to say[laughter]then they beat the Phillies in six games to win the World Series. Now, you all realize that means I can't go back to Philly, you know. [Laughter] Oh, I kid.
Look, led by World Series MVPwhere is Jeremy? Jeremyraise your hand so everybody sees youPea. The first rookie position player to earn the honor. Firstfirst, first. Led by five All-Stars, as well as a group of pitchers who pitched the first combined no-hitter in postseason history.
And you guys just weren't satisfied winning the World Series, man, you had to break every record.
I tell you, remarkable achievements led byand this is not hyperbolethe legendary Dusty Baker. Worst part about it is, I remember rooting for him as a kid, and I was older than he was. [Laughter] Geez.
[At this point, the President made the sign of the cross.]
[Laughter] Dusty, it wasn't easy. People counted you out, saying you were past your prime. Hell, I know something about that. [Laughter] I know something about that. [Laughter]
Dusty, a former marine and a man of faith who has never given up, with a record to prove it. An All-Star player, three-timethree-timeManager of the Year, the first coach to lead five teams to postseason in all of baseball history, and finally, World Series champion as a player and a manager.
There were plenty of folks rooting for the Astros, but the whole country was rooting for Dusty Baker, I promise you that. The whole country.
Look, and this team didn't just step up on the field, you stepped up for the community. I think I was mentioning this to the guys a littlea few minutes earlier. You focused on issues that are near and dear to my heartI mean that sincerelylike raising awareness on domestic violence.
You know, I spent a lot of my career writing the Violence Against Women Act. I think the onlymy dad used to have an expression that the ideathe ideathat the abuse of powerany man that raised his hand to a woman is just a frigging coward.
And you know, your support for kids with cancer. Me and my family and many families in America, that cuts very personally. And we started up the Biden Cancer Initiative and the Cancer Moonshot. We brought researchers, nonprofits, advocates, patients to end cancer as we know it, including pediatric cancer, which is often not researched.
You know, then, during terrible winter of 2021, you stepped up helping those most in need. And it matters. Don't under estimate it, guys. It's an American thing to do. You showed up for the people of Uvalde when they needed it most. I spent a lot of time in Uvalde, met every single family. I made sure I met every single, solitary family and spent time with them.
And I don't know
[The President gestured toward the teleprompter.]
You know, I don't know what they're doing with that machine. I mean, they're just rolling along here.
But the point is, theyou know, I think you athletes underestimate how much hope you give. Not a joke. I'm not beingthis is not hyperbole. I give you my word.
Every one of those kidsand when you guys decidedthe men who decided to roll up and take 300 of these kids and their families to the ballgame, it gave them a little bit of hope.
Well, some of you have suffered loss in your life. You understand it. It's astounding what you do. I really mean it. And it meant a great deal. Ione of the reasons why I like you guys so damn much. You know, the community was devastated. And you guysmy dad used to say, ""Half of winning is showing up."" You showed up.
You spent time with the surviving students. You gave them hope. You played ball in the park with them. You signed jerseys with their names of the children that were lost on it. I mean, it reallyit validates in ways I don't think you really understand.
You hosted a ""Uvalde Storm Day""""Strong Day."" And, as I said, 3,000 Uvalde residentsprovided buses to bring them to the game. You guys are the real deal.
And the victim's sister, Faith Mata, whose sister Tess was killed, threw out the ceremonial first pitch. Imagine what it was like for her standing on that moundor standing near it. Imagine what it was like and what it did. It really matters, I promise you. I promise you.
And this team said to the community that day: ""You're family. You're neighbors. We want to do whatever we can to help you get through this process. And if it's just a smile on a Sunday for our game, that's what we want to do."" That's what you did. You did a whole lot more.
Yes, sports is about winning. But it's a lot more than that. At best, it lifts people up, it brings them together, it helps them be there for each other.
I was honored to host the 2022 Houston Astros2022 Houston Astros here at the White House.
And by the way, congratulations. [Laughter] I didn't botherI didn't even say that part yet. [Laughter] But noI've done a lot of these. You're an impressive group of men. I mean, you really are. From management on downto ownership. I mean, you care.
And Ithis is not part of the program here, guys, but I'll bet you, you were surprised theirit gave you heart to see the reaction that people had to those kids when you took them out on the field. It matters. So thank you, thank you, thank you.
And folks, let me end by saying God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.
Thank you, thank you.
With that, I'm going to bring out the guytotally unknown to all of youJim Crane, to say a few words. [Laughter]
Owner and Chairman James R. Crane. Mr. President, First Lady, on behalf of my familyI've got most of my crew here todayand the entire
The President. That James?
Mr. Crane. Yes, that's Big Jamesand the entire Houston organization, thank you for having us atat this afternoon here. It's a great honor. And we appreciate the hospitality. The staff has been great, very welcoming. And I'd like to thank them.
And today is a special day. It's not only for the playerthese great players and coaches work hard every day. But we have a lot of our people. We've got some announcers in here. I parked car withcars with that guy when I was 16 in St. Louis.
The President. Oh, is that right?
Mr. Crane. We're still parking cars. [Laughter]
And so the whole organization pitches in. I don't think everybody realizes how hard everyone works, from the announcers, guys cleaning the stadium. All those jobs are very important. And it really helped us win 2022. It was a very, verya team effort from these great players and our entire group here today. And I appreciate everybody coming up today.
We're here representing the city of Houston. We have some politicians over there we know very well. And thank you for the great support.
But we have the best fans in baseball. And we want to thank our fans. Without the fansI tell everybody the fans pay the bills. [Laughter] They pay the salaries. I'm just a little conduit. [Laughter] And we wouldn't be here without all that support.
The other thing: We were lucky to pick off Dusty a few years ago, and Dusty has an unbelievable career. Everyone knows that. But this year, he won a World Series. He hadn't won a World Series, believe it or not.
The President. Played in one. [Laughter]
Mr. Crane. And I'm happy to turn it over to him. And I'm proud to have Dusty as our manager.
Manager Johnnie B. ""Dusty"" Baker, Jr. Thank you. [Laughter] Well, thanks, Jim. Good afternoon. And we're honored to be here today to represent the city of Houston and this organization.
President Biden, First Lady Dr. Biden, and your team, we thank you for inviting us to this celebration of our championship. These guys deserve it. And we thank you for the hospitality.
These guys standing behind me are the greatest guys that I've been around. They always believed in themselves. They always believed in themselves, prior to me even coming here, that they had the ability to win. And they show what perseverance and character can do for you.
I have these readings every day that I read. And that was abouttoday was perseverance. And perseverance has been, you know, the biggest part of my life. And perseverance has been the biggest part of these guys' life, or else you can't make it to the promised land like we did.
These guys, you know, were a group of veterans alongside some incredible young men who stepped into big shoes and made big plays for the biggest stage. We all know baseball is a long season, and they came to play every day. That's what we talk about all the time.
They were consistent in their personalities and confidence, and they had each other with unwavering support for each other and love for each other. I mean, I think that is probably one of the biggest things that this team has, compared to other teams that I've been in the past, is that they genuinely loved each other.
And when I asked the late Bill Russell what was the keys to the Celtics, whowhom I didn't like very well, he told me[laughter]he told me that they loved each other.
Twenty twenty-two was never about one individual. It was about a group of men coming together to accomplish something very special for this city that supported them. I love them all. You've got to love each and every one of them. And it's only a way to come together in a special feeling that is tough to describe and hard to repeat. But we play on repeating exactly that feeling.
Houston is a great city, with great people and great fans. Hands down, they're the best baseball fans in America, and we couldn't have done it without their support. I said the night we won that if we won one, we'd win two. And so now I've got to keep my word. I like keeping my word. [Laughter]
And we're in the middle of making it happen right now, coming off a great series in New York heading into a big series in Baltimore, probably the biggest series that Baltimore has had in a while, but[laughter]. Hey, I'm known to be honest, you know. No harm intended.
And you know, thank you, Mr. President and your staff, for having us here today. It's an honor.
And I'm going to throw it back to Jim to present a special gift to Mr. President. Thank you.

2023-07-28 00:00:00,"Remarks on Signing an Executive Order on Manufacturing Promotion Efforts in Auburn, Maine","
Kathie, thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
And to the Governor and the congressional delegation, the mayors, thank you, thank you, thank you.
Governor Janet Mills, you're doing a great job for the people of Maine.
And my good friend and great partner and a tireless fighter for good jobs, Senator Angus King isincluding it right here in Auburn Manufacturing.
Representative Cherrel [Chellie; White House correction] Pingree, a champion of farmers and workers, the environment, and a great friend.
And Representative Jared Golden, whose greatest claim to fame is the beautiful wife and little daughter I just met. [Laughter] An independent voice for the people of Maine, you serve the district just like you served your country as a marine, with integrity, honor, and fearlessness. Thank you.
And by the way[applause]. By the way, he also fought hard for delivering funding on several airports in his district. I wonder how he got that money. [Laughter] You doyou're doing a great job, pal.
And thanks to all the State legislation and local officials here today. And I know you've been hit hard by flooding. And FEMA Administrator Criswell has been working closely with you onin terms of the ground teams that we haveto get what you need. And we're not going away until everything is back. It's Build Back Better, not just build back to where it was, but better, because the environment has changed an awful lot.
I'm here to talk to you about what we're doing to bring manufacturing back to America, about our progress in building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down.
Yesterday we learned the economy grew faster than expected last quarter. And this morning we saw data showing that last month the annual rate of inflation continued to decline. So inflation is now at its lowest point in 2 years.
And wages are up after being adjusted for inflation.
When I came to office, I was determineddeterminedto end the trickle-down economyexcuse me, this little stand is out.
[At this point, the President attempted to move the podium riser out of the way with his foot.]
But I'll make sure I don't trip over it. Maybe if I stand on it, I'll make myself 3 inches taller. [Laughter]
I came to office determineddeterminedto move from a trickle-down economics that everyone from the Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal and thehas called Bidenomics. But the plan is working: building from the bottom up and the middle out.
Folks, you know, all that trickle-down stuffwhen the wealthy do very well, we all do wellwell, my dad was an honorable man. My dad worked like the devil. A real gentleman. But not a whole lot ever trickled down on our kitchen table if you're middle class folks. I didn't get much.
According to Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, it's leading to a boom in manufacturing, what we're doing. We've created over 13 million new jobs, more than before the pandemic. Nearly 28,700 here in Maine. Eight hundred thousand new manufacturing jobs nationwide. We've attracted almost a half a billion dollarshalf a trillion dollars in outside private investment to grow the economy, because they know it's available now.
That's more jobs in 2 years than have created by any President in a 4-year term.
Unemployment in America has been below 4 percent for the longest stretch in over 50 years. And it's not just that we've recovered all the jobs we lost during the pandemic. It's that we now have more jobs than we did before the pandemic.
And because unemployment has been so low for so long, workers that have been left behind for decades aren't just finding jobsmore jobs, they're finding better jobs with higher pay. And no wonder: Job satisfaction, according to all the measures, is at a 36-year high.
The share of working-age Americans in the workforce is as high as it's been in 20 years, including during every single day my predecessor was President. Remember we hadthey were going to have that ""Infrastructure Week""? Anyway, long story. [Laughter]
People are coming off the sidelines. Unemployment is down, but so is inflation. Remember, the experts told me, in total, allbut to get inflation under controland I love this as a middle class guywe had to lower wages and had to have higher unemploymentonly way to get inflation down. Well, maybe if we get the excess profits of corporate America down, we lower it.
But I've never thought the problem was too many people or that working people were making too much money. We now know a big part of the reason for inflation was the pandemic, the war in Ukraine, broken supply chains, and excess profits, all hitting pocketbooks hard while paddlingwhile padding corporate profits.
By the way, I'm not against corporations. I come from the corporate capital of the world: Delaware. No, seriously. More corporations are incorporated in my State than every other State in the Union combined. But they should pay their fair share.
When the pandemic hit, all of a sudden, we couldn't get those little computer chips, about the size of the tip of my little finger. Well, guess what? You need about 300 of them to build an automobile. Guess what? And I can go on and on and on. We had tracked itwe had tracked itover $300 billion and people coming to America to build those factoriesthose factories now here in America.
I decided we're never going to be in a position we don'twe're not at the beginning of the supply chaina phrase I don't think any of us really heard until 3 years ago.
So we went to work getting our economy back on track fixing those supply chains. We've made a lot of progress.
Now one reason we have inflation fall by two-thirds without losing jobs is that we're seeing corporate profits start to fall as well. We have more to do, but I like what I said: Inflation is now at the lowest point it's been in over 2 years.
In fact, we have the lowest rate of inflation among the world's major economies. Every major economy in the world, our inflation rate is lower. We're growing faster. We're economically more advanced than every other major country in the world. It's down from 9 percent to 3 percent, and it's going to continue to go down.
While there is more work ahead, earlier this week, the Washington Post suggested Republicans may have to find something else to criticize me for[laughter]now that inflation is coming down. Maybe they'll decide to impeach me because it's coming down. I don't know. I love that one. Well, anyway, that's another story. [Laughter]
At the same time, pay for low-wage workers has grown at the fastest pace in over two decades, and wages are growing faster than inflation. That means an awful lot to working people where I come from; they have more money in their pockets than they did before.
My dad used to say, ""At the end of the month, the question is: Do you just have a littleafter you pay all your bills, do you have just a little breathing rooma little breathing room, a little left over?"" Folks, that's Bidenomics. It's about growing the economy and strengthening the middle class, making things in America again.
Under trickle-down economics, it didn't matter where companies made things, as long as it helped their bottom line, even if that meant jobs and supply chains moved overseas.
What did most of these guys do? They decided to send the jobs overseas where the labor was cheaper and bring the product made back to the United States more expensive. Entire towns and communities got hollowed out not just here in Maine, but all across America. This is not just for Maine, this is all of America. Small towns and medium-sized towns all across America factories got shut down.
All over the country, parents saying to their children: ""Honey, I'm sorry. I lost my job. We can't live here anymore.""
You saw it here in Maine. Let me remind you of a few examples: Auburn and Lewiston, right next door, used to be home to some of the country's largest textile mills. Bates Manufacturing was the largest employer in Maine with thousands of employees supplying the country with high-quality cloth and quilts.
Bates Manufacturing survived the Civil War, the Great Depression, and two World Wars. But in the 1990s, American textile production moved overseas, and Bates closed shop. And by the way, my State used to be a gigantic producer of textile, the DuPont Company.
The same thing happened with Maine's iconic paper industrythe same thing happened. The industry lost 8,000 jobs over the past two decades as paper mills shut their doors.
Take the Verso mill in Bucksexcuse me, Bucksport. Founded in 1829 [1929; White House correction]. Provided generations of good jobs and up to 40 percent47 percent of the town's tax revenue. A decade ago, it closed down, devastating the town, like so many thousands of towns all across America.
Between 1990 and 2010, Maine lost nearly 45,000 manufacturing jobs. And like we saw across the country, once-thriving cities and towns became shadows of what they used to be. And when these towns were hollowed out, something else was lost as well. And I come from Northeast Pennsylvania; I know about shutting down towns. Pridepeople lost their pride.
Folks, this is what trickle-down economics looks like. But now we're turning things around. Since I took office, we've attracted over half a trillion dollars in private investment in manufacturing in Americaindustries of the future. We're seeing a factory boom. Spending on construction of manufacturing plants nearly doubled in the last 2 years, after growing only 2 percent under my predecessor in his 4-year term.
The last quarter factory construction contributed tomore to the gross domestic product than it did any time in the last 40 years. Instead of exporting American jobs, we're creating American jobs and exporting American products again. That's how we make money.
Like here at Auburn Manufacturing, now, you heard Kathie talk about starting this company 40 years ago making advanced textiles that are fire and heat resistant. They weathered decades of economic storms. Now, with the help of the American Rescue Plan, they're having their biggest export year ever. The company is growing, and their products are made in America. Made in America.
Not just here, but here we're seeing a resurgence in Maine's paper industry as well. Under the previous administration, a mill in Westbrook owned by Sappi North America laid off 75 workers. Under my administration, they got a million-dollar grant from the American Rescue Plan. They used it to invest in technology to improve pulp yields. Now they're expanding their business, creating hundreds of good-paying jobs.
In Bucksport, the old Verso site is now home of an aquafarming company that raises sustainable salmon. The town is beginning to boom again.
And that's just the beginning. We're focused on growing the rural economy in Maine as well and all across the country. For example, under my administration, Maine has received millions of dollars to strengthen and expand access to small and mid-sized meat and poultry processing. Up to now, you had to go hundreds of miles, and you only had a few processors, and they gave you what they thought was necessary, not what your product was worth.
Having these facilities close by means farmers have a better shot at getting a fair price for their product. When those farmers do well, when the wealth they generate stays in Maine, when their children can stay in Maine and continue to farm, it builds a strong rural economy.
Building an economy from the bottom up and the middle out means small and mid-sized farmers, foresters, fishermen have a chance to succeed right here where they're from and don't want to leave.
That's why we're providing funding to encourage companies to use resources harvested in Maine for new and innovative products. And we're creating new markets for those products, like mass timber for the use in tall buildings or plant-based packaging materials or sustainable aviation fuels. That's where it's going to come from, by the way. Mark my words, the next 20 years, farmers are going to be providing 95 percent of all the sustainable airline fuel. From product.
We're helping fund renovations at the library of Bar Harbor or Portland Museum of Art using locally sourced mass timber.
We have a grant to a company called Tanbark in Saco to replace plastic packaging with packaging using wood fiber. And so your kids turn onhow many of your kids come to you and say, ""Mommy, I didn't realize all that plastic was killing all those things in the ocean."" Those ads you see. But because of what's going to happen here, that's not going to happen.
Bio-based products are the future of Maine, and Maine is leading the way.
Just last week, the National Climate Adviser was in Madison for the opening of TimberHP, a brandnew company that's turned a shuttered paper mill into America's first wood fiber insulation factory produced with 100-percent clean energy, helping families save on energy bills and creating 140 new jobs.
And I want to congratulate Governor Mills, who just yesterday signed legislation making Maine a leader in offshore wind industry. It's a big deal. It is a big, big deal. Committingand the Federal Government is doing the samecommitting to 3 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2040 and which will create good-paying union jobs.
I remember the Business Roundtablethe big businessmen, they said, ""Why are you known as the most prolabor Senator in the history of America?"" A simple reason: It makes sure the product is better and ultimately cheaper.
You know, everybody thinks that to become afor example, an electrician. You show up and say, ""I want to be an electrician."" You've got 5 years5 years you've got to work before you can get a full salary and have the right to able to go out there as an electrician. It's like going back to college. Five years. They're the best in the world.
This kind of resurgence is part of my plan to invest in America so our future, again, is made in America.
Most people don't know there has been a law on the books since 1933, which means it's totally consistent with all trade laws that exist in the world. And that law says that when the Federal Government spends your tax dollars, it must be spent on American workers and products made in America.
So, for example, when the Congress comes along and says, we want to build new decks for aircraft carriersfor example, over the last so many years, I get $60 billion they vote to do things federally. Well, guess what? They ain't doing any of it unless they build it in America, by American workers. Because for the last 50 years, the vast majority of Democrats and Republicans did not insist on thatdid notand that's what I mean by ""Made in America.""
Well, guess what? I'm insisting on it. That's why it's here. And by the way, it's good for everybody. It's not just good for labor, it's good for everybody.
And today I'm going to sign an Executive order called ""Invent It Here, and Make It Here."" It'shere's how it works: Federal agencies research and fund development to encourage innovation. This Executive order dictates that those agencies have to prioritize domestic manufacturing when it comes time to bring those inventions to market. They can't go abroad. They have to look herewho can do it here. That's the law, and we're just beginning to enforce it.
Folks, we're not just making things in America. We're also buying American.
I announced new standards to require construction materials used in Federal infrastructure projects to be made in America: lumber, glass, drywall, fiber optic cables, and more. Every Federal infrastructure project will be built by American workers using American products, creating American jobs.
Folks, you know, these international agencies rate all governments about their capacities. We used to be ratedhave the number-one best infrastructure in the world. Now we're number 13. China used to be beyond 13, and now they're number 2 or 3. What's going on here?
How can you have the mostthe best economy in the world and the 13th-ranked infrastructure in the world?
Through the bipartisan infrastructure lawsome of my Republicans crossed over and supported thiswe've already announced over 37,000 projects in 4,500 communities. Remember we used to have ""Infrastructure Week"" in the last guy's administration? Now we've got Infrastructure Decade. Because guess what? Guess what? It's 1 trillion 300 billion dollars invested in America over the next 10 years, $1.5 billion invested right here in Maine so far.
For example, we're cleaning up legacy pollution: Callahan Mine in the Superfund site in Brooksville. Maine is receiving $164 million to replace lead service lines and improve drinking water and address contaminants like PFAS. We're removing every single lead pipe in America. They're a risk to everyone's health, especially to our children, with400,000 school fountains have that lead in them.
Right now over 42,000 homes and small businesses across Maine don't have access to high-speed internet. We're investing $500 million in Maine to connect every single corner of the State, especially in rural communities, to the internetaffordable internet. And we're making it affordable, saving nearly 100,000 families $30 a month for their internet bills.
We're making investments like this all across the country. You can see exactly where to go, if you go toonline to go to invest.cominvest.com. Punch in wherever neighborhood you want to find out about, and you'll see what we're doing.
These investments are going to create thousands of jobs across the country. We're making sure workers have the skills they need to do these jobs
In Maine, the AFL-CIO iswith funding from the American Rescue Planjust graduated its first cohort of its Union Construction Academy to bring unprecedented workers, like women and people of color, into the trades.
The IBEW[applause.] The IBEW, also with funding from the American Rescue Plan, runs a pre-apprenticeship program for high school students, and there is a training center in Newport.
Folks, this matters.
My ""Investing in America"" agenda also has another transformative impact. Every single Republican in the Congress voted against the Inflation Reduction Act. That's the one that had a total of $659 billion in it for infrastructureI mean for the environment over the next several years.
You see, they don't think we have an environmental crisis. All this stuff happening is just temporary. They don't wonder about it anymore. You know, when the ocean off the State of Delawareor off of Florida is 102 degrees, something is going on.
The vast majority of them voted against the infrastructure law as well. But that hasn't stopped them from claiming credit for it now that billions of dollars and thousands of jobs are coming into their States. Well, like I said at the State of the Union: I'll see them at the ground breaking. [Laughter]
Folks, the distinguished Senator from Alabama put out a release saying Alabama is soI forget the exact numberis going to get 1 billion 600 million dollars for such and such. He voted against it. He voted against it. I could go on, but I won't. [Laughter]
But I made a commitment when I ran that I'd be President for everybody, whether they voted for me or against me. The vasta majority of all this money is going into red States because they've been so badly hurt. A majority of it. I'm not picking winners and losers based on who they voted for. I'm picking winners and losers based on the need they have in their communities.
Folks, let me close with this. I'm not here to declare victory on the economy. We have more work to do. We have a plan for turning things around.
Bidenomics is just another way of saying restoring the American Dream. Forty years of trickle-down economics limited that dream to the very top.
But I believe every American willing to work should be able to get a job, no matter where they livein the Heartland, small towns, the Northeast, big citiesto raise their kids on a good paycheck and keep their roots where they grew up.
My dad used to have a saying. My dad was a well-read man whose greatest regret was he never got to go to college, but a really decent, honorable man. And he used toand I give you my word, this is what he'd sayand all my siblings remember and my friends. He'd say: ""Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay. It's going to be okay.'""
That's what it's all about. That's what it's about. That's the American Dream. If you're willing to work hard, you ought to be able to make it. It shouldn't be limited to just a few people. It's rooted in what's always worked best in this country: investing in America, investing in Americans. Because when we invest in our people and we strengthen the middle class, we see stronger economic growth, and everybody benefits.
You know, we're making significant progress, and I want you to know we've done all this without raising taxes. And guess what? I commit that we'll never raise Federal tax on anybody making less than $400,000. Period.
Unlikeand you hear some of my friends on the other side, the MAGA Republicans, saying Big Spendin' Biden is raising the deficit. Guess what? In the 4 years that the last guy was President, he raised the national debt by almost 40 percent. You know that $2 trillion tax cut? Raise your hand if you got any of it. Two trillion, not a penny paid for.
But guess what? In 2 years, I've cut the national debt by 1 trillion 700 billion dollars while doing all of thiswhile doing all this[applause]1 trillion 700 billion dollars.
Because when ordinary people are able to make a living, they buy things, they go out and do things, they're able to live. And it raises funding. It doesn't cut it. It doesn't cutthe idea that we're going to have a bigger debt.
For the longest time, I've been told to give up on American manufacturing. And some of you have been involved in American manufacturinghow many times have you been told, ""Well, we used to be the largest manufacturer in the world, but not anymore. We can't compete."" Hell we can't compete.
There is nobody in the world we can't beat, let alone compete. I've never believed it. And we have the tools to change it. America used to lead the world in manufacturing, and we're doing it again.
Folks, I'm honestlyI can honestly say I've never been more optimistic about America's future. Now, I know I look like I've only been around a couple of days, but[laughter]I've been around a long time.
I've saidand I've said toand all my colleagues, and I think my former colleague in the Senate used to hear me say it: It's never, ever been a good bet to bet against the American people. Never, never, never. And it's a real bad bet to bet against us now.
So, folks, I really mean this: We just have to remember who in God's name we are. We are the United States of America. And there has never been a single thinga single thingwe've set our mind to in war or peace, when we've done it together, we haven't accomplished. Not one thing.
That's who we are. Let's not forget that. There is nothing beyond our capacity if we work together like you're doing here in Maine.
So God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you very much.
[The President left the podium and greeted members of the audience. He then returned to the signing desk and continued his remarks as follows.]
And the bad news is, I'm coming back to shake your hand, but I forgot I didn't sign the order. [Laughter] All that talk and no action.
All right. I'm signing the Executive order. Federal research and development in support of domestic manufacturing in the United States, which means more jobs.
[The President signed the Executive order titled ""Federal Research and Development in Support of Domestic Manufacturing and United States Jobs.""]

2023-07-28 00:00:00,"Remarks at a Campaign Reception in Freeport, Maine","
The President. Thank you very much. Let me begin with three comments. One, this is a busman's holiday for my colleagues I serve with. Thank you for being here. The worst thing to have to do is come in here anotherpick your same party you agree withyour own party and hear somebody. Thank you very much. It's above and beyond the call.
And secondly, to all the kids here, I want to make clear: If nothing happensafter this is over, if you all come up, I'm going to give you some money to make your mom and dad to take you to Dairy Queen. [Laughter] Okay? All right? Okay. You all think I'm kidding; I'm not. Can you imagine when you were 10 years old""We're going to go spend the afternoonwe're going to get dressed tocome on, honey."" Anyway, thank you, thank you, thank you. Only thing that could be worse: You couldyour mom or dad could be a President, then you would have to show up at all this stuff. [Laughter]
And the third thing I'd like to say is thatyou know, one of the reasons I'm stillit mayit may hurt his reputation, but all kidding aside, one of the reasons why I am still in politics was because of a Maine guy named Ed Muskie. Not a joke.
Ed Muskie and Teddy Kennedy and the guy from South Carolina who was the United States Senatorbecause I had just been elected to the Senate. I was 29 years old. I wasn't old enough to be sworn in. I had to wait until I could be sworn in. But I had to start to hire staff.
So I was down in Washington using Teddy Kennedy's Whip office so I could interview people. And I got a phone call saying my wife and daughter had just been killed. And so I decidedmy brother, who's 5 years younger, was my finance chair. And by the way, I was listed, for 36 years, the poorest man in Congress. So he needed a lot of help. [Laughter]
But. all kidding aside, we wereI wanted him to talk to the Democratic Governor who had just been elected so he would appoint someonebecause I'm the first moderate-to-liberal member from the Democratic Party.
Our State iswas a border State. We were segregated by law. We were a slave State. And all the vestiges left over are still there. And so I was the first ""progressive""quote, unquotetoday we would say. But back in those days, I was considered, compared to the Democratic Partythe Democratic Governor had an opportunity, Gov, to decide whether he or she wanted to be member of the Northeast Democratic CoalitionGovernors' Conference or the Southern Governors'. And most Governors picked to be part of the Southern Governors' Conference.
And so two-thirds of the State, as Angus knows, in the Delmarva Peninsula talk at 'cha like this, a lot of good ol' boys. [Laughter] No, I'm serious.
And so I asked my brother if he would talk to the Governor and pick someone in my place. And my sister is my best friend and managed all my campaigns. She's 3 years younger. We are 2 years apart in school. She graduated; I graduated from the same university, 2 years apart. She graduated Phi Beta Kappa; I graduated. [Laughter] Sheno, I'm not joking. She managed all themy campaigns.
My point is this: That these men probably saved my sanity by convincing me to stay. What the argument was: Just come and stayjust come and stay for 6 months. Help us organize. We had 58 Democratic Senators. They didn't need anybody to organize. We had whoeverit could be a Democratic Senator[inaudible]at my place.
But Ed Muskie went out of his way for meall the little things. One of the most important men in the Congress, who should have been Presidentone of the most important men in the Congress. He would just spend time with me.
He would come by my office, and Ifor example, I wouldn't go toI didn't go over and meet and eat with the Senators in the dining room. I would just stayI didn't want toI just wanted to getjust not get engaged. And he just went out of his way.
And I look back on it. And you probably help people like that, like I was, many times yourselves, but it mattered. It mattered. My two boys survived. My familyI had great help with my family, my extended family.
But Ed Muskie was a man of enormous, enormous, enormous character. And he had a guy named Hathaway with him that I came alongwe came along together and became close friends.
I've always thought of Maine asit's going to sound bizarre to say this, but as a virtuous place. I'm not joking. It was a place that everybody seemed to have sort of just basicthey disagreed. Like a young womanI was justdid an eventa speaking event in Maine. And I was talking about the economy. And afterwards, I'm going out, shaking hands with people. And a lovely young womanlooked to beshe was in her early thirtieswas a State rep. She had her pin on. And I said, ""Well, you guys passed the legislation for""yes, for
Audience member. Family leave.
The President. Family leave, thank you. For family leave. And she said, ""Oh, I voted against it."" [Laughter] And she said, ""I'm a Republican, but I like you."" [Laughter]
But my point is this: We used to talk to one another. We used to get along with one another. There used to be a civilitywhat weand in the lastthe last 10 years, things have begun to change.
You may remember, I made a speechbecause it got a lot of publicity, not all positive. I made a speech at Independence Hall before the 2022 elections6 days outwhere I said our democracy is at stake. Literally, not figuratively. And they thought it was an exaggeration. But guess what? Sixty-six percent of the American people thought that the case: Democracy is at stake.
And so mythe reason I'm so happy to be here with your representatives: They're all decent, honorable people. We can argue like hell. We disagree, although I don't want to get them in trouble. We don't disagree very often. [Laughter] But, anywayso I think of Maine like I used to think of my State, where everybody knows everybody. And you know, there's an old joke: You know, be careful what you say, they may be related. [Laughter]
So, at any rate, I want to thank you for allowing me to come back to Maine, which I've been here many times, but not since I've been President. Number one.
Number two, I think we're at a place where we're at a genuine inflection point in history. I had a physics professor who said that an inflection point is the time you're going down the highway 60 miles an hour and you make an abrupt, 45-degree or 30-degree turn to the right. You can never get back on the path you were on before. It occurs every five, six, seven generations in world history.
But the world is changingchanging not because Joe Biden is President or Putin is leading Russia. It's because everything's changing from global warming. I last was with Putin two Christmases ago, and I pointed out: He has eight time zones, and the entire tundra is melting. Methane is leaking. It's never going to freeze again.
We've got a fundamental change we've got to deal with. We're seeing changes not just to the climate, but across the world in fundamental ways. And so we'd better get going on what we're going to do about it, both in foreign policy and domestic policy.
But before I decided to announce for the Senate, and I wasn't going to runI mean for the Presidency, the last time out. And, I think Angus knows: I wasn't going to run again. I had just lost my son. He died because of beingsleeping next to a burn pit for a year andin Baghdad. And he was a decorated soldier. HeConspicuous Service medal, the Bronze Star, attorney general of the State of Delaware. Presumptuous of me to say this: He should be the one talking to you today, not me. He was quitehe was attorney general of the State.
My point is that, you know, there's a lot going on. Name me a part of the world that you think is going to look like it did 10 years ago 10 years from nownot a joke. But it presents enormous opportunitiesenormous opportunities. I'm just going to go through a few for you, if you will be willing to stick with me on this.
First of all, you know, on the economic front, we have made some real progress in the first 2 years. We'veover 13.2 million new jobs, beyond when we went into the pandemic. We'veinflation is down from 9 percent to 3 percent. We're in a situation where we have a circumstance that we've created 810,000 manufacturing jobs. And how many of you were told manufacturing is dead? You watched it happen here in Maine in the small towns, like in Delaware, in the Midwest, and NevadaI mean, Nebraska, allall red, blue States.
A factory that mom and dad worked at for 30 years and made a decent salaryall of a sudden, one day, it up and goes abroad. Because why? We started a process that we hadwe took thethe whole notion of trickle-down economics to an extreme. We shipped ourwe found the cheapest labor in the world we could find and we shipped the factories over there. And then we brought the product back here, and we sold it here. And America found itself in trouble.
Well, I decided that the way to changeto deal with a changed world here was not that we couldn't compete anymore, it's because we had the wrong philosophy about how to compete. I insisted thatand Iand I've been doing thisI know I don't look it, but I've been doing this a long time. [Laughter]
And one of the things that weI decided we should buildand I've thoughthad this view for a long time: That we should build the economy from the middle out and the bottom up. When that occurs, everybody does well. The wealthy do very well.
I'm a capitalist. I come from the corporate State of the world. More businessesand some of you know because you may be incorporatedthey're incorporated in Delawarethan every other State in the Union combined. Every State. And I represented, as Senator, for 36 years, so I'm not antibusiness. But everybody has got to pay their fair share. Everybody has got to pay their fair share.
We went from having 746 billionaires in America before the pandemic to a thousand. And guess what their average Federal tax is: 8.3 percent. How can that be right? How can that be fair? And so I started to focus on: What do we do to bring this back?
We used to behave the number-one infrastructure in the world. We're ranked number 14. The United States of America, bythe international folks say that wewe're the 14th best infrastructure: roads, bridges, and the like.
China used to be, I think, 17 or 16. Now number two. What's the matter? Something is wrong. How can we lead the world being 14th in the world on our infrastructure? I'm not joking. Think about it in practical terms, just pure practical terms.
Secondly, manufacturing. You saw what's happened here in Maine. The same thing has happened in Nebraska. You don't have to be in the Northeast. It's the same thing all across the country. How many times have you heard people say they've had their son or daughter has graduated from high school here and then went to college and came back to say: ""Mom, I can't stay. There's no jobs for me here. There's nothing here for me.""
You lost employment like a lot of places lost it. And it's not just manufacturing. How do we getand by the way, we invented the computer chip. Weit's tinier than the little, tiny end of my finger here. And guess what? We used to have 40 percent of the market. We've got 5 percent.
And you all saw what happened when we got in real trouble in inflation, when you couldn't build automobiles and shutting down plants. It takes so many computer chips to be able to do it.
So I got my colleagues and leadership of this man sitting in the front here of thedealing with thethe legislation that had to do with providing for investment in technology. And it was called the CHIPS Act. And guess what? It's attracted off the sidelines almost a trillion dollars in private equity investmentalmost a trillion.
No, I'mthis is not rocket science. For example, we used to not be able to produce the chips. Well, guess what? We have over $300 billion of commitments to build new chip factories in the United States of America.
And guess what that does? Not only is all thethe construction work and providing union labor to people to get a decent wage, changing their abilitymy dad used to say, ""Joey, at the end of the""no, I'm not jokingmy dad was a very refined guy who was very well-read, never had a chance for a college education.
And wehe'd come home and close the business he was runninghe didn't own it; he was a managerhe'd come home for dinner and then go back and close it. My dad used to say, ""Joey, the measure is whether at the end of the month you're able to pay all your bills and you have a little breathing roomjust a little breathing room."" So many Americans have no breathing room. No breathing room.
And so what do we do? When I went to South Korea and convinced the chip factory to invest in America, and they're investing $100 billion. I said, ""Why are you doing it?"" They said, ""Simple: You're the safest place in the world to invest, number one. And number two, you have the best workers in the world."" Not a joke. I'm not making this up. This is real.
Look what's happening: everything from Poughkeepsie, New York, to just outside of Columbus, Ohio, where Intel has just investing $20 billion building twowhat they call ""fabs""factories. You know what happens when those fabsthey employ thousands of people. And guess what? The average salary is going to be $131,000, and you don't need a college degree to do it.
I was making the case to the Business Roundtable, you know, the biggest corporations in America. They're good people, decent people. And they were asking me why was investing so much money in organized labor and convincingandin labor? I said, ""Because you need them."" And they said, ""Well, what we need""and I said: ""We did a survey when I was Vice President. And wewe met with 342 of the Fortune 500 companies, either on Zoom or in person. I said, 'What do you need most?' They said, 'We need a better educated public.' I said, ""What the heck are you doing about it? Why you oppose my dealing with investing more money in preschool?""
Noton third grade3 years old, going to schoolnot daycare, school. All the studies showthe Harvard, Stanford studies shows it increased by 57 percent, no matter what the background the child comes from, their ability to get through 12 years of school or not. What's the problem?
And by the way, they're beginning to help. It's self-interest.
But my generic point is simple: That there's so much available to us as a countryso much available to us. We've just got to remember who in the Lord's name we are.
We're in a situation where if you take a look at what we've done around the worldyou know, you take a look atdoes anybody think that the postwar eras still exist, the rules of the road from the end of World War II?
I'm being deadly earnest. It's not hyperbole, just direct statement. It doesn't.
I spent my whole lifethe reason I turned down being able to run for Governor, which is a very important job, when I was young man is I wanted to be involved in a foreign policy. I spent most of my life as the chairman of Foreign Relations Committee or doing foreign policy for Barack or now. It's kind of fascinating to take a look at what's going on.
We look atdoes anybody think that Europe was likely to hold together if we hadn't pulled it together? Not a joke, not a joke.
I spent over 180 hours with heads of state from the G-7 and the European Union, just holding it together. NATO is stronger today than it's ever been in its existencenot just because of me, but it's stronger today.
And look what's happening with regard to China in the Indian Ocean and in theyou know, I got asked by Xi why I call myself a Pacific nation. I said: ""Because we are. We have a longer border on the Pacific than you do. We are a Pacific nation."" And I said, ""And you wouldn't have been able to move at all unless we were providing you the stability you needed."" Give you my word, he looked at me and said: ""You're right. You're right.""
Look what's happening. Does anybody ever think Japan would increase its military budget over its domestic budget and help a European war on the side of the West? That's what it's doing. It's changing the dynamic significantly.
I'm hosting little[inaudible]at Camp David next week. I'm bringing along the leaders of Japan and South Korea. They made a rapprochement from World War II: fundamental change.
Look what's happening inin Southeast Asia, where now I put together the Quadmeaning India, Japan, Australia, and the United States. Xi said: ""Why are you doing that? You're trying to surround me."" I said: ""No, that's not the reason. I just want to make sure the rules of the road aren't changing.""
International airspace is international airspace. International water space is water space. You can't tell us we can't. Well, where we're going to put up an air identification zone, meaning you can't fly through certain areas, even though it's international airspace. And guess what we did? We flew a B-1 bomber through. Not a joke. Not a joke. Because we can't let this change that's taking place.
I've gotten a call from the head of Vietnam, desperately wants to meet me when I go to the G-20. He wants to elevate us to a major partner, along with Russia and China. What do you think that's about? No, I'm not joking.
I'm not going to take you around the world, but the point is, the world is changing. The world is changing in a big way. And we want to promote democraciesdemocracies.
Watch what's happened in the Middle East. I got criticized from going to Saudi Arabia, remember? Well, guess what? I got them to prevent overflights for Israel. So theythere's a rapprochement may be underway.
My generic point is, there is so much going on that we can make the world for this young man who's going to be President someday, we can make it a lot safer and better and more secure. We know who's on first, who's on second, and so on.
So, if you think about what's happeningand I was going to make a more detailed speech, but it'sI'm keeping you too long alreadytheif you think about what's happening, there is a confluence, if we get this right, of both domestic economic policy and foreign policy. I can make a safer and more secure than we've been a long, long time.
And that's what I'm about. That's what I want to do. I want to get to the point where we're in a situation where we knowlook, I said earlier today that I've never been more optimistic about America's future than I am today. I mean it. That's not hyperbole. I've been saying it for a year.
The reason is: Think of anything America's ever set its mind to that we haven't been able to do. Name methey asked me, ""If you could do one thing, what would you do?"" I said, ""I'd cure cancer."" They said, ""Why?"" It's because it's the one thing people think we can't do.
To demonstrate: This is the United States of America, damn it. When we've worked together, there is no major problem we've been unable to solve. None. And today, we are splintered in a way we never have been.
I'll conclude by telling you a little story. You know, I didn'teven though I sat for 8 years in the Vice President's chair, every morning at 9 o'clock with Barack starting the day off for 8 years, I didn't realize that there was a circumstance where on Inauguration Day, the outgoing President has to be out of the office by 10 o'clock. The incoming President can't come in until 3 o'clock.
So I asked mybecause they set aside the furniture, what desk, what rugs, whatwhatever you wantand so I asked my brother Jimmy to take care of it for me. And he called the Presidential historian named Jon Meacham, a well-known guy, in to help him because there are certain things that matter: What bust did I want there?
Sit at my desk, and there is only two political leaders I ever had: One was Dr. King and the other was Bobby Kennedy. I had great respect for John Kennedy, but I could never picture him at my kitchen table. I can theoretically think of Bobby Kennedy there. And Csar Chvezwhose granddaughter is running in my campaign, by the waywho almost cost me an election in 1972.
By the way, because I was sympathetic to the farmworkers, and Southern Delaware, where you've got a $4 billion industry on chickens, they ain't happy about that. [Laughter]
And so, all kidding aside, thatand then, you know, there is a woman who wouldn't move to the back of the bus and changed the whole world. And Harry Truman. I also have Ben Franklin, because I was a Ben Franklin professor of lawinternational law at Penn for 4 years, and it was a requirement.
But here's the deal: I think I walked into that office and, for yearsand I was in there a lot because ofI was chairman of Judiciary or Vice President for a longI meanor excuse meor the chairman of Foreign Relations for a long time. And I walked in, and the only portrait above the fireplace was one of George Washington. Only one all the time I've been there, and I've been there 600 years. [Laughter]
And I walk inthey had the rug that I wanted. We changed the rug and the desk, the Resolute Desk, and my brother picked out the furniture, the couches, and the like. And obviously, Trump wasn't there. He's the first President in the history of the United States of America that didn't show up on Inauguration Day. Classy guy. [Laughter] I was just as happy he didn't.
But my point was that I looked up and I saw thisthere is this big portrait four timesthree times as big as the Washington portraitof Franklin Roosevelt. And I said, ""I'm an admirer, but why Franklin Roosevelt?""
And Meacham spoke up, and he said, ""Because no President has taken on the job of President with a world at greater financial disarray than he was."" I said: ""Oh, that's good. I'm really happy about that."" [Laughter] I'm serious.
And I said, ""Why""and then there were four smaller portraits. One of Washingtonthe original one was up on the right-hand corner. I mean, if you're looking from my desk, on the left-hand corner. And below it was Abraham Lincoln. I said, ""Why Lincoln?"" He said, ""The Nation has never been as divided since the Civil War.""
Well, folks, you know, I'm not sure how far off they are. But I am sureI am surewe cannot succeed as a country unless we change it. No, no think about it.
Iyou may remember when I ran the first time, I said I'm running for three reasons. I think my campaign disagreed with my saying it, but I meant it.
One, I wanted to restore the soul of America. We start to treat each other with decency and honor and deal with people in a way that that is more like who we are. Not a joke.
The second thing was I said I want to build the economy from the middle out and the bottom up.
And I said the third thing is, you've got to unite America. Well, your great Senator, George Mitchell, is a close friend of mine I just spoke to. He was the guy, when I left, said Biden did more to be able to bring Republicans and Democrats together than anybody when he was here. An exaggeration on his part, but it was very nice of him to say.
But guess what? Who do you deal with now? How do you get certain things done? Ask Angus what it's like getting things done in the Senate or the House.
But we have to do that. How can you be a participatory democracy without there being the ability to bring people together? How does that happen?
And the last generic point I'll make to you is that, you know, having spent most of my time as Vice President doing foreign policy for Barack and having spent my career focusing mostly on foreign policy for the 36 years I was a Senator, I thought II thought I knew the consequence of an American President. But it's amazing.
Madeleine Albright wrote a book. And she referred to America as ""the essential nation."" We literally are. Ask yourself a rhetorical question: Who could possibly bring the world together? Not a joke. Not me. But the President of the United States of America. Who could do it unless the President of the United States does it? Who? What nation could do it?
And so, folks, there's a lot at stakea whole lot at stake. And I think we have an opportunity. And one of the ways we make life better for us is make life better for the rest of the world. That's why I pushed so hard for the Build Back Better initiative to build the infrastructure in Africa and in Latin America and South America.
We're the ones who polluted the world. We clear cut everything. We made a lot of money. Lula from Brazil wants to meet with me shortly because, you know, there's more carbon absorbed from the air in the Amazon than all the carbon emitted in thefrom the United States of America on a yearly basis.
But guess what? Theythey're having trouble. They want their farmers to be able to go out and clear the land and make money and so on.
So there's a lot that's out there that we have a chance to do. And, again, there's nothing you can name for me that if America set its mind to do it, we have not been able to do it over time. Nothing. Nothing.
And the whole world is changing. But if we grab hold, we apply the ingenuity and ouryou know, our greatest strengthI said when I got elected I was going to have an administration that looked like America. Well, guess what it is? I have a higher percentage of women on my Cabinet than any President ever hadmore than the number of men.
In the military, for the first time ever, we're having the Chief of Naval Operations is a woman. Two other four-stars[inaudible]. So it's changing.
I've appointed more appellate court judges to the Federal courts thanwho are African American than every other President in America combined.
And by the way, not for political reasons. For a simple reason: Our strength is our diversity. Our strength is our diversity. It's about time we begin to use it and understand it, deal with it.
So, folks, look, imagineand by the way, all the stuff we did in the economy, all these programs that we've put forwardin the process, I cut the Federal debt by $1.7 trillion in 2 years. More than any other President of the United States has come close. The last President increased it by $4 trillion.
Folks, there's nothing we can't do if we remember who in God's name arethis is the United States of America. There's nothing beyond our capacity.
And if you think allyou think I was exaggerating about we're at an inflection point? Just take a look at AI. Artificial intelligence. Hang on, baby. It has enormous promise, but enormous possibilities to go wrong. We've got to know what we're doing.
And so, folks, look, theyou know, imagine what we can do if we finish the job. Like I said, I don't thinkI think that ordinary people should have an opportunity to get a good education, ordinary people should be able to afford to go to college. I love it when I get criticized for forgiving debt for people whose income is not above $60,000 for college.
Well, guess what? We had the PPP program. If you ran a diner, you had five employees, and, during the pandemic, you got in trouble, guess what? You getby the way, the woman who criticized me most? She got $220,000 back from that program. I'm not opposed the program, but give me a break. Give me a break.
So, look, you know, I believe this country is about to take off. And you're saying, ""When the hell is he going take off?"" [Laughter] But the investments we've made in the past 2 years have powered the transformation of this country in the next 50 years and, you know, doing something right now no one thought possible.
But most of them opposed everything that we did, everything we supported. But if you notice, all of a sudden, it's allthey'rethere's an inside joke. I say I'm showing up at the spade turning.
Guess what? You have the gentlewomantalk about an oxymoronfrom North Georgia, who is about to get one of the biggest environmental investments of billions of dollars in her district. And she's against it. Guess what? But she's talking about the clarion call.
You're going to get billions of dollars for making sure that everyone in this State has a connection to the internet and affordable.
Welland the Senator from Alabama, he knew how to coach Alabama, I think. Well, he sure as hell doesn't know what he's talking about now.
He just did a big press conference. ""Alabama is receiving $1.3 trillion to make sure we havewe have all of Alabamaall of Alabama wired for the internet. It's going to be cheaper."" He voted against it, campaigned against it. I'm going down when he makes his announcement. We're going to be with him.
Now, look, I just think that theyou know, it's been a long time. But as I said, I think thatI don't think there's a thing we can't do if we set our mind to it. We can't kid each other though. This democracy is at stake. Not a joke. Not a joke.
One of the reasons why I did the Emmett Till thing was I wanted to make it clear that history is history. And that his mother, making sure there was an open coffin so people knew exactly what happenedknew exactly what happenedtook an enormous amount of courage. And it was the Black press that exposed it and made people look at it.
Did you ever think you'd be in a country right now at your age and your circumstance where we're banning books? I just readmy wife wrote a book, not about politics at allthey took it out of libraries in Georgia. As we say in my religion, ""Bless me, Father, for I have sinned."" I mean, come on. I don't think that's who America is. I don't think that's the majority of Americans.
And with your help, we're going to make sure that it doesn't happen. That it does notwe don't get in a situation where we have a man whoif you just take what he said, on the record, I'm inclinedjust a snippetthe stuff he said with him and run those ads, some would say it's just flat seditious. Not who we are.
And you're all successful people. You traveled abroad. Ask any of your compatriotswhether they're left, right, or centerwhat they think aboutnot me, but about if the other guy comes back.
We've got a lot to do, but we've got a lot of hope. A lot of hope.
Asevery time I'd walk out of my Grandpop Finnegan's house up in Scranton, he was ahe went to Santa Clara and he was a newspaper guy and an All-American football player, by the way, in the days when they used to throw people over the line. [Laughter]
But he'd yell, ""Joey, keep the faith."" And my grandmother would yell, ""No, Joey, spread it."" Let's go spread the faith.

Joseph R. Biden, Remarks at a Campaign Reception in Freeport, Maine Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/363561 "
2023-07-27 00:00:00,Remarks on Efforts To Protect Communities From Extreme Heat,"
The President. Good afternoon.
We're here today with the mayors of Phoenix and San Antonio and senior members of my administration to talk about the existential threat of climate change. And it is a threat. We're going to outline steps we're taking to help communities who, right this minute, as both the mayors can tell you, are facing a real crisis in their cities.
We'll talk about steps we're taking to help people get through this tough time, and we're also going to talk about steps we're taking to help communities prepare, plan, and recover, and make our Nation more resilient in future heat waves. And there will be more.
I don't think anybody can deny the impact of the climate change anymore. There used to be a time when I first got here, a lot of people said, ""Oh, it's not a problem."" Well, I don't know anybodywell, I shouldn't say thatI don't know anybody who honestly believes climate change is not a serious problem.
Just take a look at the historic floods in Vermont and California earlier this year. Droughts and hurricanes that are growing more frequent and intense. Wildfires spreading a smoky haze for thousands of miles, worsening air quality. And record temperaturesand I mean recordare now affecting more than 100 million Americans.
Puerto Rico reached a 125-degree heat index last month. San Antonio hit an alltime heat index high of 117 last month. Phoenix has been over 110 degrees for 27 straight days.
And with El Nio and the short-term warming of the ocean that exacerbates the effects of climate change, making forecasts even hotter in the coming months.
Ocean temperatures near Miami are like stepping in a hot tub. They just topped 100 degrees100 degreesand they're hitting record highs around the world. And that's more like, as I said, jumping in a hot tub than jumping in an ocean to ride a wave.
Most people don't realize: For years, heat has been thenow, I have to admit I didn't know it either. I thought itI knew it was tough, but the number-one weather-related killer is heat. The number-one weather-related killer is heat. Six hundred people die annually from its effects, more than from floods, hurricanes, and tornadoes in America combined. And even those places that are used to extreme heat have never seen it as hot as it is now for as long as it's been.
Even those who deny that we're in the midst of a climate crisis can't deny the impact that extreme heat is having on Americans. Americans like an elderly woman in Phoenix who fell out of her wheelchair and, after 5 minutes on the ground, had third-degree burns. Third-degree burns.
Or the firefighter who'salready has to lug over 45 pounds of gear through smoke and flame, which is incredibly hot. The job is even harder and more dangerous to do in record heat.
For the farmworkers who have to harvest crops in the dead of night to avoid the high temperatures. Or farmers who risk losing everything they've planted for the year.
Or the construction workers who literally risk their lives working all day in blazing heat and, in some places, don't even have the right to take a water break. That's outrageous. That is outrageousanybody who says thatdoes that.
Folks, we really want to pretend these things are normal?
Experts say extreme heat is already costing America $100 billion a year. And it hits our most vulnerable the hardest: seniors, people experiencing homelessness who have nowhere to turn, disadvantaged communities that are the least able to recover from climate disasters.
And it's threatening farms, fisheries, forests that so many families depend on to make a living.
But none of this is inevitable. From day one of my administration, we've taken unprecedented action to combat the climate crisis that's causing this. We're using a law I got passed the first day in officefirst month in officecalled the American Rescue Plan, to help States and cities promote energy efficiency, reduce flooding, and open cooling centers.
We're delivering over $20 billion from the bipartisan infrastructure law to upgrade the electric grid to withstand stronger storms and heat waves so we don't cause more fires.
Look, last year I signed the Inflation Reduction Act, the most significant climate investment ever anywhere in the world. Meanwhile, FEMA has been on the ground responding to those unprecedented weather emergencies in real time. And I've traveled an awful lot in that helicopter with you all across the country andto see the devastation that occurs, the kind of wildfires and otherand drought and the like.
We've launched a place you can go, heat.govgo online to heat.govto share lifesaving information that you may need to know about.
Last year, my Department of Labor created the first-ever national program to protect workers from heat stress. Since then, we've conducted 2,600 heat-related inspections at workplaces nationwide to protect the health and safety of the workers on the job so they are being taken care of.
Today I'm announcing additional steps to help States and cities deal with the consequences of extreme heat.
First, I've asked Acting Labor Secretary Julie Su to issue a Heat Hazard Alert. It clarifies that workers have a Federal heat-relatedhave Federal heat-related protections. We should be protecting workers from hazardous conditions, and we will. And those States where they do not, I'm going to be calling them out, where they refuse to protect these workers in this awful heat.
Second, the Acting Secretary of Labor will work with her team to intensify enforcement, increasing inspections in high-risk industries like construction and agriculture.
This work builds on the national standard that the Labor Department is already developing for workforce and workplace heat-safety rules.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Forest Service will award more than $1 billion in grants to help cities and towns plant trees that in the long term will help repel the heat and expand access to green spaces so families have a place to go to cool off and to bring down the temperature in cities.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development is providing billions to communities to make buildings more efficient and to make more heatmake them more heat-resistant, opening cooling centers infor residential areas and in the cities that the communities can go to to be safe.
The Department of the Interior is using infrastructure funding to expand water storage capacity in the Western States to deal with the impacts of future droughts that are made everyall this more extremethis heatthis extreme heat more consequential.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is launching a new partnership with universities and impact communities to improve the Nation's weather forecasts and its accuracy so Americans everywhere can be better prepared when theywhenand they can better predict what the heat is going to be in that community with the weather.
In all my ""Investing in America"" agenda, we provided a record $50 billion for climate resiliency to restore wetlands, manage wildfires, help Americans in every State withstand extreme heat.
But our MAGA extremists in Congress are trying to undo all this progress. Not a single one of themnot a single Republican votedvoted for the Inflation Reduction Act, which had all this money for climate, which provides funding to combat climate change. And now many of them are trying to repeal those provisions, but we're not going to let that happen.
Part of the reason we're here today is to get the word out so State and local governments know these resources are available and uses them. I want the American people to know help is here and we're going to make it available to anyone who needs it.
Follow guidance from the local leaders and public safety officials when you hear it in your cities and towns and States. Stay indoors if you're vulnerable. Be careful on hot pavement. Know the signs of heat stroke, like headache, nausea, dizziness. And always have water with you. That sounds silly, but always have a bottle of water with you when you're outside.
Check on loved ones and neighbors who may not have air conditioning, and check on them on a regular basis. Or go to the mall or community centers or movie theaters or libraries where there is air conditioning when you don't have that air conditioning at home.
Take advantage of local cooling centers. Hundreds are being built. They're there for everyone, and they save lives. It matters.
Now I'm going to turn it over to the mayor of Phoenix, who's on the frontlines of dealing with extreme heat.
And fire away, Mayor. We're anxious to hear what you have to say.
[At this point, Mayor Kate S. Gallego of Phoenix, AZ, spoke via videoconference as follows.]
Mayor Gallego Thank you so much, President Biden. Thank you for convening us today to talk about something near and dear to my heart and on so many of our minds: extreme heat.
We really appreciate your leadership on climate change with legislation such as the Inflation Reduction Act that will be the most important in a generation.
Phoenix is known for heat. We are often called the Valley of the Sun. We have relentless summer heat followed by beautiful months of weather. But right now this summer has really been unprecedented. And you've spoken about some of the challenges we have faced here in Phoenix. It's taking a real toll on our community.
We feel like we are very much on the frontlines of climate change.
The President. You are.
Mayor Gallego. I've tried to makeand it'sman, you can feel it outside today. We haveI've tried to make it my mission to adapt to this trend, to stay ever innovative, and ensure we aren't falling behind on heat resilience.
We're working to outinnovate climate change, but we need to work together to make sure all of us are on deck to address it. We need a whole-of-Government approach. Phoenix is the first in the Nation to have a permanent publicly funded heat office. They love the data that NOAA and your Federal Government is putting out to help us.
Our emergency personnel and heat-ready volunteers are working diligently to keep residents safe through targeted outreach on heat safety, park trail closures, and timely responses to help our most vulnerable.
The heat is a challenge for folks who don't have access to adequate AC or who are outdoors most of the day, so a large part of our efforts is getting residents inside as much as possible. We do it in a variety of ways through cooling centers located across the countrythe county, mobile cooling units, respite centers, and encouraging hydration at one of our many water stations.
We also recognize that many families need assistance to make their air conditioners more effective or need Federal aid with their energy bills. And Federal dollars have just been crucial in supporting families' abilities to make their homes safer and more comfortable.
The Department of Energy's Weatherization Assistance Program makes homes more energy efficient, lowering energy bills for the long haul, reducing overload on the grid, and making homes more comfortable in intense heat.
Paired with the incredible incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act for residential solar, this can make an enormous impact for families. And Mayor Nirenberg, who's joining us, has been a real leader and a model for mayors in how to communicate all the good things that are in the IRA to our residents.
The HHS Low-Income Household Energy Assistance Program, LIHEAP, has been crucial for low-income families to help with energy bills. Even when the heat is over, many of our families may see their largest ever energy bill in their mailboxes.
And we're among the many warm-weather communities asking for balanced consideration of how these formulas are structured. Expanding these solutions would have immediate impact for families.
We are also using ARPA dollars to address heat. And we are looking forward to applying for the funding for trees, which could really go a long way in making our communities more comfortable, that you have secured in the Inflation Reduction Act.
We deal with this heat on an annual basis. So we've been focused on preparedness from day one and really trying to prepare for what is, for us, a long-term emergency.
You mentioned how many lives are lost to heat, and that's a real focus for us. We would love it if Congress would give you the ability to declare heat a disaster. We think that could really save additional aid, and that would even more multiply the impact of FEMA Hazard Mitigation Assistance and Building ResistantResilience Infrastructurethe BRIC programs, which are a good start to building long-term solutions, such as energy redundancy for cooling centers.
So we feel like there are a lot of great tools. And I appreciate you helping communities across the country just make sure they're aware of the great ways the Federal Government is partnering. We're looking forward to working with you to become even more effective.
Thank you.
The President. Well, Kate, thank you very much.
Look, you've established the Office of Heat Response and Mitigation. And sometimesI think those of us in Government do this all the time: We think everybody knows what all these titles and all these acronyms mean. But can you give meshare some examples of the work and the outreach that you're doing in the community to try to let people know what's available and how you can help? I mean, what kinds of thingbecause I find that's the difficult thing to do sometimes.
Mayor Gallego. Absolutely. We're getting better every year, and we learn every year. We're trying to get out and share maps of where all the cooling centers are to deliver cooling kits.
You mentioned checking on loved ones. We have a formal program called ""Cool Callers"" at the city of Phoenix
The President. Good for you.
Mayor Gallego. where we canyou can register your family members or if you know you might need a check during the heat of the summer. And we would love for more people to sign up to be checked on.
It's athe volunteers have been amazing. We've had thousands of engagement. And just having that permanent office has given us a place for people to go both with ideas and when they want to volunteer. And we've been able to use some of your Federal programs, including trying to find new ways to build housing indoors so that our construction workers are safer.
So we appreciate the partnership. It's made our heat office more effective.
The President. Well, it's not going to alleviate it rightthe heat problem right now, but we also have a number of programs to do everything from allow people to have the ability to get help to literally paint their roofs white, to change thetheir windows and doors, to get tax credits for doing it so heat doesn'tso air conditioning doesn't escape, to be ablethere's a whole bunch of programs that are out there that, as we get through the heat wave, that we'rewell, as we get by this worst part, that we're able to invest in the communities to keep it from happening as badly next time it occurs.
And so I'm looking forward to working with you, and I thank you for your leadership.
Mr. Mayor, how are you doing, man?
[Mayor Ronald A. Nirenberg of San Antonio, TX, spoke via videoconference as follows.]
Mayor Nirenberg. Doing great, Mr. President.
The President. I hope the air I hope the air conditioning is working. [Laughter]
Mayor Nirenberg. So far, so good, Mr. President. It's great to be here with you and your team and with Mayor Gallego.
And I first want to start by thanking you, Mr. President, for the invitation today and want to extend my sincerest gratitude for your administration for the wealth of the support that San Antonio communities garnered through extensive and substantive investments in our housing stockaffordable housing stock, our workforce training efforts, as well as sustainable physical infrastructure.
But today we are here to talk about what has become a dangerous heat wave across large swaths of the southern part of our country, including here in Texas. To that end, San Antonio is certainly thankful for a President who's willing to tackle this urgent crisis in an equitable manner.
The bipartisan infrastructure law and the Inflation Reduction Act's commitment to the Justice40 climate initiative is also reflected on our local San Antonio Climate Ready Plan, as 75 percent of San Antonio's population are communities of color disproportionately impacted by decades of local inaction.
The President. Yes.
Mayor Nirenberg. But times are changing, thankfully. Sustainability and green energy are no longer four-letter words in the State of Texas. We will
The President. At least among most of you Texansat least among most Texans. [Laughter]
Mayor Nirenberg. Well, I'm happy to say that
The President. I'm not
Mayor Nirenberg. here in San Antonio, we've taken leadership. And
The President. You have.
Mayor Nirenberg. and in 2028, we will end the use of coal in San Antonio, which is nearly 40 years ahead of schedule.
And in large part because of you, Mr. President, San Antonio will launch its first-ever Advanced Rapid Transit line, bona fide mass transit for the city of San Antonio, a service that will only include low- or no-emission vehicles.
And so, as San Antonio works towards greener development in transit, we're also doing our policy work. Ourwe changed our development code last year to require 240-volt level 2 chargers in all new single-family homes. We're also providing incentives for those chargers in multifamily residences.
And also having the Nation's largest municipally owned utility, San Antonio has now become the fifth largest solar producer in the United States and tops in Texas
The President. Congratulations on that, by the way. Congratulations.
Mayor Nirenberg. Thank you very much. We're going to reach for number one in the country. We're number one in Texas, but we're not going to stop.
However, these initiatives are justare not just happening in San Antonio. I'm pleased to report mayors are united in Texas as well. Communities across Texas have committed themselves to being greener, more equitable, and literally cooler, as nearly every major Texas city now has a long-term climate or emissions reduction strategy.
So, working with our partners at the White House, with you and your team, I'm confident that the State best known for oil and gas production can help lead the way to a greener tomorrow.
So thank you again to your entire team, Mr. President, for your efforts to help us realize a better tomorrow for us, for our children, and for our grandchildren.
The President. Well, Ron, thank you. And I'm not being solicitous when I say this: You know, most people don't realize that Texas is one of the States that has the most significantits energy is most significantly supplied by wind and solar, in Texasin Texas.
And I know there are some in your State that want to changeturn that around. But it's working, and it's moving in a big way. And it's cheaper. It's cheaper.
Mayor Nirenberg. And it saved our necks in this heat wave too, by the way.
The President. Well, I think so. For real. I mean, look, most people havegrew up in families like I did, where you've just got to worry about one day to the next and getting enough food on the table. I mean, not poor but you know, just taking care of business, making sure your kids are okay.
But Ithe change that's taking place in Texas as it relates to dealing with the generation of energy is really magnificent. I mean, it's really incredible.
And I'm sure thatanyway, I won'tI shouldn't get into all that. But the fact isyou know, while your long-term plans take shape, what are you doing in the near term to protect your residents from the heat wave?
Mayor Nirenberg. Well, I certainly appreciate that question and very much appreciate the actions that you're taking today, Mr. President, through the Department of Labor.
As you know, Texas cities are in a battle with the State for local control. But we're going to do everything possible to protect our most vulnerable workers, especially those outdoor workers, for basic things like being able to access water breaks.
The President. Yes.
Mayor Nirenberg. San Antonio also is the firsttaking a page from Mayor Gallego's book, we're the first major city in Texas to pilot a citywide cool pavement initiative.
I'm also pleased to report that, next week, city council will vote to allocate an additional $4 million for tree planting, for mitigating our urban heat island effect.
And for the most immediate needs right now during this heat islandor during this heat wavewe have 80 cooling centers located all around the citypools, splash pads, libraries, et cetera. And we're offering free transportation to any resident who needs to get located into one of those indoor cooling centers.
And for our homeless population, we are conducting extensive outreach to make sure that we can get them into cool places and nobody is out there in the elements.
The President. Well, thank you. And look, don't hesitate to call us direct. For real.
I mean, there's so muchno, I really mean it. There's so much out there that we can do. And we've funded an awful lot of this.
For example, the idea that you can't have mandatory water breaks when you're working on a construction? Hell, when I played football, if you had a coach who, during the springduring summer practice, didn't provide water, you know, on a regular basis, he got in trouble or got fired. I mean, what are we doing here? What's going on with some of this stuff?
Both of you aretotally different place. But people just need to know where to go and what to do. And we're going to provide a lot of help across the board. And I'm looking forward to working with both of you.
For example, we shouldon the international effort, we've got a commitment to, you know, plant a billion trees over the next several years worldwide. I mean, there's a reason whyanyway, you guys get it. Andbut we've got to get through this crisis in the near term, and we've got to keep people safe.
And I really appreciate it. Because, look, I think talking to you bothpeople make judgments about whether you have a heart or not, whether you really arewhether it's just rote, you're telling them, or you care.
I mean this sincerely; you guys know this. Well, you both care, and it comes across. And so people are more inclined to say, ""Okay, I'll take a chance on maybe going to that center, or maybe I'll take a chance on doing A, B, C, or D.""
People are reluctant. And what you're both doing substantively, what we're going to be able to help you do more substantively, but what you're doing and the way you're doing it, I really admire you for doing it. I really mean it.
So thank you, thank you, thank you. Appreciate it.
And I want to thank my team for the work they're doing too to combat extreme heat and other historic weather emergencies we're seeing all across the country.
We are making progress. But as we've heard today, we have a lot more work to do.
I look forward to working with not justjust this twothese two wonderful mayors, but officials all across on the frontlines and local officials. Local officials are where the rubber meets the road, no pun intended. It'sreally matters.
We're committed to getting you what you need to keep your community safe, because no one knows what you need more for your communities than you guys. And so thank you, thank you, thank you.
And I mean it: Don't hesitate to contact any of the departments standing behind me. We have some of the funds. We're workinggoing to get more. And I think we can make a difference.
So thank you both. And as my mother would say, ""God love you.""
Thanks. See you all.
Q. Mr. President, are you[inaudible]pardoning your son? [Inaudible]pardon for your son?

2023-07-27 00:00:00,Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni of Italy,"
President Biden. Well, it's a delight to welcome the Prime Minister. We have become friends. And it's good to have you back at the White House. Thank you for coming.
Prime Minister Meloni. Thank you.
President Biden. And let me offer my condolences over thein Italy and throughout the Mediterranean, to those suffering from extreme, extreme weather and wildfires. Italy and the region are grappling with this, just as we are here in the United States.
I just did a major initiative on the dangers of this excessive heat here in the United States. And we're grappling with it as well.
And as NATO allies, the transatlantic partnership is the cornerstone of our shared security. And the Italian troops are playing a critical role in Europe, in the Mediterranean, and beyond.
Italy and the United States are also standing strong with Ukraine. And I compliment you on your very strong support in defending against Russian atrocities. And that's what they are. It's not just a war, but they'reRussia is committing atrocities that they're focusing on. Well, I don't want to get into it.
But you knowand I thank the Italian people. I want to thank them for supporting you in supporting Ukraine. It makes a big difference.
Today we're going to talk about our deepening economic connections, which fueled more than $100 billion in trade last year. In my view, there's no reason why that can't increase. And we're also expanding the partnership in new areas, including space cooperation and strengthening our support for developing countries. And I look forward to our discussion today on Mediterraneanthe work with Mediterranean nations to address the legitimate migration challenges you have coming in from Africa.
And Italy is going to be leading the G-7 this next time around andnext year. And I also look forward to pursuing an ambitious agenda for progress. And I hope you'll be nice to me as the chairman. [Laughter]
Thank you.
Prime Minister Meloni. Thank you.
President Biden. Please.
Prime Minister Meloni. Thank you. I am very pleased to be here today to testify the deep friendship that bonds the United States and Italy. I want to thank President Biden for his hospitality. And this closeness is based on common values and cultural roots.
And our bond was made strong by the contribution of millions of Americans of Italian origin. And that means Italy is an integral part of the great American nation and contributed in shaping its culture and identity.
And also for that, our relations are historically strong. They cross governments and remain solid regardless of their political colors.
We know who our friends are in times that are tough. And I think that Western nations have shown that they can rely on each other much than some have believed.
Moreover, after the Russian aggression against Ukraine, for all together we decided to defend the international law. And I'm proud that Italy, from the beginning, played its part in it. We did it simply because supporting Ukraine means defending the peaceful coexistence of people and states everywhere in the world.
Contrary to what some claim, Ukrainian resistance distances a world war. It does not bring it closer, as some say. Those who believe in peace should be the first supporters of the Ukrainian cause.
And then, Italy and the United States have important common interests in enhancing, as well, a global trade that is not only free, but also fair. Competition from other nations that do not meet our standards in terms of worker protection, safety, environmental protection undermine our companies and workers.
So free trade without rules has shown its limits. We must find the right balance between openness and the protection of our economyeconomies and strategic interests.
And similarly, we will discuss also these within the West. We must work together to support our industrial system by fostering convergence on our national interests. In this respect, dialogue between usbetween Italy, Europe, United Statescan avoid counterproductive tension to the benefit of everyone.
And on the other hand, we also need to be fair with nations that feel they have been exploited of their resources and that they show distrust towards the West. President Biden knows I take care a lot about Africa, about the role that we can play in these countries that can help us, building with them a new relation based on a new approach, which is a peer-to-peer approach. Also to fight illegal migration and all the problems that we face.
It's all things that we will discuss in the G-7 Presidency of Italy next year.
And then, United States is our most important trade partner outside European Union. And I thinkI do agree with you, Joethat our trade partnership is very high, but no reason why we could not improve it.
So thank you very much for hosting us, and thank you for your time.
President Biden. Well, I think you made an interesting point about the closeness and how many Italian Americans there are here.
And I just want you to know I was raised in a neighborhood where I felt self-conscious my name didn't end in ""o."" And I want you to know I'm the only non-Italian named Man of the Year by the Italian Society.
And Iwhen I got the award, I said to everybody what[inaudible]wanted to know what I was going to say. I said, ""You know, I was thinking about this."" I named all the guys and families I grew up with[inaudible]. Anyway, I went through the list. And I said: ""I was thinking about it. I deserve this award."" [Laughter]
Andbut I may be Irish, but I'm not stupid. I married Dominic Giacoppo's granddaughter. Just want you to know that. Okay? So be nice to me. All right? [Laughter]
Prime Minister Meloni. Now I know it.
President Biden. Anyway, thank you all very much.
Prime Minister Meloni. Thank you very much.

2023-07-27 00:00:00,Remarks at the Truman Civil Rights Symposium,"
Hello, hello. Thank you. Pleaseplease be seated.
You know, I had an opportunity to meet members of the Truman Board. And we were talking about all that Harry Truman did. And I was remindedand I willI'm going to send thethe Truman Library a copy of it.
My grandpop was an Irishman named Ambrose Finnegan. And I lived in Scranton untiluntil the economy just drew down and there was no work. My dad was a salesperson. And we moved down to DelawareClaymont, Delaware.
We would go home all the time to Scranton. And one day, we went back toI was back in Scranton, and a lot of my friendsI moved there to Delaware when I was in third grade, but we had been home a lot. We still called Scranton home andand we were up there on St. Patrick's Day when I was 14 years old. And I was standing on the corner watching everybody go by; they're going to the event.
And Harry Truman was a speaker at the Truman Dinner that year. And thesort of the David Broder of the Scranton Timesit was a guy named Tommy Phillips, who was an elderly manyounger than me, but elderly man[laughter]who was the chief political reporter. And they got a pictureand I hadn't thought about it a long time, but I'll send it over to the libraryof me at 14 years old standing on the corner in aand it was a warm day for February. And I'm standing on the corner in long-sleeve shirt with my buddies.
And President Truman was coming around the corner, coming off of Dimmick Avenue, and he was in a convertible. And purely by accidentI assume it was an accidentthe photographer from the newspaper got a picture of me making eye contact with Harry Truman. It was justI'm sure a lot of people made eye contact with him[laughter]but I was looking and you can see in the photograph we're looking at one another eye to eye. And that's when thisTommy Phillips, the David Broder of the day in Scranton, wrote, ""That's when Joe Biden knew he was going to be President."" [Laughter]
I knew I was going to be President when Jim Clyburn went ahead and endorsed me. That's when I knew I was going to be President. Thank you, Jim.
This is a great honor to be here tonight, and I mean that sincerely.
Summer 1918. The first warworld war. A train moves through the outskirts of Paris. An American Army captain rides alongside an all-White regiment heading to the frontlines.
A son of a slave State, the grandson of slaveowners, Captain Harry S. Truman looks through his glasses toward the blood-stained soil of the Second Battle of the Marne that ended just a few months before. It was a pivotal victory that led the vital part of America'sled by the vital part of America's 369th Infantry Regiment: the Harlem Hellfighters, an all-Black regiment that spent 191 days on the front, longer than any unit of its size in history.
A link in a distinguished line of ancestors and descendants, enslaved and free, risking their lives in every war since our founding for ideals they hadn't fully known on American soil: equality and freedom. A fearless captain on a consecrated battlefield in a segregated military. A snapshot in time of the work of all time to redeem the soul of America, which we're still struggling to do.
Representatives Clyburn and Cleaver, the Truman family, and leaders of the Truman Institute, distinguished guests, my fellow Americans, I speak to you tonight not from a battlefield, but from another sacred place: the National Archives, home of timeless words that point to our North Star.
A light for the dreams and the pains of centuries of enslaved people in America.
An idea once the most simple and the most powerful idea in the history of the world: that we're all created equal, endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights, and deserve to be treated with equality not just in the beginning, but throughout our lives.
A covenanta covenant we made with each other so central to who we are that we enshrined it in our Declaration of Independence: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident."" Our Constitution: ""We the people."" Our Bill of Rights: with the freedom of religion, speech, press, assembly, and more. All safeguarded in this hallowed place.
History requires us to acknowledge that we have never fully lived up to the promise of America captured in the essence of these documents. But our aspirations to be a more perfect Union ensure that we never fully walked away from it either.
Just like Armyjust like the Army captain who became President of the United States of America walked toward our North Star when he signed Executive Orderthat Jim mentioned9981 that desegregated the United States Armed Forces on July 26, 194875 years as of yesterday.
Harry Truman, born in Missouri to a family and community that embraced the Confederate sympathies. But savage violence and venom toward Black veterans and the power of the civil rights movement changed his mind and his heart.
Guided by a prayer he memorized as a child, and the prayer went like this: ""Oh, almighty and everlasting God, creator of Heaven, Earth, and universe, help me to be, to think, to act what is right because it is right."" That was the prayer he memorized, and Ihistory says he spoke to.
When the time came, Harry Truman did whata very American thing: He rose to the occasion, and he chose to do right.
The American military had been segregated since our founding, yet hundreds of thousandshundreds of thousands of people of color, men and women, still courageously served with a love of country that often didn't love them back.
They served in our Revolutionary War, declaring independence from a king only to be enslaved by a master. They protected the Union in the Civil War only to face disunion under Jim Crow. They sacrificed during two World Wars, fighting against autocracy only to be denied the freedom of their own democracy.
They are patriots like the Buffalo Soldiers: legends for their valor in combat. The Tuskegee Airmen, flying more than 15,000 sorties into battle.
Native Americans serving in our military at the highest rate of any demographic and nearly five times the national average.
Hispanic Americans, like those in the 65th RegimentInfantry Regiment helping liberate a Nazi concentration camp and protect Allied roads and airfields and posts.
Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, like the 442d Regimental Combat Team liberating Europe, a team that included one of my dearest and closest friends and a mentor of mine when I got here as a 29-year-old kid: the late Senator Danny Inouye, who served in the Senate with another friend, a great Hawaiian veteran: the late Senator Daniel Akaka.
The list goes on, including rank-and-file cooks, custodians, secretaries, mailmen, too often overlooked and forgotten, but made it work.
Yet, when these veterans came home, they were still denied equal opportunity in housing, education, jobs, even marriage. Families held in incarceration camps. Many of them denied the benefits of the GI bill because the Statesthe States put up barriers to be able to collect that GI benefit. And targeted in racist violence that was callous and all too often casual and common.
Let me take you back to 1946. Jim already spoke to this: February, South Carolina. Sergeant Isaac Woodard, a decorated Black World War II veteran, saw 3 years of war in the Pacific. Returning home to finally see his family, he asked the bus driver to stop so he could use the restroom. Instead, the driver called the police.
On arrival, the cops pulled him off the bus while he was still in uniform, beat him so badly they permanently blinded him. Beat him so badly they blinded him. And he was in his uniform.
I'm still astounded by the cruelty and viciousness.
Sergeant Woodard reunited with his family, but he could never look into their eyes again.
Five months later, July in Georgia. Army veteran George Dorsey, who spent 5 years in the Pacifichome with his wife for just 10 months. They were driving with his brother-in-law and sister, who was 7 months pregnant, when a White mob attacked them, pulled them from their car, and fired 60 shots6060 shots at close range, leaving their bodies barely identifiable.
My God, how sick. It's unbelievable what racism fueled by ignorance can unleash in this country.
The next month, August 1946, in response to similar acts of racist terror, a 17-year-old college student wrote a letter to the Atlanta Constitution, and here's what he said. He said, quote, ""We want and are entitled to the basic rights and opportunities of every American citizen."" End of quote.
That was a college student at Morehouse College. His name was Martin Luther King, Jr.
But a young King wasn't the only person awakened. A President was awakened as well.
Harry Truman felt a moral imperative to respond to the mistreatment of Black veterans. He heard their calls for a ""Double Victory"" to win freedom abroad and at home. He felt the urgency from civil rights leaders like A. Philip Randolph and the NAACP.
An unlikely character in the civil rights story of America, Harry Truman set his sights on our North Star. He created the President's Commission on Civil Rights that issued the groundbreaking report entitled, ""To Secure These Rights""that was the title, ""To Secure These Rights""condemning segregation and outlawingoutlining, I should say, changes in law and policy: protecting the right to vote, prohibiting discrimination in jobs and transportation, desegregating the military, and much more.
But as you might guess, the backlash was instantinstant.
A friend wrote to him, pleading to change course, but President Truman wrote back, quote: ""I am asking for equality of opportunity for all human beings. And as long as I stay here, I'm going to continue to fight."" End of quote.
Members of his own party, members of the military rejected the civilhis civil rights agenda. Undeterred, Harry Truman acted. And we're much better a nationa much better nation for his courage and commitment and for the sacrifice and service of all our patriots who fought for our democracy.
This year commemorates two other significant milestones: the 75th anniversary of women in the military and the 50th anniversary of an All-Volunteer Force. And as Commander in Chief, I'm honored to oversee the greatest fighting forceliterally, not figurativelyin the history of the world. And that's not hyperbole. And I might add: the most diverse fighting force in the history of the world. And, folks, these two parts are notthese two points are not unrelated.
More than 40 percent of our Active Duty force are people of color. Forty percent. About 20 percent are women, up from just 2 percent in 1948. A fighting immigrant force and those native born, hailing from big cities, suburbs, small towns, Tribal communities.
As our military became more diverse, it became stronger, tougher, and more capable, proving our diversity is a strength, not a weakness; a necessary part of our warfighting and our deterrence and our successful military operations.
And our unity out of many, not division, ensures good order and discipline, unit cohesion, effectiveness, and military readiness. We've seen it with generations of patriots, regardless of who they are mentored by and trained by. Fellow servicemen from every background, like my friend, the late Colin Powellhe was a friend.
Like so many veterans I've had the privilege to award our Nation's highest honors. Working toward the same mission, forming lifelong friendships, returning home to put on civilian clothes and enrich every part of American life. Bonding through a deep love of our Nation that draws our greatest strengths and our greatest strategic assets the full talents of all the American peopleand I mean that. Think about it. The fullof all the American people.
Some of you are tired of hearing me saying it, but I've been saying it for many years: We have many obligations as a government. We only have one truly sacred obligation: to prepare and equip those we send into harm's way and care for them and their families when they come home and when they don't.
For me and my wife Jill, for our family, it's personal, like many of you.
Among the most important duties, Jill and I have stood at Arlington to undertake the rite of remembrance so we have back homeas we have back home in Delaware for our son, Major Beau Biden, Bronze Star, Conspicuous Service Medal.
In fact, Jill couldn't be here tonight because she just returned from Europe, where she paid her respects at the Brittany American Cemetery, the final resting place of thousands of Americans, World War II troops.
It matters to Vice President Harris and our entire administration. It matters that we have the best leaders to lead the best force in the world that represent our entire country. From my perspective, that's America. That's America.
It includes the first-ever Black Secretary of Defense, who wanted to be here tonight, but he's traveling to the Indo-Pacific to strengthen our security ties in the region. Secretary Lloyd Austin, a decorated former four-star general, a warfighter with more than 40 years of service embodying the very spirit of why we are here tonight.
And there is Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks, a prodigious scholar and leader, the first woman confirmed as Deputy Secretary of Defense. It's alsoI also got confirmed two four-star generals that lead our commonour combatant commands, the second and third women in history to do so. It matters.
But something dangerous is happening. I've worked across the aisle my entire career; I think my colleagues will attest to that. I have good friends who are Republicans. We disagree. A guy I disagree like the devil with, but is a decent and honorable man and does what he says is the Republican leader in the Senate. We disagree on almost everything.
The Republican Party used to always support the military. But today, they are undermining the military. The senior Senator from Alabama, who claims to support our troops, is now blocking more than 300 military operations [nominations; White House correction] with his extreme political agenda.
Like General C.Q. Brown, F-16 pilot and a wing commander and the first African American to lead any branch of the Armed Service to be the next Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. That's who I've nominated. He's waiting.
Admiral Lisa Franchetti, the second woman in our Navy ever to achieve the rank of four-star admiral, who I chose to bemake history again as the first woman as Chief of Naval Operations.
I've also nominated other outstanding leaders of all backgrounds. We need them.
Right now tens of thousands of America's daughters and sons are deployed around the world tonight keeping us safe from immense national security challenges. But the Senator from Alabama is not. For the first time in more than 100 years, we don't have a sitting confirmed Commandant of the Marine Corps. By the fall, we may not have a Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. We might not have the military leaders for our Army and Navy either.
This partisan freeze is already harming military readiness, security, leadership, and troop morale; freezing pay; freezing people in place. Military families who have already sacrificed so much, unsure of where and when they change stations, unable to get housing or start their kids in the new school because they're not there yet. Military spouses forced to take critical career decisions, not knowing where or if they can apply for a new job.
A growing cascade of damage and disruption, all because one Senator from Alabama and 48 Republicans who refuse to stand up to him, to lift the blockade over the Pentagon policy offering service men and women, their families access to reproductive health care rights they deserve if they're stationed in States that deny it.
I think it's outrageous. But don't just take it from me. Hundreds of military spouses petitioned to end the extreme blockade. One spouse referencing the Senator from Alabama said, quote: ""This isn't a football game. This nonsense must stop right now."" Enough.
It's time for the Senate to confirm the next Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the next Commandant of the Marine Corps. It's time for servicemembers to receive the pay and promotions they've earned and deserve. It's time for the Senator of Alabama to let these generals and admirals fully serve their country and servicemembers care for themselves and their families.
I urge Senate Republicans to do what they know is right: Keep our country safe like Harry Truman. Approve all those outstanding military nominees nownownowwhich was routine in the past, I might add.
And enough with the attacks on our military from those voices slandering American military, saying it's becoming weak, soft, and less capable.
We hear it from the senior Senator from Missouri, who held his fist high in salute of January 6 even as veterans turned police officers protected him and our Nation as insurrectionists held a dagger at the throat of democracy.
We hear it from the junior Senator from Texas who fell for Russian propaganda suggesting that their militarythe Russian militarywas better than ours, calling our military ""emasculated."" Where the he- [laughter]sorry.
Frankly, they have no idea what in God's name they're talking about.
As Commander in Chief, I can tell you without reservationnot just being in this business for a long time, but being a student of historywe have and always will have the strongest, toughest[inaudible]forcefighting force in the history of the world. And, again, that's not hyperbole. That's real.
I'm sorry to go on, but, as my grandpop would say, this gets my goat. [Laughter]
Let me close with this: In June of 1865, a major general from the Union Army arrived in Galveston, Texas, to enforce the Emancipation Proclamation and free the last enslaved Americans from bondage. Juneteenth, a day that reflects the Psalmwhat the Psalm tells us, quote, ""Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.""
Last month, 2 years after I made Juneteenth a Federal holidaythe first new Federal holiday since Martin Dr. Martin Luther King Day, nearly 40 years agoI hosted a Juneteenth concert at the White Housethe beacon of our Republic, I might add, built by enslaved people.
Watching their descendantsstudents, dancers, singersperform in that lawn of the White House was spiritual. To think thousandsthousandsof Black Union soldiers killed during the Civil War. To think enslaved people remained shackled 2 years after emancipation. To think how many long nights they looked to the light and the North Star to keep the faith that despite America's original sin of slavery, this Nation could be saved.
That is patriotism. That's patriotism.
During that powerful concert, we heard the great Jennifer Hudson sing from her soul about the glory that will come and echo an anthem of a movement. I can't sing, so I'm not even going to try. [Laughter] But I'll quote, ""It's been a long time coming, but I know a change is gonna come. Oh, yes, it will.""
That's what happened 75 years ago when an American President chose to do right. And that's what we commemorate tonight: a forward march in our own lives, in the life of the Nation, toward the North Star, the idea of America that beats in the heart of all of our people.
I know we'll do this. I've never been more optimistic about America's future. Let us reflect and repair. Let us rise to the occasion and redeem the soul of this Nation, treat each other with decency and respect, change the dialogue.
Let's remember who in God's name we are. We are the United States of America, and there's nothingthink about thisliterally, there is nothing we've ever set our mind to we haven't accomplishednothing, everif we decided we were going to do it. Nothing beyond our capacity when we act together.
So let's reach out, even to those who haveless than generous. Try to pull them in so we can act together.
And I mean this from the bottom of my heart: May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.

Joseph R. Biden, Remarks at the Truman Civil Rights Symposium Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/363558 "
2023-07-25 00:00:00,Remarks on Signing a Proclamation on the Establishment of the Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley National Monument,"
Vice President Kamala D. Harris. Good afternoon, everyone. Please have seat. Good afternoon.
To our President, Joe Biden; Members of Congress; the members of the Till family; and my fellow Americans: Today we gather to remember our history. We gather to remember an act of astonishing violence and hate and to honor the courage of those who called upon on our Nation to look with open eyes at that horror and to act.
The story of Emmett Till and the incredible bravery of Mamie Till-Mobley helped fuel the movement for civil rights in America, and their stories continue to inspire our collective fight for justice.
When I served in the United States Senate, I was so profoundly honored to sponsor the Emmett Till Antilynching Act alongside Congressman Bobby Rush. And it was an even greater honor to stand beside our President, Joe Biden, as he signed the law that finally made lynching a Federal crime. So many leaders here today made that progress possible.
Our history as a nation is born of tragedy and triumph, of struggle and success. That is who we are. And as people who love our country, as patriots, we know that we must remember and teach our full history, even when it is painfulespecially when it is painful.
Today, there are those in our Nation who would prefer to erase or even rewrite the ugly parts of our past; those who attempt to teach that enslaved people benefitted from slavery; those who insult us in an attempt to gaslight us, who try to divide our Nation with unnecessary debates.
Let us not be seduced into believing that somehow we will be better if we forget. We will be better if we remember. We will be stronger if we remember. Because we all here know: It is only by understanding and learning from our past that we can continue to work together to build a better future.
And so now it is my great honor to introduce a leader who has dedicated his life to preserving and protecting our history. And Reverend Wheeler Parker, Jr., just also shared with me that he and his wife will be celebrating this weekend their fifty
Reverend Wheeler Parker, Jr. Sixth.
Vice President Harris. sixth anniversary of marriage. [Laughter]
Reverend Wheeler Parker, Jr.
Rev. Parker. In fact, we were married 56 years on Sunday. My wife say, ""When we get to heaven, I'm going to say, 'Lord, not up here too.'"" [Laughter] I see we have a whole lot of amens to that. [Laughter]
I'm truly humbled by this honor. You see, I was born in Mississippi. I spent my early years as a sharecropper and was focused up on filling up a 9-foot sackfocused up on my quota, not making history. From the outhouse to the White House[laughter]from a time when we lived in fear to a time when President and Vice President gave us this great hopekept their promise by deliveringthis is what America means to me: promises made, promises kept.
It has been quite a journey for me from the darkness to the light. When I set with my family on the night of terrorwhen Emmett Till, our beloved Bobo, was taken from us, taken to be tortured and brutally murderedback then, when I was overwhelmed with terror and fear of certain death in the darkness of a thousand midnights, in a pitch-black house on what some have called Dark Fear Road. Back then, in the darkness, I could never imagine a moment like this: standing in the light of wisdom, grace, and deliverance.
There is something amazing you feel when you meet President Biden, like I did when he signed the Emmett Till Antilynching lawAntilynching bill into law. He welcomed me into this place of great power. I felt the power of his personal devotion: his devotion to justice, to equality, his commitment to keeping the promise of America. This came from his heart, from his soul.
God bless you, President Biden, for all you have done and will do to preserve our history.
Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in recognizing President Joe Biden.
[At this point, Rev. Parker spoke briefly off-mike to the President.]
The President. I'm not going to tell you what he whispered to me. [Laughter] Thank you, Reverend Parker. And thank all of you for being here.
I want to thank Kamala for hernot only capacity to do what she does, but the fire with which she brings to the things she cares a lot about.
To all the Members of Congress, including Representative Bennie Thompson, Senator Tammy Duckworth, Representative Danny Davis, and Senator Dick Durbin, who iswe wish a speedy recovery from COVID; he's just recovering from COVID right nowand who have long fought to honor the Till family. It's not new to any of them.
To the Till family, it's an honor to be with you again.
You know, when I was preparing these remarks, I quite franklyand my colleagues will understand thisI found myself trying to temper my anger as I was writing it. I'm not joking. I can't fathomI can't fathom what it must have been like. It's hard to believe I was 12 years old, and I justyou know, I know no matter how much time has passedhow many birthdays, how many events, how many anniversariesit's hard to relive this. It brings it all back.
We were talking about, Rev, as if it happened yesterdaythe images in your head, and you things you remember. But it's inspiring to see how many of your family have continued as mother's courage to find faith in pain, purpose in pain. That's a remarkable thing, it seems to me.
Insisting on an open casket for her murdered and, I might add, maimed and mutilated son. Fourteen years old. Fourteen years old. She said, ""Let the people see what I've seen."" Let the people see what I have seen.
My God, all of us who have lost children in other ways, how hard it is even to close the casket or keep it open or towhat a debate it is. But to see the child that had been maimed, and the country and the world sawsawnot just heard the story of Emmett Till and his motheras a story of a family's promise and loss and the Nation's reckoning with hate, violence, racism, overwhelming abuse of power, and brutality. It's hard to fathom. Hard to fathom this even in war for me. It's hard to fathom.
But today, on what we've beenwould have been Emmett's 82d birthday, we add another chapter to the story of remembrance and healing. Just as we joined together when I signed the law in his name to make lynching a Federal crimeand think how long that took for that to happenI meanand we screened the movie ""Till"" at the White Housetoday we join together as I sign a proclamation designating Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley National Monument in both Illinois and in Mississippi.
When we ended lynching as a matter of law, we talked about wanting to do this. But the support from the community has been so overwhelming. I thank the Members of Congress for their support and, more than that, their leadership.
At a time when there are those who seek to ban books, bury history, we're making it clearcrystal, crystal clear[applause]while darkness and denialism can hide much, they erase nothing. They can hide, but they erase nothing.
We can't just choose to learn what we want to know. We have to learn what we should know. We should know about our country. We should know everything: the good, the bad, the truth of who we are as a nation. That's what great nations do, and we are a great nation. That's what they do.
For only with truth comes healing, justice, repair, and another step forward toward forming a more perfect Union. We've got a hell of a long way to go.
That's what's happening. That's what's going to happen with visitors of all backgrounds to learn the history of Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley through our national monument.
Look, telling the truth and the full history of our Nation is important. It's important to our children, our grandchildren, and our great-grandchildren, to our Nation as a whole.
I've said it before. It was a lesson I learned coming out of thenot like real leaders in the civil rights movementbut when I came out of the civil rights movement as a kid, as a public defender. And I used toyou know, I used to saythink that if you pass something that was good, you can make hate go away.
Hate never goes away. It just hides. It hides under the rocks. And given a little bit of oxygen by bad people, it comes roaring out again.
And it's up to all of us to deal with that, up to all of us to stop it. Up to all of us. The best way to do that is with the truth. It's used in a different context, but I think it's applyapplies here. Silence is complicity. I will not be silent, nor will you be silent about what happened.
There's really critical work ahead to continue the fight for racial justice and equality for all Americans. And my administration is committed to leading a path forward. And I know the Members of Congress here are even more committed than that.
I'm going to close with this. The reason the world saw what Mrs. Till-Mobley saw was because another hero in this story: the Black press.
Audience members. Yes!
The President. No, I'm serious. Jet Magazine, the Chicago Defender, and other newspapers and radio announcers who told the story were unflinching in the bravery with which they told that story, making sure America sawsawwhat they saw.
Ida B. Wells once said, quote, ""The way to right wrongs is to turn the light of truth upon them."" The way to right wrongs is to shine a light of truth on them. Well, that's our charge today.
By the way, parenthetically, did you ever think we'd be talking about banning books in America? Banning history? I'm serious.
To the Till family and to all of you here today, I thank you for your courage and for never giving upnever, never giving up.
And before I say even what more is on my mind, I'm now going to leave this podium. [Laughter]
No, I mean, it's just barbaricbarbaricwhat happened. And seriously, all you moms out there, imagine the courage it took to say, ""Let them see."" The courage.
It's now my honor to sign this proclamation in memory of Emmett Till and Mrs. Mamie Till-Mobley.
And I thank you all for being here. And I amI know I'm considered too much of an optimist, but I believe if we keep pushing, we're going to continue to make progress. We're going to continue to make progress. And it's already being made.
The idea that when that 14-year-old was buried, that in this Indian Treaty Room there'd be this many people of color holding powerful office, changing the direction of the country, it would have been beyond our comprehension. And we're just getting started.
The proclamation I'm signing establishes the Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley National Monument.
Okay, ready?
The proclamation I'm signing establishes the Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley National Monument.
[The President signed the proclamation.]

2023-07-25 00:00:00,Remarks on Efforts To Expand Access to Mental Health Care,"
Please, have a seat. Richele, thank you for that introduction and the courage it takes to stand up[laughter]on national television in front of all these people and tell your story. But your story is the story of millions of people all across the country.
And you know, one of the things that the pandemic demonstrated is the need for a lot more help. Over a million people dead from COVID. And that's estimated to mean 8 million people left behind who were close to them. How many mornings people get up or show up for dinner and there's an empty chair? The impact on people's lives is profound.
Butand you were paying insurance every month. You know, you shouldn't be your ownwell, you shouldn't have to do what you had to do, going through one of the hardest things in life.
And by the way, Debbie, Debbie, DebbieGod love you. [Laughter] You're the best, Debbie. You really are. We wouldn't be here were it not for Debbie, and that's not athat's not an exaggeration. We served together for a long time in the Senate, and I've never known you not to be a significant advocate for this very issue.
And I want to thank Acting Secretary Su and everyone at the Department of Labor and HHS and Treasury for working to improve insurance coverage for mental health care in America.
And, folks, you know, I don't know what the difference between breaking your arm and having a mental breakdown is. It's health. There is no distinction. It's health. Vivek Murthy, who is our Surgeon General, and I talk about this issue a lot.
You know, in the last two State of the Union Addresses, I've laid out what I call the unity agenda. It is made up of four big things tothat we're going to do together as a nation. One of the things I'm always asked is: You know, why Americans have sort of lost faith for a while on beingbeing able to do big things.
""If you could do anything at all, Joe, what would you do?"" I said, ""I'd cure cancer."" And they looked at me like, ""Why cancer?"" Because no one thinks we can. That's why. And we can. We can end cancer as we know it.
Deliver on our sacred obligations to veterans is the second thing I think is critically important. Thirdly was beat the opioid epidemic, which we're still fighting very hard. And fourth was to tackle mental health crisis, which is why we're here today.
You know, we can all agree mental health care is health care. It is health care. It's essential to people's well-being and their ability to lead a full and productive life, to find joy, to find purpose, to take care of themselves and their loved ones. It's about dignity. Think about this.
My dad used to have an expression: Everyone is entitled to be treated with dignity. Imagine being a parent looking at your beautiful child you adore needing help and know you can't do a damn thing about it because you don't have the wherewithal. You can'ttalk about stripping a parent of their dignitytheir inability to help their child or their husband or their wife or their mother or their father or someone they adore.
But right now, for millions of Americans, mental health care and treatment for substance abuse is out of reach. It's out of reach. In 2020, less than halfless than halfof all adults with mental illness diagnosis received care for it. Less than half.
For children the numbers are even worse. Nearly 70 percent of our kids who seek care for mental health or addiction cannot get it. Seventy percent.
Talk to parents and teachers. Talk to the school nurses and counselors. Talk to young people. They'll tell you there's a serious youth mental health crisis happening right now in this country. We must fulfill the promise of true mental health parity for all Americans now. [Applause] Now.
And I might note, parenthetically: If we do, it saves the country billions of dollars. The idea that it's going toit saves.
Here is what it means. Almost 15 years ago, the bipartisan Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act became law. It called for health insurance companies to cover mental health care and treatment for substance abuse at the same levels of physical health care. Because just like when you break your bonea bone or have a heart attack, when you're having a mental health crisis, you should be able to get helpmedical help, professional help.
During the Obama-Biden administration, we worked hard to put a lawthis law into effect. And the result, by some important measures: There is greater paritynot nearly enoughgreater parity today than in the past.
Look, there's lower copays for mental health care, getting rid of some arbitrary limits on the number of times you can see your therapist each year. Plus, for the first time ever, the Affordable Care Act made mental health care an essential service, which means many health plans must cover it.
But there were many importantthese were important steps, but they weren't enough. We're still not where we need to be. We're still not there.
Insurers still make it far too difficult to get mental health care. Their networks of providers are badly inadequate, with far fewer psychiatrists, therapists, and other mental health professionals compared to all other mentalall other medical specialties.
And as a result, even with private insurance, patients are often forced to seek out-of-network care at significantly higher costs, if they can find it. Seeing a therapist can cost 200 bucks a visit or more. That's $800 a month if you have a session every week, which is often what patients need. Many familiesa significant number of familiescannot afford that.
And by the way, think aboutparenthetically, think about just how difficult it is to begin with, to say, ""I need help."" You break your arm, you have no trouble going to the emergency and""I need help."" You're having a mental crisis, it's hard. It's hard to say ""I need help."" ""I need help."" ""My child needs help."" And this is happening to millions of people.
People with insurance are twice as likely to have to go out-of-network for mental health care compared to physical health care. And that gap has only gotten wider.
As a result, folks with depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress, bipolar disorders, eating disorders, addiction, and other illnesses often go without care. Period. And you know thehow that ends, many times.
They try to power through and hope that they can manage on their own. Or they pay whatever it takes, spending down their savings, racking up credit card bills, or taking out second or third mortgages to get the care for themselves or their children.
Folks, it shouldn't be this way. It doesn't need to be this way.
I've heard from mental health professionals across the country describing a system that's falling short. One therapist wrote to me who primarily treats teenagers, including some who are having suicidal thoughts. And he said when his patients need to be hospitalized to save their lives, insurance companies often deny the claimsoften deny the claims.
Another clinical psychologist wrote me and described getting calls from desperate people who have called 20 different therapists looking for help, but can't find it. This therapist says, and I quote, ""I try to create time that I don't have to see more patients."" End of quote. ""I'm often the only person,"" he went on to say, ""who is able to call them back."" They never even get calls, most of the time.
And I've personally received letters from family members whose loved ones are suffering from mental illness, who describe how difficult it can be to help.
One woman wrote me, went on to sayabout her mother, a retired teacher who has a bipolar disorder. Her daughter wrote, quote, ""Too often, insurance companies dictate the standard of care when it actually needs to be care providers and family members who have more to say."" And she went on to say, ""Please advocate hard for the most vulnerable among us."" Well, that's exactly what my administration is trying to do.
Today my administration is announcing new steps to dramatically expand access to mental health care in America. Our plans would require health insurance plans to identify the gaps in the mental health care that they provide.
For example, they'd need to measure how many mental health providers are in their network, how much they are paying these providers, how difficult it is for someone to join their network, how often doctors have to get the so-called prior authorization before they can treat a patient.
Some of you have dealt with this more than once. You get referrals to see mental health specialists. But when you make the appointment, they say, ""I can't see you until your doctor submits the paperwork and gets special permission from the insurance company.""
Give me a break. [Laughter] It's ridiculous. It really is. [Applause] It's ridiculous. And it prevents people from getting the care they need.
Now insurance companiesnow insurers are going to measure how often they require prior authorization and how often they deny those requests.
Right now many health plans don't collect data. Under my administration's new plan, they would be required to collect that data.
And under the existing law, when facts reveal that mental health care is not being treated on par with physical health care, they would be required by law to fix it. Fix it, fix it, fix it.
And here's something else we're announcing today. When mentalwhen the Mental Health Parity Act was passed 15 years ago, there was a loophole. Health plans that are offered to State and local government employees did not have to comply with the Mental Health Parity Act. More than 200 health plans nationwide were left out. Now we're making it clear: They have to follow the law as well. They must follow the law as well.
This builds on the work we've done over the past 2 years with the expanded Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics. And I want to thank Debbie again, who for years worked to get this program up and running. She made sure it was funded in the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which I was proud to sign into law, the largest investment in mental health ever, ever, ever, ever. Thank you, Debbie.
These clinics provide a range of services, including crisis support available 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. And they serve anyone who needs care regardless of their ability to pay.
There are now 500 of these clinics in 46 States. We've added more than 140 during my administration. And we're going to keep increasing the number because you need more than the 500.
We've also launched a nationwide crisis hotline: 8excuse me9-8-8. Let me say that again: The crisis hotline is 9-8-8, where you can connect with a trained crisis counselor 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Over 5 million people have called that hotline since I launched it a year ago5 million. And we say we don't have a problem?
We've invested $1 billion to help schools hire, trainand train 14,000 new mental health counselors in schools across the country. And we're taking steps to address the harm of social media is doing to our young people. And it is doing harm.
We've got to hold[applause]. We've got to hold these platforms accountable for the national experiment they're conducting on our children for profit.
Later this week, Senators will debate legislation to protect kids' privacy online, which I've been calling for for 2 years. It matters. Pass it, pass it, pass it, pass it, pass it. [Laughter] I really mean it. Think about it. Do you ever get a chance to look at what your kids are looking at online?
Folks, the actions we're announcing today represent a real step forward to help millions of people get mental health care they need and their insurance should beand the insurance should be providedit should be provided. But there's still so much more to do.
Improving our mental health system means addressing the three C's: coverage, care, and causes. Today, we took a big step on coverage. Now we need to keep expanding care, for example, by increasing access to telemedicine; expanding our mental health workshopworkforcedoctors, therapists, and counselors. Expanding it.
We need to address prevention and the root cause of the pain and trauma that a lot of people are feeling, like loneliness and isolation, social media and online bullying, gun violence.
And there's stillwe're still feeling the profound loss of the pandemic. As I mentioned, we have over 100 [1 million; White House correction] people dead. That's 100 [1 million] empty chairs around the kitchen table. Every single loss, there are so many people left behind and broken-hearted.
Folks, this mental health crisis is something we need to face together as a country. We have a moral obligation, in my view, to be there for each other, to reach outreach to our neighbors in grief and stress and trauma and despair. Reach out to them to offer help or just a listening ear; to have the courage to ask for help when we need it. And it's hard, because we know that even when it feels as dark as it can get, we aren't alone. It's important for people to realize that they're not alone.
That's what I want everyonethat's what I want for everyone in America: not to feel isolated and alone, to know their country has their back and their President has their back.
Let me close with this. Many people will have to seek mental health care at some point in their lives. Whether you're in a red State, a blue State, it doesn't matter.
Mental health care can be life-changing and even lifesaving. For all those brave enough and strong enough to seek helpand I mean thatbrave enough and strong enough to seek help, we have to do better. Together, I know we will.
We just have to remember who we are, for God's sake. We're the United States of America. Thinkwe're the Unitedthere is nothing beyond our capacitynothingnothing beyond our capacity when we do it together.
So God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you so very much.

2023-07-21 00:00:00,Remarks on Artificial Intelligence,"
I'm the AI. [Laughter] If any of you think I'm Abe Lincoln, blame it on the AI.
First of all, thanks. Thanks for coming. And I want to thank my colleagues here for taking the time to come back again and again as we try to deal with thewe've joined by leaders of seven American companies who are driving innovation in artificial intelligence. And it is astounding.
Artificial intelligence orit promises an enormousan enormouspromise of both risk to our society and our economy and our national security, but also incredible opportunitiesincredible opportunities.
Just 2 months ago, Kamala and I met with these leadersmost of them are here againto underscore the responsibility in making sure that products that they are producing are safe and making them publicwhat they are and what they aren't. Since then, I've met with some of America's top minds in technology to hear the range of perspectives and possibilities and risk of AI.
Kamala can't be here because she's traveling to Florida, but she's met with civil society leaders to hear their concerns about the impacts on society and ways to protect the rights of Americans.
Over the past year, my administration has taken action to guide responsible innovation. Last October, we introduced the first-of-its-kind AI Bill of Rights. In February, I signed an Executive order to direct agencies to protect the public from algorithms that discriminate. In May, we unveiled a new strategy to establish seven new AI research institutes to help drive breakthroughs in responsible AI innovention [innovation; White House correction].
And today I'm pleased to announce that these seven companies have agreed to voluntary commitments for responsible innovation. These commitments, which the companies will implement immediately, underscore three fundamental principles: safety, security, and trust.
First, the companies have an obligation to make sure their technology is safe before releasing it to the public. That means testing the capabilities of their systems, assessing their potential risk, and making the results of these assessments public.
Second, companies must prioritize the security of their systems by safeguarding their models against cyber threats and managing the risks to our national security and sharing the best practices and industry standards that are necessary.
Third, the companies have a duty to earn the people's trust and empower users to make informed decisions: labeling content that has been altered or AI-generated, rooting out bias and discrimination, strengthening privacy protections, and shielding children from harm.
And finally, companies have agreed to find ways for AI to help meet society's greatest challengesfrom cancer to climate changeand invest in education and new jobs to help students and workers prosper from the opportunities, and there are enormous opportunities of AI.
These commitments are real, and they're concrete. They're going to help fulfillthe industry fulfill its fundamental obligation to Americans to develop safe, secure, and trustworthy technologies that benefit society and uphold our values and our shared values.
Let me close with this. We'll see more technology change in the next 10 years, or even in the next few years, than we've seen in the last 50 years. That has been an astounding revelation to me, quite frankly. Artificial intelligence is going to transform the lives of people around the world.
The group here will be critical in shepherding that innovation with responsibility and safety by design to earn the trust of Americans. And quite frankly, as I met with world leaders, allall ourall the G-7 is focusing on the same thing.
Social media has shown us the harm that powerful technology can do without the right safeguards in place. And I've said at the State of the Union that Congress needs to pass bipartisan legislation to impose strict limits on personal data collection, ban targeted advertisements to kids, require companies to put health and safety first.
But we must be clear eyed and vigilant about the threats emergingof emerging technologies that can posedon't have to, but can poseto our democracy and our values. Americans are seeing how advanced artificial intelligence and the pace of innovation have the power to disrupt jobs and industries.
These commitments are a promising step, but thewe have a lot more work to do together. Realizing the promise of AI by managing the risk is going to require some new laws, regulations, and oversight.
In the weeks ahead, I'm going to continue to take executive action to help America lead the way toward responsible innovation. And we're going to work with both parties to develop appropriate legislation and regulation. I'm pleased that Leader Schumer and Leader Jeffries and others in the Congress are making this a top bipartisan priority.
As we advance the agenda here at home, we'll lead the work withwe'll lead work with our allies and partners on a common international framework to govern the development of AI.
I think these leaders andI thank these leaders that are in the room with me today
[At this point, the President cleared his throat.]
and their partnershipexcuse meand their commitments that they're making. This is a serious responsibility, and we have to get it right. And there's enormous, enormous potential upside as well.
So I want to thank you all. And they're about to go down to a meeting, which I'll catch up with them later.
So thank you, thank you, thank you.
Q. Mr. President, can you tell us about the hacking of Cabinet officials by China and the threshold of concern you have about that sir?

2023-07-20 00:00:00,"Remarks on the National Economy in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","
Hello, Philly! Have a seat if you have one.
Emily, thank you for that introduction.
I tell you what, Mayor Kenney, thanks for the passport back into the city. I think the only reason that allows that to happen is, I married a Philly girl.
You know, they can't be here today. but I want to thank Governor Shapiro, who's doing a hell of a job, and to my friends Senator Bobby Casey and Senator Fetterman, who have been such great partners to me.
Folks, I want to also thank Representative Mary Gay Scanlon, who fights so hard for this district, and the other Members of Congress, Brendan Boyle, Chrissy Houlahan, Madeleine Dean, Joe Courtney. I tell you, theoh, Donald Norcross, by the way. Donald from across the way.
You know, I always kid Donald when, mayorMr. Mayor, I say, you know, Delaware is small, so we have to fight for every inch of territory. So there was a debate on whether or notwhether Delawarethe State of Delaware owned the Delaware River along the Delaware shore up to the highwater mark in New Jersey.
And they said, ""No."" We went to the Supreme Court, and they got something right. They said, yes, we do. Anyway[laughter]. I always kid them all the time.
Flooding in Bucks County, Pennsylvania 
Folks, look, before I begin, I want to say we're praying for those who lost their lives in the flooding in Bucks County. The idea that there's not global warming, I think, can't be denied by anybody anymore. Andat any rate.
We're grateful to all the first responders continuing to look for 2-year-old Mattie and her baby brother Conrad. With the grace of God, maybe something will come of it.
I want to thank Governor Shapiro and all the Bucks County officials and their leadership during that tragic time. We provided all we could from FEMA, but there's a lot to be done.
National Economy 
I'm here today to talk about what we're doing to invest in America, invest in Pennsylvania, invest in our clean energy futureand to talk about the progress we've made building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up.
You know, I came to office determined to strengthen the middle class. I often sayand I mean it sincerelyyou know, Wall Streetgood folks down there, but they didn't build the middle class, they didn't build America. The middle class was built by the middle class, and unions build the middle class, and it changed the economic direction of this country.
Because we have aI got tired of trickle-down economics. I've never been a big fan. If the wealthy do very wellI'm a capitalist. I like the wealthy to be able to be wealthy. But if theythe mere fact they do well doesn't mean that everybody else does well.
I watched my dad growing up. There was not a whole lot of benefit trickled down on his kitchen table as a consequence of trickle-down economics to what everyone from the Financial Times to the Wall Street Journal has become my changemya different philosophy. TheyI don't think they started off trying to be complimentary, but they started calling it ""Bidenomics.""
And our plan is workingBidenomics. We're here[applause]. And here's what it looks like. Over 13 million new jobs built across the country and nearly half a million of them here in Pennsylvania just in the last 2 years. Eight hundred thousand manufacturing jobs, twenty-eight thousand here in Pennsylvania alone in the last 2 years.
That's more jobs in 2 years than any President has created in a 4-year term. Unemployment is below 4 percentthe longest stretch of unemployment below 4 percent in the last 50 years. We're beginning to come back, folks. We can because we're giving workers a chance.
Unemployment is down. But to the surprise of a lot of economists, so is inflation. Remember the story? In order for inflation to come down, you've got to cut wages for hard-working folks, you've got to have unemployment up in order for inflation to come down.
Well, guess what? I never bought that. I don't think the problem in America is that too many people are working or that people are making too much money. Instead, we've focused on getting Americans into the workforce by fixing a broken supply chain, lowering the cost of product from everything from health care to the products we purchase.
The fact is, companies made record-high profits during the pandemic. And by the way, I'm not opposed to the companies. I come from the corporate capital of the world. [Laughter] More corporations are incorporated in Delaware than every other State in the Union. But everybody should pay their fair share. Everybody should pay their fair share.
Now they're coming down, and so is inflation. We need to keep bringing it downmarkups and the margins of their profits. It's one thing to make a profit; it's another thing to be excessive. You know, this is one of the most important ways to continue to make progress on inflation.
While we have to do more, inflation has slowed every single month in the last 12on a yearly basis for the last 12 months. How many times did you read that inflationthat a recession is coming? They evenin the Wall Streettoday said they don't see a recession coming now.
It's the lowest pointinflationthe lowest point in over 2 years. The U.S. has the lowest inflation rate of any major economy in the world, the so-called G-7. It's less than two-thirds of what it was a year ago, down from 9 percent to 3 percent and going to go down lower.
At the same time, pay for low-wage workers has gone up at a faster pace in over two decades. Wages are growing faster than inflation. That means a lot of working folks are beginning to be able to have a littlejust a little bit of breathing room.
According to the surveys, job satisfaction in America is at a 36-year high. We've got more work to do, but people are coming off the sidelines to work.
The share of working-age Americans in the workforce is as high as it's been in 20 years, including during every single day under my predecessor. And, folks, it's not an accident; it's my economic plan in action. It's Bidenomics.
Since I took office, we've attracted over half a trillion dollarsa half a trillion dollarsin private investment in American manufacturing and clean energy. That's what's been attracted to engage in these issues.
Instead of exporting jobsit used to be: find the cheapest market in the world, send the job overseas, and bring the product back. Not on my watch. Right herewhat we're doing, we're creating jobs in America, and we're exporting American products.
With the leadership of your Democratic Members of Congress, we passed the Inflation Reduction Actalthough a few Republicans did support itthe largest investment to combat climate evereveranywhere in the world. All of $368 billion.
We know the urgency. I don't hear many naysayers on climate deny the floods, the heatwaves, the wildfire smoke impacting so many Americans just this week alone. It's just spontaneous.
But we also have solutions. A lot of my friends in organized labor know: When I think climate, I think jobs. I think union jobs. Not a joke. Not a joke.
And this law is creating millions of good-paying clean energy manufacturing jobs, including offshore wind.
When I took office, I set a goal of producing 30 gigawatts of offshore energy wind by 2030. Thirty gigawatts is enough to power 10 million homes, and it will help put us on a path to 100-percent clean energy [electricity; White House correction] by 2035. By 2035, all of electricityyou turn on anyis all going to be clean energy.
It's not hypothetical. Construction is already underway in two major projects onoff the East Coast. And just within the last month, the Department of Interior advanced permitting on two more wind projects on the East Coast.
And here in the Philly Shipyard, Great Lakes Dredge and Dock is also stepping up to help meet the clean energy goals. Here today, workers in nine different unions will start building a vessel called the Acadia. It's going to place heavy rocks at the base of the offshore wind projects to stabilize them when they put these down, and it's going to projectprotect it against erosion.
It will be the first vessel of its kind that's made in AmericaAmerican owned, American operated. And the rocks will come from American quarries, and it will be loaded at American ports.
Steel for a vessel is being made by the United Steelworkers in Indiana. The engine will be made by the United States Electrical, Radio, and Machine Workers in Pittsburgh. The crew is going to be American marinemariners from Seafarers International Union.
The turbines themselves will be as tall as the buildings in Center City, Philadelphia. That's how big they are. And the blades: 110 yards long. I went to see them being made in Colorado. It's breathtaking. And I might add, notwithstanding what the other guy said, windmills do not cause cancer. [Laughter]
Look, some folks may not know there was a law in 1920 called the Jones Act that was passed. It says ships traveling between U.S. ports have to be American built, American owned, and have American crews. But there are some content to rely on ships built overseas without American crews to operate them. Again, not on my watch.
We're strengthening the American shipbuilding, supporting good union jobs, and bringing offshore wind supply chains back home. Before the pandemic, ""supply chain"" wasn't a phrase that most Americans ever thought about. But today, after delays in parts and products, everybody knows what a supply chain means and why they matter.
Our ""Investing in America"" agenda is bringing our clean energy supply chains home. Since I took office, we've seen more than $16 billion in new offshore wind investments, including 18 offshore wind vessels, 12 manufacturing facilities, and 13 ports.
Today we announced the first-ever offshore wind sale in the Gulf of Mexico. We're going to the Gulf. You think I'm kidding. [Laughter] Ain't seen nothing yet. Across the Delaware River in Paulsboro, New Jersey, workers are welding the steel foundation for another large-scale wind project. That's going to create more than 3,000 good-paying jobs.
A project off the coast of New York will use a vessel built in the shipyards of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Florida and rely on an electrical substations engineered in Kansas and made in Texas.
The Inflation Reduction Act offers tax credits for projects using American-made iron, steel, manufactured products so our clean energy future will be made in America. I mean it. And all this investmentyou know it better than any group of people I could be talking toall this investment means good-paying jobs here at homehere at home.
We're making sure these new jobs come free and fair and the ability to join a union if you're not already in a union. I made a commitment that I'd be the most prounion President in American history, and I'm keeping that promise.
Let me explain why. I met with the Business Roundtable, the leading businessmen in the Nation. And they asked me, ""Why?"" I said, ""Because it's good for you."" I tell businesses all the time: Union workers are the best in the world. You don't just say: ""By the way, I want to be an electrician. Here's my license.""
The young woman I justyou just heard, she's not an electrician, but guess what? Four to 5 years of apprenticeship. It's like going back to school. It's like going to college for 4 years. You do the job right. They do it on time. And long term, it costs less than nonunion labor.
And here at the Philly Shipyard, over a thousand union workers will be employed onsite like metalworkers, boilermakers, electricians. In fact, this shipyard runs an apprenticeship program giving workers the skills to do these jobs. They can earn up to $100,000 a year, and you don't need a college degree.
Just a few years ago, this shipyard was down to a handful of workersbecause these guys know I've been coming here for a long, long timesince 1973when it was the Navy Shipyard. And a lot of us wondered whether it would still be here, didn't we? A lot of us wondered 15, 10, 12 years ago. Well, let me tell you: It's coming alive again.
Just this week my administration completed a review for a potential wind project off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut. It's part of the national project labor agreement with the building trades. And I want to thank the AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler for personally getting that done.
Together, we're transforming the country not just through manufacturing, but also rebuilding our infrastructure. We need to have the best infrastructure in the world if we're going to lead the world. We used to be number one. We now rank number 13 in the world in highways, bridgeshow can we be number one in the world economically?
You can't have the best economy without having the best infrastructure. So the bipartisan infrastructure law, which a number of our colleagues did vote for on both sides of the aisleI've already announced 35,000 projects in 4,500 communities all across America, proving we can do big things.
By the way, right here, in Philly, we're going to build billion-dollar tunnels underneath the water as you go from Amtrak station heading north. It's going to increase the speeds of trains. They'll be able to go through it 100 miles an hour instead of 30.
And guess what? When you get to point A to point B and you can do it on rail and leave your car home, people leave their cars home. It saves money, saves the environment.
There's no better example than here in Philadelphia: A tanker truck crashed and closed a key stretch of I-95 last month. You remember that. A hundred and fifty thousand vehicles cross that part of the highwaya hundred and fifty thousandevery single day. With the leadership of Governor Shapiro, Casey, Fetterman, Boyle, Kenney, it opened in less than 2 weeks. Do you hear that? Two weeks. Congratulations, Mr. Mayor.
I mean, think about it. All kidding aside. When I waswe were saying that on thewhenon the bridge, people were looking at us like: ""Oh, God. Here they go again."" It's a record time. And guess what? It used materials from right here in Pennsylvaniaall that crushed glass, all that baseI meanand it was done with union work.
Also announced $78 million for safety improvements along Roosevelt Boulevard here in Philly, from North Broad to the Bucks County line. Between 2012 and 2021, accidents along that stretch of highway killed 119 people and I don't know how many injured. A hundred and nineteen died.
Nearly one in three Philadelphians lives within a mile of there, meaning thousands of families will benefit when we make that a hell of a lot safer.
Removing every single lead pipe in America, including an estimated 20,000 lead pipe lines here in Philadelphia and thousandsand thousands of lead pipes in school fountains all across America, including here in Philadelphia. They're a risk to everyone's health, especially our children.
We're making investments like this in communities all across the country, in red States, blue States. It doesn't matter; I'm President for everybody. And I said that no matter whether they voted for me or against me, I would make sure we changed this.
You can see exactly where this money is going if you're interested. Go toonline, go to invest.gov, and find out what's happening in your community, because that you know, we talked remember ""Infrastructure Week""? [Laughter] Well, we have ""Infrastructure Decade.""
And guess what? It's committed 1 trillion 300 billion dollars. And guess what else? I lowered the Federal deficit by 1 trillion 700 billion dollars in the first 2 years. You can do both.
You know, the reason I'm saying this is, we've operated on principles that aren'thaving been working.
My ""Invest in America"" agenda also had another transformative impact. All those Members of Congress who voted against the bill suddenly realized it's pretty good. And they're bragging about it. [Laughter] I found it interesting.
As you may have seenapparently 40 million people watchedMarjorie Taylor Greene, the very conservative gentlelady from the State of Georgia, said, ""Biden is doing things like Roosevelt,"" and it goes on the line as if it""creating these jobs, and he thinks that""I thought that wasI've never had an endorsement from her before. [Laughter]
But all kidding aside, every Republicanevery single Republicanvoted against the Inflation Reduction Act. And now many are trying to repeal. You know, and it wasin orderthe whole reason for the act was to repeal the clean energy provisions. That's why they voted ""no."" But it didn't stop them from claiming credit now that billions of dollars and thousands of jobs are coming to their States.
And then there's the distinguished Senator from Alabama, a former coach of a winning football team at University of Alabama: Senator Tubervilleyou know, the one who's blocking the nominations of America's finest military leaders, jeopardizing our national security over domestic social issues.
Well, he's also strongly opposed to the bipartisan infrastructure law. And nowI listened to him on television. He voted against it, and here's what he says now: ""Great to see Alabama receive critical funds to boost ongoing broadband efforts.""
I thought he thought it was a bad idea to invest in that. But now it's coming to Alabama, and hot damn, boy, it's a good thing. Look, I'm glad the Senator is coming around on the infrastructure law, but I'm not going to let up until he comes around on the critical military nominations as well.
Let me close with this. I'm not here to declare victory; we've got a long way to go on the economy. But I'm here to say we have more work to do. We have a plan that's turning things around pretty quickly. ""Bidenomics"" is just another way of saying ""Restore the American Dream."" Forty years of trickle-down economics in Democrat and Republican administrations limited the dream to those at the top.
But I believe every American willing to work hard should be able to get a job no matter where they livein the heartland, in a small town, in big citiesto raise their kids on a good paycheck and keep roofs overhead with awhere they grew up, be able to stay there.
My dad used to have an expression, and I swear to God, this was the expression, as kids growing up. He'd and this was how he'd say it. He'd say: ""Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay.'"" And he meant it.
He never got to go to college, but he meant it. He worked like hell. Jobs are about dignity. That's the American Dream. That's Bidenomics.
It's rooted in what always worked best for this country: investing in America, investing in Americans. Because when you invest in our people, you strengthen the middle class, we see stronger economic growth that benefits everybody. The rich still do very well, and they should be able to do well.
When I-95 shut down last month, nobody thought we'd have it back open in less than 2 weeks. But with American ingenuity, American workers, we proved everybody wrong. I don't know about you, but it filled me with pride about what we can do when we work together. And we worked together on that project.
The same will be true here in Philly Shipyard and with the clean energy future we're building all across America. It will be transformational.
And for thousands of families who rely on good jobs for their projectthese projects create, it means restoring a sense of pride, a sense of hope, a sense of dignity that got lost somewhere along the way.
For the longest time, we've been told to give up on manufacturing in America. How many times have you heard or read in the paper the last 25 years we can never lead the world in manufacturing again? Well, we are, and we will. We'll never believe that. I've never believed it, and I don't think most of you did.
This Nation used to lead the world in manufacturing. And we're going to do it again.
I know the people of this country. And I can say honestly: I have never been more optimistic about America's future than I am this very day. I swear to God. I've long said to other world leadersand I know almost every one of them personally, met themit's never been a good bet to bet against America. It's never, never, never.
We just have to remember who we are. We're the United States of America. And there is nothingnothing beyond our capacity if we work together.
So God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.
This is a new day. We're going tomore work to do. We're going to get it done.
Thank you.

Thank youthat bird, right there. Thatthat pigeon. [Laughter]
Folks, first of all, let me begin by thanking all our families. I think we underestimate sometimeshey, Tommy. How are you?
I think we underestimate sometimes how much pressure is put on the familyour kids, our grandkids, our spouses, our parents. And I want to thank you. And that's why this is really not for the Members of Congress; this is for all of their families. That's what this is all about. So thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
And, folks, look, I want toa special welcome to Speaker Emeritusand she'sshe's going to be my Speaker her whole life, I thinkmy whole life. And I want to thank Nancy and herand

2023-07-19 00:00:00,Remarks in a Meeting of the White House Competition Council,"
Please, stay seated. Stay seated. Thank you. Hello, everybody. Good afternoon.
The reason we're late: It's all my fault. I know that's a shock. But I must tell you, I couldn't resist. Two of thethe children of a man and a woman who got me started inback in 1972it was actually 1970were in town, and I showed them the office. And I apologize for keeping you waiting. I really am.
Look, this Competition Council is an important part of Bidenomics, my plan to build an economy from the middle out and the bottom up. And I think it's working. I think it's working.
For example, over the past year, we've seen a dramatic decline in inflation. It dropped by two-thirdsdown to 3 percentat a time when unemployment has been below 4 percent for the longest stretch in 50 years. I've rejected the notion that the reason for inflation isthe only way you get inflation down is reduce employment and/or reduce wages.
Remember, the experts said: To get inflation under control, we need to lower those wages and drive up unemployment. But I've never bought that. I don't think the problem in America today is too many people working or working people are making too much money.
Instead, we focused on getting America into the workforceAmericans into the workforce by fixing a broken supply chains and lowering costs. The fact is, companies made record-high profits during the pandemic. And now those costs are coming down and so is inflation. We need to keep bringing down the mark-ups and their margins and continue making progress on inflation.
And promoting competition helps lower cost as well.
Now, I've said this before: I'm a capitalist, but I have no problem with companies making reasonable profits. But it's got to be a fair competition for that to occur.
Before I took office, more than three-quarters of the American industries had become more concentrated than they arethan they were before. Often, just a handful of companies dominate the marketplace. Bidenomics is about increasing competition, not stifling competition. When companies have to compete, it means lower prices, fairer wages, and more innovation.
That's why, 2 years ago, I signed an Executive order to create this Council to increase competition and lower costs for American households.
For example, we made hearing aids available over the counter for as little as $200 a pair, instead of thousands of dollars, and capped the price of insulin at $35 onthose on Medicare, and thus saving folks hundreds of thousands of dollars over time.
You know, we aim to we're taking aim at noncompete clauses, which prevent 30 million Americansfrom security guards to retail workersfrom getting jobs in the same field. And there's no rationale for that. It's not like they have trade secrets.
And we're cracking down on junk fees across industries, including banking, concert, airlines, and junk health insurance plans. Folks are tired of being played for suckers. They're just tired of being played for suckers. And it's about basic fairness.
Today we're taking more action.
First, the Department of Agricultureand you'll hear from the Secretary in a momenttogether with bipartisan attorneys general in 31 States and the District of Columbia are ramping up enforcement of antitrust and consumer protection laws in food and in agriculture.
For example, just four supermarket companies control over a thirda thirdof the market nationwide. And it's even more concentrated at the local level, where consumers have beenhave had even fewer stores to choose from. Groceries in consolidated markets will charge you more because you have nowhere else to shop.
Now the Department of Agriculture and partners in the States are going to make large corporationsmaking sure they cannot artificially raise food prices through price fixing and price gouging.
Second, we're cracking down on hidden junk fees in rental housing. Folks at home know having to pay $100 or more just to fill out a rental application, even though the credit check can cost as little as $20. The application fees can be a profit center for landlords.
Some accept applications from hundreds of potential tenants, far more than they could seriously consider renting to, just to collect these fees. And then some charge surprise fees just to pay your rent online or fees for services that should be included in rent, like mail sorting and pest control. It's simply not right, and we're going to move on it.
Now several real estate companies serving tens of millions of renters, including Zillow, apartments.com, affordablehousing.comthey have joined us to take action against these junk fees. They're updating their websites to show renters all the hidden fees up front so you can know the full cost before they sign a lease.
Third, this morning, the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission released their new Merger Guidelines. Anticompetitive mergers can hurt people and drive up costs as well.
For example, hospital mergers have led to price increases of 20 percent or more. Health insurance mergers have caused premiums to go up 7 percent on average. All told, this kind of industry concentration costs the typical American household an estimated $5,000 a year.
And I've said when I signed the Executive order, we cannot accept bad mergers that lead to mass layoffs, higher prices, and fewer options for workers and consumers.
I'll close with this: To get this meeting started, I've said before: CapitalismI've said before, capitalism without competition isn't capitalism; it's exploitation. And I'm grateful to this Competition Council as we keep building on this momentum to reduce cost and deliver more results for the American people.
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Secretary Vilsack. Mr. Secretary.

2023-07-18 00:00:00,Remarks Prior to a Meeting With President Isaac Herzog of Israel and an Exchange With Reporters,"
President Biden. Well, Mr. President, welcome back. Welcome back to Washington. Welcome back to the White House, and it's a pleasure to have you.
And you know, we were together in Israel, and we're together again today. We've got a lot to talk about.
And Iyou know my love for Israel is deep rooted and long lasting. And as Ias I've often said: If there wasn't an Israel, we'd have to invent one. Andbut 75 years.
President Herzog. It's amazing.
President Biden. Seventy-five years. It's hard to believe. Hard to believe I even remember about two-thirds of those. [Laughter]
And this is a friendship, I believe, that's just simply unbreakable. Unbreakable. And together, working to bring more stability and integration in the Middle East. And a lot of hard work. We've got a lot more to do, but there's progress.
Last year, we convened the largest gathering of Arabs and Israelis in a decade at the Negev Forum. And we resolved the maritime boundary dispute between Israel and Lebanon, which people thought could never happen. We opened up an airspace for Israel inover Saudi Arabia and Oman after I had a little visit there. And we brought Israelis and Palestinians together at a political level on theinat thein Aqaba and El Sharm.
President Herzog. Yes.
President Biden. And as I affirmed to Prime Minister Netanyahu yesterday, America's commitment to Israel is firm, and it is ironclad. And we're committed, as well, to ensure that Iran never acquires a nuclear weapon.
So we've got a lot to talk about. But, again, welcome.
President Herzog. Thank you, Mr. President. It's wonderful to see you again.
I bring a message of greeting and gratitude on behalf of the people of Israel, the entire nation of Israel, from all sides of the political spectrum, all expressing great friendship and gratitude to you.
As you said, fromit's almost a jubilee[laughter]since you entered politics. And you've always stood by the State of Israel and the people of Israel in so many issues.
And I was pleased to hear about your conversation with Prime Minister Netanyahu, in which you focused on our ironclad military and security cooperation, because there are some enemies of ours that sometimes mistaken the fact that we may have some differences as impacting our unbreakable bond. And I truly believe that had they known how much our cooperation has grown in recent yearsand it's achieved new heightsthey would not think that way.
I also want to thank you, Mr. President, for pursuing more and more cooperation and integration in the region, for finding and looking for further partners for peace with Israel, and for cooperating on so many regional issues together.
And finally, Mr. President, I know you have mentioned, and youwe will discuss that as well, the internal Israeli situation.
As you know, I'm here, and I'm happy to be here because tomorrow I will be speaking in front of a Joint Session of Congress especially devoted to celebrating Israel's 75th independence. However, of course, my heart and soul is also in Israel in the heated debate which we are going through as a society. It's a heated debate, but it is also a virtue and a tribute to the greatness of Israeli democracy.
And let me reiterate clearcrystal clear: Israeli democracy is sound, strong, and resilient. We are going through pains. We are going through heated debates. We are going through challenging moments. But I true believetruly believeand I will say to you, Mr. President, as I've said it as head of state to the people of Israel: We should always seek to find amicable consensus. And I agree with you on that as well.
I'm pursuing it, even in these very moments, for my people, as much as we can, in order to find solutions and exit out of this crisis properly.
Thank you, Mr. President, for your friendship. And God bless you.
President Biden. Thank you for your friendship. And we've got a lot to talk about. Thank you all very much.
[At this point, several reporters began asking questions at once.]

2023-07-13 00:00:00,"Remarks Prior to a Meeting With President Sauli Niinist of Finland in Helsinki, Finland","
President Niinist. So, Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, it's a great pleasure to wish you welcome to Finland. And I continue by thanking you for your strong support and your strong will to support us during the time that Finland has entered to a new era in our security policy.
And I have to tell you that this week in Vilnius was very impressive to experience the way you created unity amongst the allies. That was great to see.
President Biden. Thank you.
President Niinist. So, once again, I warmly welcome you, and I guess you got the best welcomes already on the streets of Helsinki[laughter]which are[inaudible].
President Biden. By the way, they are. They're veryvery gracious. Very gracious.
Well, it's a delight to be here. It's good to be back in Finland. This is my second visit. And it'syou know, I remember a conversation you and I had when you called to come to the White House to talk about being a member
President Niinist. Yes.
President Biden. of NATO. And it took me about 3 seconds to say, ""Yes."" Strong support.
President Niinist. Yes. [Laughter]
President Biden. No, I mean it sincerely, because we hadwe launched your ratification processthe fastest it's occurred in modern history. The fastest ratification period occurring in modern history.
You may remember my telling you, I said to our friend in the east that he wants the Finlandization of NATO; well, you're going to get the NATO-ization of Finland. [Laughter]
But all kidding aside, you know, you'reyou've been a great partner. We're great allies. And you know, Finland and the United States, I think we're stronger together. And I really mean that. You've been an incredible asset to NATO and to the world.
Theand the main reason is, we have the same value set. I really mean that. It really matters. And you know, we're deepening our defense cooperation to ensure thatthe security of our people as we modernize theyour air force with the F-35 aircraft, which you already had.
And together, we're standing for shared democratic values. That's what it's all about. I really thinkand you're very gracious and kind to give me credit for unity at NATO. But I think it'sI've been doing this a long time; I don't think NATO has ever been stronger.
President Niinist. You could sense a feeling of that.
President Biden. No, I believe that.
President Niinist. Yes.
President Biden. And we had a very, veryI had a very good, long meeting with Zelenskyy, who ended up being very happy, and met with his military people.
And I think there's aIit's a different era in the nature of our relationship and bringing along Sweden as well. It makes a gigantic difference.
So I'm anxious to continue to work with you.
President Niinist. It seems that when things get serious, also people understand that we have to stick together.
President Biden. And you putting together this U.S.-Nordic Summit means a lot to me as well, so I'm looking forward to meeting our colleagues. But I want to thank you. I mean, you've been an incredible, incredible partner.
Q. Mr. President, is peace in Ukraine possible as long as Putin remains in power?
Q. Mr. President, did the Chinese hack any sensitive information breached in Secretary Raimondo's e-mails?

2023-07-13 00:00:00,"Remarks at the United States-Nordic Leaders Summit in Helsinki, Finland","
President Sauli Niinist of Finland. Mr. President, dear Joe, you're most welcome to this Nordic family meeting.
President Biden. Good to be back.
President Niinist. You know all of us, and we know you. We have understood and heard you referring many times on discussions soby you and President Obama, and saying that if the whole world would be like Nordics, we wouldn't have that many problems.
President Biden. That's almost exactly what he would say. ""If we left the important decisions to the Nordics, we'd all be in good shape.""
President Niinist. Oh, it's even better. [Laughter] Let'sthis afternoon we try to be the worthy of that, by your assistance.
I think we have on the table only one issue, that is guarantee the future: security-wise, environmental-wise, and technology-wise.
So why don't we get started, please.
President Biden. Well, friends, it's good to be here with all of you. It's good to be back in Finland and
[At this point, President Biden adjusted his microphone.]
There you go. It's good to be back in Finland and with all of you. And Barack wasn't very far off.
And we just finished a historic NATO summitand I think it was historicwhere we welcomed Finland's accession to NATO and reached an agreement to move forward on Sweden's membership in NATO. And it was a reminder that the nations around the table arenot only share a common history, but we share common challenges andI would add, presumptuouslycommon values.
And you know, the vision for the world that we all shareand I think it's a very similar visionis one that's more free, more secure, and opportunities made available for all. Because we know that when other countries do well, particularly those countries who are struggling, we all do better. We all do better.
And we're working in lockstep onto tackle climate crisis, which you've been leaders on for a long time, andin order to literally preserve our planet. It's the only existential threat humanity faces, and we don't have a lot of time. But I'm confident if we continue to work together, we can deal with it.
And we're pioneering the next generation of technologies, and that's going to power everyone's economies. And I think we have to evenwe have to continue to remain very close on coordinating. Because it can be a great, great advantage for humanity, but it could also cause some great difficulties in artificial intelligence and other things if we don't cooperate and know what is going on.
And together, we're standing with the brave people of Ukraine as they defend themselves against Russia's brutal assault.
So today I look forward to discussing these and many other issues. And generally, it's an honor to be with you all. It's an honor to be with you. Thank you.
Prime Minister Katrin Jakobsdttir of Iceland. Well, thank you, Sauli, for organizing this meeting. And thank you, Joe, for being with us, your Nordic friends, here today.
I think it's actually very meaningful for all of us just arriving from Vilnius, the NATO summit. And we can continue our discussions on security, but also talk about the other generational challenges we are all facingthe climate and the biodiversity crisis, if I may mention that.
President Biden. Yes.
Prime Minister Jakobsdttir. And I must say that the U.S. obviously has a very important role to play there. And we definitely want to do our bit there.
Artificial intelligenceand I agreeit is really the responsibility of our societies to ensure that it will benefit all of us because it can also have a detrimental effect. And I would also like to mention societal resilience, which is a theme we often talk about here at our Nordic meetings, and I think we can actually, well, you know, learn a lot from each other when it comes to those issues.
So I value this opportunity very much and look forward to our discussions.
Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen of Denmark. Well, first of all, thank you forfor hosting us today, and good to see you in the Nordic part of the world, President Biden. I think wasour meeting in NATO in Vilnius was very successful. It's a stronger alliance now after we left the meeting than before.
And I think we have to salute you, because it was a brave decision, just after the war started, to gather with Sweden to walk in our direction in NATO. And now you have become a member, and we are so happy that we will soon be able to welcome Sweden as well.
And of course, this means something for the Nordic region, because we have been together in so many areas through the years, but we have never been together in NATO before. So this also brings us some possibilities and opportunities in the Nordic region.
You said before that we have been frontrunners on the green transition, but it's you who have brought U.S. back on the green agenda, fighting climate change.
And I think one of the areas where we can work even closer together, U.S. and the Nordic, are the idea of not only ensuring that we will combat climate change, but at the same time, we have to create jobs for ordinary people.
President Biden. Yes.
Prime Minister Frederiksen. Soand this is the Nordic way of doing things, that we always think holistic. So not just solving a crisis or solving a problem, but creating a better future for more people.
And with you as President in the White House, we have a possibility to do it together.
So thanks again for inviting us. It's fantastic to be here.
Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stre of Norway. I will follow up on my colleagues and for you, President Biden, to be with the Nordics, as we said in Vilnius, this is the first time in modern times. Historians will discuss whether you have to go back to the 14th century to see us around the same table. [Laughter]
Prime Minister Frederiksen. [Inaudible]
Prime Minister Stre. Wellwe've
Prime Minister Frederiksen. And we decided that.
Prime Minister Stre. Yes. [Laughter] We were very young then.
But nonetheless, it is historic. And I don't think this is a time for looking back; it's really time to see what will this mean. I think it will be a stronger Nordic voice in NATO. It will make us more secure and NATO stronger, as a strong alliance.
And I'll pick up on what Mette is saying. I remember, President Biden, in the campaign, you said that ""I'm a union man."" And I think when we do work on the environment and the big energy transition, we really have to look after jobs and welfare. Because if this is going to be a detriment for jobs and welfare, we will not succeed.
And I take it that we are likeminded on this. And we have to be preparing for climate conferences this fall, for new moments coming. And I think this discussion here will also give us some inspiration for that.
In addition, when we will now start planning our security and national defense, we will do so for the first time with what we call interoperability in the northern region. And that is a significant improvement.
Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson of Sweden. First, Sauli, thanks very much for hosting us again in this beautiful place. The last time was together with President Zelenskyy. Thank you so much.
And, Mr. President, thanks for joining us and
President Biden. [Inaudible]
Prime Minister Kristersson. [Laughter] Thanks for joining us anyway. And thanks for all your help and all your support in our NATO accession. I do appreciate it very, very much.
We met with you, President, inI met you in the White House last week. And we met, all of us, in the NATO summit yesterday. And now we meet in Helsinki. So, recently, I have met you more than I met my own family, actually. [Laughter] I like it a lot. [Laughter]
And I think there is a great potential for even closer U.S.-Nordic cooperation in all these fields of security, of green transition. I think basically a stronger transatlantic link in our time's big challengesnot least in relation to China, for examplethat is an answer to many questions.
So I really hope these are a few of the topics we will be able to discuss here today. Thanks.

Moderator. Thank you. Please be seated.
Welcome to this joint press conference by President of the Republic of Finland, Sauli Niinist, and President of the United States, Joe Biden.
We will begin with statements by the presidents.
President Niinist. Thank you, and good afternoon.
Excellent that we have this kind of a big hall in the castle. Plenty of you here.
First of all, Joe, Mr. President, I want to thank you for visiting Finland. We have had possibilities of meeting each other quite often during the
President Biden. And I like it here even better. [Laughter]
President Niinist. Yes. [Laughter] And by the way, first time we met, also in Helsinki, I was the Speaker of Parliament when you visited.
President Biden. I remember.
President Niinist. So we have had a lot of discussions during the last couple years. I want to, once again, thank you for the strong support you have given all the time.
President Biden. It's my honor.
President Niinist. The new era in Finnish security policy has begun, and you will be one of those who brought it to history.
I also want to thank you for the Vilnius meeting. It was very touching to feel the unity between allies. And I think it was greatly created by you.
We had possibilities of discussing bilaterally today. I took up the negotiations of our defense cooperation agreement. We are going to continue our security discussion bilat, and that is of vital importance to Finland.
In the same time, also, Sweden and Denmark are having similar discussions. And at the end, it seems that all the five Nordic countries will have a bilateral agreement with U.S.A.
Technology is one of the key words for the future. There are elements like artificial intelligence, quantum technology, sky technology. All that is leading our way to the future. And we have to make sure that it's leading our way in a very secure way. And that demands responsibility of those who know how. And that is why it is very important to coordinate and cooperate with our knowledge and resources forward in this sector.
We also had a discussion on our neighbor, and I think that we both share similar views. The war in Ukraine was also discussed. We both see that we will continue support to Ukraine, which is defending not only herself, but also all the values we represent in the western world.
We also had a meeting with the Nordic family. It is a tradition, which started during President Obama's time, and it has been a very valuable tool for us to geteven better understand each other's security and technology. They're also discussed there. And a lot of time and thoughts were presented on environmental issues.
So, once again, it has been great to have you here.
President Biden. Well, thank you, Mr. President. It's been great to be here.
Look, it's an honor to be with you and our other Nordic friends. We just finished, I would suggest, a very productive U.S.-Nordic leaders summit on the heels of the historic NATO summit in Vilnius andwhere Finland took its place at the table as anas our newest ally. We've always been friends, but our newest official ally member of NATO.
And I also want to thank Minister Kristersson of Sweden, who will soon be joining NATO, and Prime Minister Stre of Norway. Shewe've had a great relationship. And Frederiksen of Denmark, and the Minister Jakoblindttir [Jakobsdttir; White House correction] of Irelandor""daughter of Ireland."" You can tell that's a Freudian slip; I'm thinking of home. The daughter of Iceland.
And I want to say I think we've had a very productive summit. We discussed, Mr. President, where we stand at an inflection point in history where the decisions we make now are going to determine the course of the history for the next four or five, six decades.
And this week, we affirmed how Finland and the United States, togethertogether with allies and partnersare working in lockstep to set us on a stronger, safer, and more secure path, not just for Europe, not just for NATO, but for the world.
In Vilnius, NATO met with 33 nations for the first31 nations for the first time. We showed the world our alliance is more united than ever. And soon, it will be 32 allies, thanks to an agreement with Turkey to move Sweden's accession protocols forward.
And as capable partners and committed democracies, both Finland and Sweden are going to add significantly to the strength, security, and unanimity of NATO. And a stronger NATO makes the entire world stronger.
Mr. President, as your ally, we want the people of Finland to know the United States is committed to Finland, committed to NATO, and those commitments are rock solid; that we will defend every inch of NATO territory, and that includes Finland, obviously.
Second, over the past week, we reaffirmed our unwavering support for the brave people of Ukraine as they defend their country against Russia's brutal and inhumane attacks.
Our allies and partners around the world understand that this fight is not only a fight for the future of Ukraine; it's about sovereignty, security, and freedom itself.
I want you to think about what would happen if we didn't do anything, what is likely to happen in the rest of Europe if we did nothing.
So, this week, NATO has officially elevated our relationship with Ukraine. Allies also agreed to lift the membership action plan that's usually required before you can be admitted andfrom Ukraine. And it's created a path for membership for Ukraine as it continues to make progress on the necessary democratic and security reforms required of every NATO member.
We also made clear to President Zelenskyy that we're not waiting for NATO membership to be finalized to commit to the long-term security of Ukraine. The leaders of the G-7 together issued a new Joint Declaration of Support for Ukraine, a declaration I was glad to see the Nordic nations immediately welcomed and supported.
It's going to launch a process, open to any nation, to negotiate bilateral security agreements withUkraine until they're officially members of NATO. It will not only ensure that Ukraine can defend itself today, but it will deter future aggression as well, with a capable force across land, air, and sea from their friends.
And finally, at every stop ofin every summit on this trip, we focused on using the power of partnership to take on the challenges that matter most to the people's lives in our countries.
In the United Kingdom, we brought together public, private, and philanthropic partners to discuss ways to unlock literally trillions of private dollars in finance to fight climate change.
In Lithuania, NATO allies met, and the EU and our Indo-Pacific partners, to continue advancing our work on terrorism, cyber threats, resilience, and so much more.
And here in Finland, at our U.S.-Nordic leaders summit, we reaffirmed our commitment to stand together, powerto power a clean energy transition; to preserve regional security; to promote democratic values; and to pioneer the technologies of the future, from quantum computing to advanced communications systems. So we did it together.
Mr. President, at this critical moment in history, this inflection point, the world is watching to see: Will we do the hard work that matters to forge a better future? Will we stand together? Will we stand with one another? Will we stay committed to our course?
This week, Finland and the United States and our allies and partners said a resounding, loud ""yes."" Yes, we'll step up. Yes, we'll stand together. And yes, we'll keep working toward a stronger, safer, and more secure world.
So, Mr. President, thank you again for having me here. As partners, friends, and allies, I look forward to our work together in the years ahead. And it's been a real pleasure getting to know you even better.
Thank you.
Moderator. Thank you. Now we have time for questions.
President Niinist. Shall we start with YLE, Iida Tikka? You.
North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
Q. Iida Tikka, Finnish Public Broadcasting Service. My question is for Mr. President Biden. The political volatility of U.S. remains a big worry for European partners. Meanwhile, back in Washington, a bipartisan group of Senators has repeatedly failed to pass through Senate a bill that would prevent the U.S. Presidents in the future from withdrawing from NATO without Senate's approval. What actions
President Biden. Sorry, what, I'm sorry? I didn't hear the last part of your question.
Q. In Washington, a bipartisan group of Senators has repeatedly failed to pass through Senate a law that would prevent future U.S. Presidents from withdrawing from NATO without Senate's approval. What actions will you take to assure Finland that the U.S. will remain a reliable NATO partner for decades to come?
President Biden. I absolutely guarantee it. There is no question. There's overwhelming support from the American people. There's overwhelming support from the Members of the Congress, both House and Senate. In both parties, notwithstanding the fact there are some extreme elements of one party, we will stand together.
The American people have known for thesince the end of World War II and the formation of NATO that our security rests in the unanimity among European and transatlantic partnerus. And so this isyou know, no one can guarantee the future, but this is the best bet anyone could make.
Q. And my second question, on that note, to Mr. President Niinist. Hearing this answer that no one can guarantee a future, are you worried that the political instability in U.S. will cause issues in the alliance in the future?
President Biden. Let me be clear: I didn't say we didn't guaranteewe couldn't guarantee the future. You can't tell me whether you're going to be able to go home tonight. No one can be sure what they're going to do.
I'm saying, as sure as anything can possibly be said about American foreign policy, we will stay connected to NATOconnected to NATO, beginning, middle, and end. We're a transatlantic partnership. That's what I've said.
President Niinist. It seems that the President has answered your problems. [Laughter]
But I have to tell you that during this process, I met approximatelyPresident many timesbut I would say about 50 people from Congress and Senate. And I think the message was quite clear, quite united. And I have no reason to doubt about U.S.A. policies in the future.
President Biden. Let me say one more thing. We learned a hard lesson. Peace and security in Europe is essential to U.S. security and peace. The idea that there could be conflict in Europe among our friends and us not engaged has never happened in modern history. That's why we're staying together.
Moderator. Next question, President Biden.
President Biden. Oh, I have to call on somebody. I'm sorry.
Wall Street Journal. Andrew [Andrew Restuccia].
North Atlantic Treaty Organization/Ukraine/Russia 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You've said that Ukraine shouldn't enter NATO until after the war is over. Are you concerned at all that those comments could motivate Putin to keep the war going or discourage him from entering peace negotiations?
And is there a serious risk that this war could drag on for years? And do you see any path toward the war ending with Putin still in power?
President Biden. First of all, no one can join NATO while the wara war is going on, where a NATO nation is being attacked, because that guarantees that we're in a war and we're in a third world war. So that is not about whether or not they should or shouldn't join. It's about when they can join. And they will join NATO.
The issue of whether or not this is going to keep Putin from continuing to fight, the answer is: Putin has already lost the war. Putin has a real problem. How does he move from here? What does he do? And so the idea that there's going to bewhat vehicle is used, he could end the war tomorrow; he could just say, ""I'm out.""
But what agreement is ultimately reached depends upon Putin and what he decides to do. But there is no possibility of him winning the war in Ukraine. He's already lost that war. Imagine ifeven ifanyway. He's already lost that war.
Q. And just on the question of a concern about it going on for years: Is there a possibility that there's a stalemate and this becomes
President Biden. I'm sorry?
Ukraine/Russia 
Q. The question of whether the war could go on for years. Is there a possibility there's a stalemate and it can continue for quite some time?
President Biden. Well, I don't think the war can go on for years for two reasons. Number one, I don't think that theythat Russia could maintain the war forevernumber onein terms of their resources and capacity.
Number two, I think that there is going to be a circumstance where, eventually, President Putin is going to decide it's not in the interest of Russiaeconomically, politically, or otherwiseto continue this war. But I can't predict exactly how that happens.
My hope is, and my expectation is, you'll see that Ukraine makes significant progress on their offensive and that it generates a negotiated settlement somewhere along the line.
U.S. Citizens Detained Abroad 
Q. And I have a question for the Finnish President. But I would be remiss if I didn't raise my colleague, Evan Gershkovich, who's been in prison for more than a hundred days. I just wondered if you had an update on the process for trying to get him out of prison and if you're serious about a prisoner exchange.
President Biden. Oh, I'm serious about a prisoner exchange. I'm serious about doing all we can to free Americans who are being illegally held in Russia or anywhere else for that matter. And that process is underway.
Q. And for the Finnish Prime Minister [President; White House correction], do you envision the possibility of the U.S. having a permanent military base in Finland?
President Niinist. Like I told, we are discussing on DCA, the defense cooperation agreement, and it has a lot of elements. They are still open. But we are open on negotiations, and I know that our counterpart is also very open. So let us see.
Moderator. Next question goes to President Niinist. Please.
President Niinist. Yes, it's Helsingin Sanomat, Elina Vntnen.
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. And my question is for Mr. President Biden. [Laughter]
President Biden. Okay.
Finland's Accession to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
Q. Or should I just say President Biden? [Laughter] You have repeatedly talked about Finlandization becoming NATOization of Finland. Now, based on your
President Biden. Sorry, Iwhat nation?
Q. You have repeatedly talked about Finlandization
President Biden. Oh, I see.
Q. becoming NATOization of Finland. Based on your long experience, how does that change Finland's place in the world?
President Biden. Well, first of all, the context in which I said that was: The gentleman who occupies a seat on the other side of theyour border, in Moscow, said he wantedI said he wanted the Findalization [Finlandization; White House correction] of NATO. I said it was more likely he's going to get the NATOization of Finland. [Laughter] That's whatthat's the context in which that was said.
And what was the second part of your question?
Q. I asked: How has Finland's position in the world changed during this
President Biden. Look
Q. NATO membership process?
President Biden. Finland is already a strong, vibrant nation. I think what Finland's joining NATO doesand with Sweden as wellwhen the Nordic countries are all members of NATO: It just makes the world safer. It significantly increases the prospect that there is less likely to be war.
We'llwe're deadly earnest about the notion. We'll defend every single inch of NATO territory. And now we're going towe're on the way of getting to 32 NATO nations. That's a significant commitment. And so the likelihood of any nation voluntarily deciding they're going to attack one of the nations or Finland is highly unlikely.
And sobut if it were to, they understand they're not just attacking Finland; they're attacking 31 other countries.
Moderator. Next question, President Biden, please.
President Biden. Oh, I'm sorry. I guess it's Arlette [Arlette Saenz] from CNN.
Russia/Nuclear Weapons/Wagner Group Mercenary Organization Leader Yevgeniy Viktorovich Prigozhin of Russia 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. We've seen more disarray with Russian generals, most recently with the firing of a general who criticized the Defense Ministry. This following that rebellion by Prigozhin. Does this raise any new concerns about Putin potentially doing more drastic things regarding Ukraine, like nuclear weapons, or potentially against the U.S., like election interference?
President Biden. Well, first of all, they already interfered in American elections. So that would not be anything new. They did that last timethey tried to.
But with regard toI don't think there's any real prospectyou never knowbut of Putin using nuclear weapons. Not only has the West, but China and the rest of the world has said: ""That'sdon't go there. Don't go there."" Number two.
Number three, I think that determining what happens to Prigozhin and what happens to VilniusI meanexcuse me, what happens when we discussed this in Vilnius is, God only knows what he's likely to do. Well, I'm not even surewe're not even sure where he is and what relationship he has. If I were he, I'd be careful what I ate. I'd be keeping my eye on my menu.
But all kidding aside, I who knows? I don't know. I don't think any of us know for sure what the future of Prigozhin is in Russia. And so I don't know how to answer that question beyond that.
Senator Thomas H. Tuberville/U.S. Military Promotions 
Q. And if I could also ask you something abouthappening back home. You're seeing the GOP grappling with tying abortion rights to defense issues, including a block on military promotions by Senator Tuberville. What does this say about U.S. military readiness? And would you be willing to talk with Tuberville to try to work out some solution?
President Biden. I'd be willing to talk to him if I thought there was any possibility of him changing this ridiculous position he has. He's jeopardizing U.S. security by what he's doing.
I expect the Republican Party to stand upstand upand do something about it. Theyit's within their power to do that.
The idea that we don't have a Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; the idea that we have all theseall these promotions that are in abeyance right now and we don't know what's going to happen; the idea that we're injecting into fundamental foreign policy decisions what, in fact, is a domestic social debate on social issues is bizarre.
I don't ever recall that happening, ever. And it's just totally irresponsible, in my view.
And I just think thatI mean, I'm confident that the mainstream Republican Party no longerdoes not support what he's doing. But they've got to stand up and be counted. That's how it ends.
Q. And for President Niinist, you've been working on fortifying the fence along the border between Finland and Russia. Is there anything that you're seeing recently that concerns you? And also, as a leader who shares a border with Russia, what more do you want to see done to deter Putin?
President Niinist. During the beginning of our application process, surely, we had to make sure, first, trying to figure out every possible negative action we might meet and, surely, how we response from that. And we were very careful on that work.
So, at the moment, the situation is quite calm. Hope it remains as such.
But I just want to tell you that Finnish people do feel more secure. At the moment, we have 80 percent of our population supporting NATO membership and more than 80 percent who say that we will also protect our allies. That's the Finnish position.
Moderator. Thank you. This concludes the press conference.
President Biden. Thank you very much.
Q. Do have a response to[inaudible]?
Q. Mr. President, are you satisfied with[inaudible]?

2023-07-12 00:00:00,"Remarks With Prime Minister Fumio Kishida of Japan and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine on the Group of Seven (G-7) Nations Joint Declaration of Support for Ukraine in Vilnius, Lithuania","
Prime Minister Kishida. I am pleased to be able to announce the Joint Declaration on Support for Ukraine today.
At the G-7 Hiroshima summit, by engaging in discussions that included a wide range of invited countries, we agreed that unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force or coercion are unacceptable anywhere in the world and to safeguard a free and open international order based on the rule of law.
I feel that it is truly meaningful that we, the G-7 leaders, and Volodymyr have gathered once again today. Going forward, this declaration will be open to any country that shares the intention to support Ukraine. I hope many countries will choose to join. The G-7 will continue to stand by Ukraine. Our solidarity will never waver.
Thank you very much.
President Biden. Let me start off by saying something that I hadn't planned on saying. You know, I think there are very few people in Europe or in the continental United States, in the North American continent, that thought this man would stand up and come to the aid and assistance of Ukraine. He increased his military budget. He stepped upJapanJapanbecause he understood that when any part of the world has 185,000 people, soldiers crossing a border, stealing sovereignty from another nation, that it affects the whole world.
I want to thank you again publicly.
We've just concluded the first meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Council andwhere all our allies agreed Ukraine's future lies in NATO. That's not a surprise to any of us, I don't think. I hope it's not a surprise to you, Mr. President.
Allies all agreed to lift the requirements for Membership Action Plan for Ukraine and to create a path to NATO membership while Ukraine continues to make progress on necessary reforms.
But we're not waiting for that process to be finished to make the long-term commitments that we're making to Ukraine's security. Volodymyr and I, wetheI shouldn't be so familiarMr. Zelenskyy and I talked about the kind of guarantees we could make in the meantime when I was in Ukraine and when we met in other places.
And so today the long-term commitments we're making are backed up by the notion that in the meantime we're going to provide security to Ukraine for its needs and against any aggression that may occur.
Today the members of the G-7 are launching a Joint Declaration of Support for Ukraine to make it clear that our support will last long into the future. This starts a process by which each of our nations and any other nation who wishes to participate will negotiate long-term bilateral security commitments with and to Ukraine.
We're going to help Ukraine build a strong, capable defense across land, air, and sea from which we will force theit will be a force of stability in the region and deter against any and all threats.
I want to thank my fellow G-7 leaders and President Zelenskyy for their work to make this happen. I think it's a powerful statementa powerful statementof our commitment to Ukraine as it defends its freedom today and as it rebuilds the future forand we're going to be there as long as that takes.
And, again, I thank all my colleagues for their support for this.
President Zelenskyy. Thank you very much, Mr. President.
President Biden; Prime Minister Kishida; ChancellorI don't seeI see youChancellor Scholz; Prime Minister Sunak; President Macron; Prime Minister Trudeau; Prime Minister Meloni; President Michel; President von der Leyen: A great honor to be here.
The outcome of the NATO summit in Vilnius is very much needed and meaningful success for Ukraine. And I am grateful to all leaders in NATO countries for very practical and unprecedented support considering decades of our relations' support for Ukraine.
Today, there are security guarantees for Ukraine on the way to NATO, an important package of security guarantees. Today, we are coordinating with the G-7 countries the framework for security guarantee that shall be further extended through arrangements with our key partners, bilateral and multilateral agreements.
And Ukrainian delegation is bringing home significant security victory for the Ukraine, for our country, for our people, for our children. It opens for us absolutely new security opportunities, and I thank everyone who made it possible. Thank you, dear colleagues. Thanks, youthanks, Lithuanian, and Jens Stoltenberg. Thank you very much.
Slava Ukraini.

2023-07-12 00:00:00,"Remarks Prior to a Meeting With President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine and an Exchange With Reporters in Vilnius, Lithuania","
President Biden. Well, Mr. President, welcome. And I hope you all got a sense today from all of my colleagues thathow much that you havehow much support you have. It's real. And I hope we finally have put to bed the notion about whether or not Ukraine is welcome in NATO. It's going to happen. We're movingyou're all moving in the right direction. And I think it's just a matter of getting by the next few months here.
So thank you, thank you, thank you.
And you know, it's hard to believe: 500 days. It's easy for me just mostlyI've been in and out of Ukraine a lot before the war, and some since the war. But I'm going to say again what I've said to you many times, not only all of you, but your peopleyour sons, your daughters, your husbands, your wives, your friends: You're incredible.
Ukrainethe whole world has seen the courageI reallyI mean this from the bottom of my heartthe courage and commitment of the average Ukrainian. When you see a 65-year-old woman on television after her apartment's been bombed out, picking up the pieces and going to help the next-door neighborI mean, it's just astounding. You've set an example for the whole world of what constitutes genuine courage in myI meanfrom the bottom of my heart, I mean thatwhat courage means. And you know, I think it'syour resilience and your resolve has been a model for the whole world to see.
And the frustration, I can only imagine. I know you're many times frustrated about when thingswhat things get to you quickly enough and what's getting to you and how we're getting there. But I promise you, the United States is doing everything we can to get you what you need as rapidly as we can get it to you.
And the Secretary of Defense has been a constant, constanthow can I say it?the refrainfrom the Defense Department and everywhere else toand calling other Secretaries of Defense around the world to say, ""Let's get some help.""
So I just want you to know it's real. And you know, here in Vilnius, we held the first, as you well know, NATO-Ukraine Council. But you and I talked about this beforehand, about the commitmentsthe security commitments we were going to make while it becomes officialuntil it becomes official. And I think that's important.
And I mightI want to tell you: When I got here, Mr. President, and I started to sell that idea to other heads of state, there was no reluctance. There was nono ""Well, I don't want to""[inaudible]it waseverybody just said: ""Okay. Let's sign on."" So it's real.
You've done an enormous job. You have a lot more to do, I know. And I just think that, you know, we're going to make sure that you get what you need. And I look forward to the day when we're having the meeting celebrating your officialofficialmembership in NATO.
So thank you for what you're doing. And the bad news for you is, we're not going anywhere. [Laughter] You're stuck with us.
So thank you.
President Zelenskyy. Thank you very much, Mr. President. And I will start.
You said about 500 days. It's really, really a difficult job for our peoplesoldiers and civilians, mothers, fathers, and childrenreally, to fight for their lifefor their life and for these values.
And thank you very much that all these days you are with us. I mean, you and Americans, all of AmericaAmericans and Congress. I mean, thank you, Mr. President, that youlike we say, shoulder to shoulder with us from first days of full-scale war. We appreciate for this very much.
And reallyreally, you know, we understand you're leading support, because when you give such messages and when you gave sometimes some weaponI'm sorry that I'mbut I want to say to journalists, like I said during our meeting, our council, that it's very simple, you know, to criticize, for example, clusters munition, which you made decisiondifficult political decision. But it'sbut you have to know that Russia used such weapon from the first days, not only full-scale warfrom first days of occupation of Crimea, from 2014 and '15, in all our territories. In Donbas, they used it. And now they continue doing. And that you gave usthis decision will help us to save us.
And that's why my appreciation for theand I didn't hear from all the, you know, parts of the world when Russia began to use itI didn't hear that some of, you know, countries criticized Russia. You know? But I think that it was very useful to put them.
So thank you so much for this help. We really counted on itnot only on this. I mean thistotally. And you gave us huge support.
I want to thank to all Americans. We understand that it's more than 43 billions for today. It's big support. And I understand that it's all your money, but you have to know that you spend this money fornot just for fighting; you spend this money for our lives. And theI think that we save the lives for Europe and for all the world.
So thank you very much for this also summit. At the end of the summit, we hadI think this council had great success and security guarantees, as you said, that we began to speak itabout it in Kyiv.
So now we see that we hadyou had great idea, that G-7and now I know thatlast message isthat also there are countries which joined to G-7 decisions, and I think it will help very much because itit's real effect thatit's very[inaudible]phase.
So thank you.
President Biden. Well, thank you. And thank you for acknowledging the American people. I think it's correct that we are a large country, but I think we've given more than every other nation combined in terms of assistance and cost.
And the American people are supportivethey're supportivebecause they know it's about you, but it's about more than you. It's about innocent people around the world and the absolute brutality with which Putin is acting and the Russians are moving on. It's justit's just somelike something out of the 14th century the way they're acting.
And sobut I can't emphasize enough.
And by the way, I know you thanked him, but I think we talked about it before. I went to Tokyo yearsmorea couple years ago. The idea that Kishida is increasing their defense budget, having to lower their domestic budget, to aid directly and get directly involved in what's happening in Ukraine is remarkable.
The sad, sad news is, you're in this situation. The incredible news is, it's bringing the world together. It's bringing the world together in a way thatit's a hell of a price to pay, but it's bringing the world together. And people are realizing that they just can't stand by and let this kind of aggression occur.
Any rate, I thank you, and we've got a lot to talk about. So somebody is going to have to say, ""The press has to leave."" [Laughter]
Q. President Zelenskyy, are you satisfied with what you got from NATO? You were so frustrated yesterday. Is this enough? Are you satisfied, sir?
President Zelenskyy. I think, at the end of summit, we have great unity from our leaders and security guarantees, that the success for this summit. I think so, but it's my opinion. Thank you.
Q. Thank you, sir.
Ukraine/North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
Q. President Zelenskyy, how soon after the war would you like to be in NATO? How soon after the war would you like to join NATO?

2023-07-12 00:00:00,"Remarks in Vilnius, Lithuania","
The President. Hello, Lithuania! As my mother would say, ""God love you."" No seats. Holy mackerel. [Laughter]
It's good to be back in Vilnius, a nation and a region that knows better than anyone the transformational power of freedom. You know, you showed the world that the strength of a people united cannot be denied.
And together, with your brothers and sisters in Estonia and Latvia, you helped end the era of division through the power of connection. The Baltic Way, not the Berlin Wall, became the symbol for Europe's future.
And later, when Soviet tanks sought once more to deny your independence, the people of Vilnius said, ""No."" No, no, no. And in January of 1991, tens of thousands of citizens, unarmed and unyielding, came for their ownof their own accord, standing as one to protect the TV Tower, to shield the Supreme Council, and defend freedom.
Fourteen heroes tragically lost their lives. Hundreds were wounded. But the whole world saw that decades of oppression had done nothing to dim the flame of liberty in this country. I mean it. It's consequential.
The light of Lithuania: You kept it strong. You kept it bright. And you kept the light shining here in Vilnius and in Washington, DC, where the yellow, green, and red of your flag flew every day.
This past year, we've celebrated a hundred years of unbroken diplomatic relationship between the United States and the Baltic States. AmericaAmericanever recognized the Soviet occupation of the Baltics. Never, never, never, Mr. President.
And besides, you've got a great President. [Applause] Stand up. No, stand up. As your President can tell you, the bonds between Lithuanian and the American people have never faltered.
And just 7 months after the bloody January crackdown, the first foreign visitor to have their passports stamped here in Lithuania with visas of thisto this new, reborn state were a planeload of Lithuanian Americans from Chicago, Illinois. [Applause] Oh. [Laughter] And their families are still proud of that.
Audience member. From Los Angeles.
The President. Los Angeles came after that. [Laughter] A lot came after.
Look, many aboard that plane had fled Lithuania during the early years of Soviet oppression and marveledmarveledat their return to this independent state. One of them told reporters, quote, ""This day is like a resurrection for us."" ""This day, Father, is like a resurrection for us."" That's what the quote was, for real. That's the feeling.
And it was: a resurrection that quickly became a revelation. And a nation which stands today as a stronghold of liberty and opportunity, a proud member of the European Union and of NATO.
I had the great honor as a United States Senator of championing Lithuania and other Baltic States to join NATO in 2004. Wasn't I brilliant doing that? [Laughter] But, all kidding aside, think about what ithow it's changed things. Think about what's happened.
Now, over the last few days, as President of the United States, I had the honor of participating in a historic NATO summit hosted by Lithuania, where we welcomed NATO's newest ally, Finland, and reached agreement to bring Sweden into the alliance as soon as possible. And President Erdogan kept his word.
We've witnessed your historic journey. And I'm proud to call Lithuania friend, partner, and ally. Ally. Ally.
Soon, NATO will be the 32d freestandinghave free30 free32 freestanding members[laughter]standing together to defend our people and our territory, beyondbeyond all the rest, bound by democratic values to make us strong and by our sacred oath that an attack againstit is a sacred oathattack against one is an attack against all. Because each member of NATO knows that the strength of our people and the power of our unity cannot be denied.
If I sound optimistic, it's because I am. Today, our alliance remains a bulwark of global security and stability as it's been for more than seven decades. NATO is stronger, more energized, and, yes, more united than ever in its history. Indeed, more vital to our shared future.
It didn't happen by accident. It wasn't inevitable.
When Putin, and his craven lust for land and power, unleashed his brutal war on Ukraine, he was betting NATO would break apart. He was betting NATO would break. He thought our unity would shatter at the first testing. He thought democratic leaders would be weak. But he thought wrong.
Faced with a threat[applause]. Faced with a threat to the peace and stability of the world, to democratic values we hold dear, to freedom itself, we did what we always do: The United States stepped up. NATO stepped up. Our partners in Europe, in theand then the Indo-Pacific stepped up. All across the world they stepped up.
And we're readywe were ready because we stood together.
In the months leading up to the war, as Putin amassed his forces on the Ukrainian border and laid the groundwork for his brutal invasion, it wasI was in constant contact with my fellow leaders of the G-7 and the European Union and NATO, constantly.
We warned the world what Putin was planning. Even some in Ukraine didn't believe we werewhat we hadour intelligence community found. We made sure NATO was prepared to deter any aggression against any member state. We pursued intense diplomacy with Russia, seeking to avert this terrible war. And when Russian bombs began to fall, we did not hesitate to act.
We rallied the world to support the brave people of Ukraine as they defend their liberty and their sovereignty with incredible dignity. I mean that from the bottom of my heart. Think about it. Think about what they're doing.
After nearly a year and a half of Russia's forces committing terrible atrocities, including crimes against humanity, the people of Ukraine remain unbroken. Unbroken. Ukraine remains independent. It remains free. And the United States has built a coalition of more than 50 nations to make sure Ukraine defends itself both now and is able to do it in the future as well.
Since this war began, I've stood with President Zelenskyyas I just spent about an hour with himboth in Washington, in Kyiv, in Hiroshima, and now in Vilnius, to declare to the world what I say again: We will not waver. We will not waver. I mean that. Our commitment to Ukraine will not weaken. We will stand for liberty and freedom today, tomorrow, and for as long as it takes.
We all want this war to end on just terms, terms that uphold the basic principles of the United Nations Charter that we all signed up to: sovereignty, territorial integrity. These are two pillars of peaceful relations among nations. One country cannot be allowed to seize its neighbor's territory by force.
Russia could end this war tomorrow by withdrawing its forces from Ukraine, recognize these international borders, and ceasing its attacks on itsinhumane attacks on RussiaI mean, by Russia on Ukraine, against its childrenwomen and children; its military.
Unfortunately, Russia has shown thus far no interest in a diplomatic outcome. Putin still wrongly believes that he can outlast Ukraine. He can't believe it's their land, their country, and their future.
And even after all this time, Putin still doubts our staying power. He's still making a bad bet that the conviction and the unity among the United States and our allies and partners will break down.
He still doesn't understand that our commitment to our values, our freedom is something he [we; White House correction] can never, never, ever, ever walk away from. It's who we are. I mean it: It's who we are. It's who we are.
Throughout this horrific war, the people of Lithuania, together with our Baltic brethren, have been among the fiercestmost fierce champions of Ukraine's right to a future of its own choosing: one that is free.
Because you lived so long with freedom denied, many of you who are older know better than anyone how precious the right to determine your own future is, precious to people everywhereeverywherenot just in Ukraine, but Belarus, Moldova, Georgia, all the places around the world where people continue to fight to make their voices heard.
So my messagemy messageto all of you tonight is: Keep it up. Keep it going. Keep reminding the world of hope that Lithuania embodies. And that's what you embody: hope in this country. [Applause] No, I really mean it. I'm not joking. I mean this sincerely.
We must never forget how much this matters and never, never give up on a better tomorrow. The defense of freedom is not the work of a day or a year. It's the calling of our lifetime, of all time.
We are steeled for the struggle ahead. Our unity will not falter. I promise you.
Folks, as I look around the world today, at a moment of war and peril, a moment of competition and uncertainty, I also see a moment of unprecedented opportunityunprecedented opportunityopportunity to make real strides toward a world of greater peace and greater prosperity, liberty and dignity, equal justice under the law, human rights and fundamental freedoms which are the blessing and birthright of all of humanity.
Thatthatis the world the United States is working toward. And it's one we'll only reach if we do it together, and I mean together.
We need to take the same spirit of unity, common purpose, determination that we have demonstrated in our response to Russian aggression in Ukraine and bring more partners along as we continue working to build a world we want to live in and a world we want for our children.
My friends, at the most fundamental level, we face a choiceit's not hyperbolewe face a choice: a choice between a world defined by coercion and exploitation, where might makes right, or a world where we recognize that our own success is bound to the success of others.
When others do better, we do better as well; where we understand that the challenges we face today, from the existential threat of climate change to building a global economy where no one gets left behind, are too great for any one nation to solve on their own, and that to achieve our goals and meet the challenges of this age, we have to work together.
And I mean this sincerely: The world is changing. We have a chance to change the dynamic. That's why I've been so focused as President on rebuilding and revitalizing these alliances that are the cornerstone of American leadership in the world.
These past years, we have brought the transatlantic partnership to new heights, reaffirming the importance of the relationship between Europe and the United States as an anchor to global stability. The idea that the United States could prosper without a secure Europe is not reasonable. We've also elevated[applause]that'sit really isn't. Not a joke.
I sometimeswellwe also elevated and deepened America's alliance in the Indo-Pacific with Japan, the Republic of Korea, Australia, and the Philippines, which provide critical security and deterrence in that vital region of the world.
Through our Quad partnershipit's a fancy way of saying our partnership with Australia, India, Japan, and the United Stateswe're bringing major democracies of the region together to cooperate, keeping the Indo-Pacific free and open, prosperous, and secure.
We've demonstrated during this NATO summit, with Indo-Pacific partners joining us for the second year in a row, we're working to deepen connections between the Atlantic and Pacific democracies so they can better work together toward the shared values we all seek: strong alliances, versatile partnerships, common purpose, collective action to meet our shared challenges.
The world has shrunk. That's how we build a future to see. But we share and know we share challenges and work together. We have to step up together, building the broadest and deepest coalition to strengthen and defend the basic rules of the road, to preserve all the extraordinary benefits that stem from the international system grounded in the rule of law.
We have to come together to protect the rights and freedoms; to underwrite the flow of ideas and commerce andwhich have enabled decades of global growth. Yes, territorial integrity and sovereignty, but also principles like freedom of navigation and overflight, keeping our shared seas and skies open so that every nation has equal access to our global common space.
And as we continue to explore this age of new possibilities, an age enabled by rapid advances in innovation, we have to stand together to ensure that the common spaces of our future reflect our highest aspirations for ourselves and for othersas my dad would say, that everybody hasis treated with some dignityso that artificial intelligence, engineering biology, and other engineering technologiesemerging technologies are not made into weapons of oppression, but rather they're used as tools of opportunity.
We're working with our allies and partners to build a supply chains that are more resilient, more secure, so we never again face a situation like we had during the pandemic where we couldn't get critical goods we needed for our daily lives.
You know, we all must summon the common will to actually address the existential threat of accelerating climate change. It's real. It's serious. And we don't have a lot of time. It is thethesingle greatest threat to humanity. And it's only by working together that we'll prevent the worst consequences of climate change from ravaging our future and that of our children and grandchildren.
We also have to recognize our shared responsibility to help unlock the enormous potential that exists in low- and middle-income companies [countries; White House correction] around the world, not out of charity, but because it's in our own self-interest. We all benefit when more partners stand together, working toward shared goals. We all benefit when people are healthier and more prosperous. And that's not, again, hyperbole. It's true. We all benefit when more entrepreneurs and innovators are able to pursue their dreams for a better tomorrow.
You know, so we need to update our toolset to better address the needs of today in this interconnected world, a world where climate disasters, pandemics, conflicts spill over borders and make it harder to address the challenges of poverty and instability that hold so many people back.
That's why the United States is leading an effort to transform the multilateral development banks, like the World Bank, to help them better address the global challenges while enhancing their core mission of reducing poverty and boost shared prosperity.
We're all working together with our partners in the G-7 to address the enormous needs for high-standard infrastructure around the world, especially in low- and middle-income countries in Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. It's a statement about the world we want to build together.
Ladies and gentlemen, we stand at an inflection point, an inflection point in history, where the choices we make now are going to shape the direction of our world for decades to come. The world has changed.
Will we turn back naked, unchecked aggression today to deter other worldwould-be aggressors tomorrow? Will we staunch the climate crisis before it's too late? Will we harness the new technologies to advance freedom, or will we diminish it? Will we advance opportunity in more places or allow instability and inequality to persist?
How we answer these essential questions is literally going to determine the kind of future our children and grandchildren have. And, again, that's not an exaggeration; that's a fact. It's going to take all of us. All of us.
I believe that with ambition, with confidence in ourselves and one another, with nations working together for common cause, we can answer these questions. We can ensure the vision we share and the freedoms we cherish are not just empty words in a troubled time, but a roadmapand I mean this literallya roadmap, a plan of urgent action toward a future we can reach, and we'll reach if we work together.
Folks, the road that lies before us is hard. It will challenge us, summon the best of ourselves to hold faith in one another and never give up, never lose hope. Never.
Every day, we have to make the choice. Every day, we must summon the strength to stand for what is right, to stand for what is true, to stand for freedom, to stand together.
And that, my friends, is the lesson we learn from history and the history of Lithuania's story. You know, it's the lesson we see demonstrated each day, and it will determineit will determinewhat the Ukraine looks like. And it is nowit's how we're going to workhow we rewrite the future of peace and hope, justice and light, liberty, possibilities for everyoneeveryone, everywhere.
Folks, some have heard me say to my country many times: I have never, ever in my entire career been more optimistic about the prospects of the future. Never. Never.
So let me just say thank you for taking the time to be here to listen.
God bless you all, and may God protect the freedoms of thethe protectors of freedom in Ukraine, here, in every nation in the world, everywhere. God protect our troops.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

The President. You all ready to go to Finland?
The President's Travel to Finland 
Q. Are you ready?
Q. How'd it go?
The President. I'm ready. Have you ever seen me not ready?
Anyway.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine/North Atlantic Treaty Organization Summit/Turkey/Sweden 
Q. How did your meeting with Zelenskyy go? Did you talk about long-range missiles?
The President. It went very well, and I think he'd tell you that. We spent about an hour together, and I think we're on the right track.
And so I'm feeling good about the trip. And you know, we accomplished every goal we set out to accomplish. I know there was some cynicism about whether I could talk the Turks into Sweden and
Ukraine/North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
Q. How long do you think it'll take to get Ukraine into NATO? I mean, it's not for a while, right?
The President. I think until the war is over.
But look, the one thing Zelenskyy understands now is that whether or not he's in NATO now is not relevant as long as he has the commitments thatyou remember my talking about saying we'd treat it likeguarantee his security, along with a number of other NATO countries, as it related to how we deal with, for example, Israellong term. So he's not concerned about that now. And
Crimea/Ukraine 
Q. Do you believe the issue of Crimea needs to be fully resolved?
The President. Say again?
Q. Do you feel the issue of Crimea needs to be fully resolved to mean the war is over?
The President. Seventeen other things need to be fully resolved too. Crimea is important, but there's much more to deal with. There's
Ukraine 
Q. Mr. President, what sort of update did President Zelenskyy give you on how their counteroffensive is going?
The President. Well, I'mI'm not at liberty to give you the detail of that. But it'swe talked at length about it with all his military people within there, and they'rethey're still optimistic, but they know it's a hard slog. And so, any rate.
But I don't think it'd be appropriate to
Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS)/Ukraine 
Q. Sir, are you thinking about sending ATACMSthe surface-to-surface missilesyet? Is that something that is on your mind at all yet?
The President. Yes, but they already have the equivalent of ATACMS now. What we need most of all is artillery shells, and they're in short supply. We're working on that.
And so he seemed very, very satisfied with everything we're doing, when we left.
Turkey/Sweden/North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
Q. Are you confidenton Turkeythat Senator Menendez will drop his objections to sending the F-16s to Turkey?
The President. I'm confident that Turkey will continue to support Sweden getting into NATO. And I'm confident that we'll be able to sell F-16s.
Thank you.
North Atlantic Treaty Organization/Russia 
Q. And, Mr. President, after this summit and all the support that the NATO gave for Ukraine, and the G-7, what kind of message does this send to President Putin?
The President. We're together. We're together.
Thank you.

2023-07-11 00:00:00,"Remarks Prior to a Meeting With President Gitanas Nauseda of Lithuania in Vilnius, Lithuania","
[President Nauseda's remarks were joined in progress.]
President Nauseda. And, first of all, I would like to remind you that we are celebrating one and100 years of our establishment of our diplomatic relations. Also, our cooperation recently is improving all the time.
But I would like also to thank for the nonrecognition policy of the United States regarding the occupation of Lithuania in the Soviet Union. It was very persistent policy. It helped usour spirit, moral spirit high. And I think this is very important to remember too.
The situation in our region is unfortunately deteriorating. And you see what is happening around us. And we see Belarus just swallowed into the Russian Federation, and we see that Belarus is becoming additional threat, additional factor of insecurity in the region.
So this is the reason why we asked the NATOwe asked our strongest ally, United Statesto pay a consistent attention to the security of our region. And I think the NATO summit, which takes place in Vilnius, in absolutely near proximity to adversary countries, this is symbolic eventsymbolic. But also, at the same time, this is a great opportunity to take the bold decisions, and we expect that they will be done.
This is very important to mention that we already have this Vilnius meeting as historical one, even before it started, because the membership of Sweden is already theon the table. And I think we will welcome the 32d member of NATO very soon.
We have regional defense plans approved, and now it's important that they become executable by the end of this year, with prepositioning, with assigned forces.
We are probablyLithuania is one of the most enthusiastic supporters of transatlantic bond in Europein European Union because we think that your participation, your attention is extremely important in this field of geopolitical uncertainty.
And at the same time, Lithuania is intending to buyto acquire military equipment from United States. And I would like to mention Black Hawks. Also, we intend to buy HIMARS, JLTVsOshkosh. And all this military equipment helps us to modernize our military forces.
At the same time, we are closely cooperating with Germany. And recently, the very good decision was announced by Defense Minister Boris Pistorius to scale up the forward presence of eFP country Germany in Lithuania up to brigade size on a permanent basis. So I think it would be very positive to welcome this decision and welcome the engagement of all eFP countries in the region to increase the forward presence in our region.
So, Mr. President, thank you so much for your participation in our NATO summit. I'm looking forward to closely cooperate with you and with our colleagues during these 2 days. I'm looking forward to be able to listen to your speech tomorrow in Vilnius University. It will be another historical moment for Lithuania.
And all the Lithuanian people greet you so warmly. Even Vilnius, you see it's a little bit empty right now, but this is because of security restrictions, and some people decided to leave the city just to avoid some inconveniences. But you know, in our heartsfrom bottom of our hearts, we welcome your visit, we welcome your arrival, and we are looking forward to cooperate with United States in the future.
President Biden. Well, Mr. President, thank you for the welcome, and thank your team as well.
You know, it's great to be back in Vilnius. I was here in 2014 as Vice President shortly after the Russian invasion of Ukraine the first time and, at the time, talked about what I thought Russia was likely to continue to do. Some people were somewhat skeptical of my judgment at the time andbut unfortunately, it turned out to be accurate.
And the United States is here today to reaffirm our commitment to NATO, but also to Vilnius. Look, we go back a long way. And thewhenwe're committed to Lithuania and to the Baltics and to NATO.
I rememberyou may recall when we were having the debate in the United States Senate about enlarging NATO, and I was arguing very strongly that the Baltics should all be a part of NATO. And you've been very, very added value.
And our pledge to be with you has not wavered. It didn't take us long to get thousands of troops here when Russia invaded the second time. We'll be able toyou can be assured that you're going to have all that you need.
We have the Secretary of Defense with us today. We can send him alone; he's enough. [Laughter] But all kidding aside, weand look, as I've said before: We take, NATO takes, all of us take article 5 literally. One inch of NATO territory means we're allwe're allin a war together against whomever is violating that space, and we're going to defend every inch of it.
And I want to thank you, Mr. President, for hosting this historic summit at an important time: the first time that NATO leaders will meet with 31 together, and looking forward to meeting very soon with 32 members, with the addition of Sweden. The leader of Sweden was just in my Oval Office not long ago, and we were hoping this would occur when it did. And I'm confident we'll get that done today.
And in the coming days, we're also going to discuss a range of issueshow to strengthen NATO's eastern flank and modernize NATO's deterrence and defense capabilities. And we're going to be doing it in a place ofwhere thosethose efforts truly matter every single, solitary day. And we're also going to discuss our support for the people of Ukraine. And I want to thank you andfor your partnership and leadership as we take on this challenge together.
So I look forward to our conversation today and to continuing to stand with you and all the people of Lithuania for a simple reason: shared values. We have the same value set. It's important. That's what NATO is all about. That's what transatlantic alliance is about.
And as you probably heard, I am a very strong supporter of the transatlantic alliance. I've learned that nothing happens here that doesn't affect us. So we're all in.
We're looking forward to today. Thank you.
President Nauseda. Thank you.

2023-07-11 00:00:00,"Remarks at an Official Greeting With Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Vilnius, Lithuania","
Secretary General Stoltenberg. President Biden, dear Joe, welcome to the NATO summit. And many, many thanks for your strong leadership making this alliance united and even stronger. This summit is already historic because the agreement we made yesterday will make Sweden a full member of NATO. And that will make our alliance even more capable of defending all allies.
At this meeting, we will also send a clear message to Ukraine that we stand by them as long as needed and also that we agree on a united and positive message on the path forward for Ukraine and membership for Ukraine.
Another major message from this summit will be that we need to invest more in our defense. And we will agree on a new defense investment pledge where we state clearly that 2 percent of GDP for defense is the minimum.
And the good news is that European allies and Canada are stepping up. This year, we have new numbers showing that they have added 8.3 percent in real terms for their defense budgets. This is a record high, and that demonstrates that allies are delivering on their commitments.
So, once again, Mr. President, it's great to have you here at the NATO summit.
President Biden. It's good to be here. And thank you for continuing to deliver.
Ias I've made nothe press is not at all surprised that I've been touting the fact that I think it's really important at this critical moment in Ukrainein the whole NATO issue that you continue to lead NATO. You're trusted. No one knows the situation that we're facing better than you do.
And this historic momentthe adding of Finland and Sweden to NATOit's consequential. And your leadership really matters. And theand we agree on the language that we proposed, that you proposed, relative to the future of Ukraine being able to join NATO.
And we're looking forward to continuing a united NATO. They've heard me saymy American press have heard me say many times I still think that President Putin thinks the way he succeeds is to break NATO. Not going to do that, especially with you as the lead of it.
So thank you for being willing to do it.
Secretary General Stoltenberg. Thank you so much.
President Biden. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Secretary General Stoltenberg. Thank you.

And you made all the more historic by the agreement you reached yesterday in the admission of Sweden and how you're going to proceed. I want to thank you for your diplomacy and your courage to take that on. And I want to thank you for your leadership, Mr. President.
This summit is reaffirming our commitment to NATO defense with close allies in NATO, and I hope we can make it even stronger.
So, welcome.
President Erdogan. Mr. President, my dear friend, I would like to, first of all, thank you for congratulating me in the aftermath of my reelection to my current post. And I'm grateful for the congratulatory messages that you have extended to me.
And within the framework of our strategic mechanism, I think it's high time for the heads of states to get together for further consultations. That's why I believe today's meeting with you within the margin of the NATO summit is the first step forward.
Our meetings prior to this were mere warmups, but now we are initiating a new process. This new process is a process of 5 years.
And now you are getting prepared for the forthcoming elections. And with the forthcoming elections, I would like to take this opportunity to also wish you the best of luck.

Great for us to carry on our conversations, which we were having just a month or so ago, it feels like, in the White House, where we signed the Atlantic Declaration, the first-of-its-kind economic partnership, which I know we'll be talking about today: how do we strengthen our cooperation, joint economic security to the benefit of our citizens.
But also, we head from here to NATO in Vilnius, where we stand as two of the firmest allies in that alliance. And I know we'll want to do everything we can to strengthen Euro-Atlantic security.
But great pleasure to have you here
President Biden. It's good to be back. You know, we've only been meeting once a month. [Laughter] This iswe met in San Diego, Belfast, Hiroshima, Washington, here. And couldn't be meeting with a closer friend and a greater ally.
And we've got a lot to talk about, and I think we're doing well. I think we're moving along in a way that is positive, but our relationship is rock solid between the United States, Great Britain. And I look forward to our discussions.

2023-07-07 00:00:00,Remarks on Health Care Cost Reduction Efforts,"
The President. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Please, have a seat. You know, Cory, what you've exposed is something that I think we don't pay enough attention to in Government. And it's not necessarily about health care, it's just about being played for a sucker.
When I started to deal with junk fees relating to airline costs, ticket seats, baggage, and the like, I think even some of the folks working with me thought, ""It's not that big a deal."" But you know, in Americait sounds cornybut fairness is something we kind of expect. And I don't know anybody who likes being viewed as having been played for a sucker, taken advantage of. People are ready to meet their responsibilities.
But I think this is a big deal. It's a big deal. And I have to thank my staffand I mean that sincerelyfor focusing on the health care piece. I didn't know some of this. I thought I knew a hell a lot about health care and[laughter]no, I've been a significant
[At this point, microphone feedback was heard.]
Sorry. [Laughter] I've been a significant consumer, and my family has as well.
But look, Cory, your story, it turns out, is a very familiar one to too many Americans. You try to do the right thing, only to get ripped off instead.
On too many nights, too many Americans lie in bed staring at the ceiling worrying what will happen if their spouse gets seriously ill; what will happen if something else happens to them. Do they have enough insurance? Will they have towill they have tohow are they going to pay their medical bills? Will they have to sell their home?
If you can holda point of personal privilege, as we used to say in the SenateI was telling my staff that I was raisedit was a middle class family. We weren't poor. We lived in a three-bedroom house with four kids and a grandpop, a split-level home, and my""the boys""quote, unquotenow, the princess, my sister, had her own bedroom[laughter]as she should have.
But the three boys werethere were fourthere were two sets of bunks in the other room. And there was a closet that ranas your walked down theyou walked up the stairs, you walk straight down the hall, you went into, quote, ""the boys' room""the three of us. And on the left, there was a closet in that whole wall. My parents' bed, headboard, was against thatwhere that closet was.
And every once in a while, rarely, myyou could hearyou could hear sort of a restlessness going on. You know, like, thejustand one morning, I get up, and I askI said, ""What's wrong with dad?"" He said that he just got word that his company said they're no longer going to pay for health insurance; doesn't know what they're going to do.
Well, you know, for all of you out there whoand there's so many people who still are in that circumstance. And talk about being deprived your dignity. Not being able to take care of your family if you don't have health insurance is, I think, one of the most consequential things that can happen to a person.
And so, you know, for all of you out there, I just want you to know: I get it. We get it. We have your back, and we're never going to stop fighting for you. And I promise you that.
You know, since I've been in office, we've been carrying out my economic vision
[As more feedback was heard, the President moved the handheld microphone to a shelf on the podium.]
All right[laughter]been carrying out my economic vision to moveto move from trickle-down economics whatto what everyone on the Wall Street Journalfrom the Wall Street Journal to Financial Times is calling ""Bidenomics."" It's about growing the economy from the middle out and the bottom up, andbecause when that happens, the folks at the bottom have a shot. They get a chance to rise up. And the wealthy still do very well. It's not to hurt anyone at all.
But today's job shows that I thinkjobs reportI think shows that Bidenomics is working. We added 200,000 jobsI think 209,000 jobs last month. And all told, we've created over 13 millionI think it's 13,300,000 jobs[applause]in 2 years. That's more than any President ever created in a 4-year term.
And, folks, the unemployment rate is below 4 percent for 17 straight months. Not since 1960 has that occurred. Inflation continues to fall. It's less than half of what it was a year ago. And the rate of Americans without health insurance is at an alltime low. Premiums for coverage under the Affordable Care Act are $800 less per person than before I took office. And that's Bidenomics.
Today I'm joined by health care advocates and leaders, many I'veif I started to name you all, we would be here all night. [Laughter] But I want to talk about key parts of my economic plan. We're protecting consumers and reducing health care costs withoutwithoutin any way hurting insurance companies, docs, hospitals, or anybody else.
You know, in my State of the Union Address, I outlined our fight to end junk fees, the hidden charges for companies who seeksneak into your bills things that you don't think you're going to pay for. Each year, those junk fees cost hundreds of dollars a month for tens of billionfor tens of billions of dollars, weighing ondown family budgets and making it harder for people to pay their bills.
Junk fees may not matter to the very wealthyand it's not the wealthy's fault, by the waybut they matter to working folks in homes like the ones I grew up in.
Over the past few monthsover the past few months, my administration has cracked down on junk fees across different industries: banking, hotels, concerts, tickets, airlines, cable, internetand the internet.
And today I'm pleased to announce that we're making some progress on health care.
First, my administration is cracking
[The President coughed.]
Excuse mecracking down on junk fees for health insurance plans that are like the ones that are inexpensive, but too often stick consumers with hidden fees.
As Cory just talked about, junk fee plans are ""short-term"" health insurances that are supposed to provide a few months of temporary coverage for people who are moving from one plan to another. But the prior administration before me decided to let insurance companies make more money by selling junk plans that are up to 3 years longup to 3 years long.
Americans thought they were buying temporary insurance that would provide real coverage in those plans. Instead, many have been saddled with thousands of dollars in medical bills these junk fees don't cover. And I think it's outrageous.
There are two main ways junk fees stick you with the high bills. The one way you just heard from Cory: He needed emergency surgery to get his appendix removed, but hidden in the frontin the fine print, his plan said it would only cover a fraction of the $37,000 the hospital bill was, even though he was paying his insurance premiums every month.
Another predatory way of getting around protection Barack and I fought so hard in the Affordable Care Act to accomplish, protecting millions of people with preexisting conditions, like cancer and heart disease. That was a way to get around that.
Just imagine if you had a heart attack and you expect your insurance company to pay for it, or you're diagnosed with a cancer and you expect your insurance company to pay for it. But they dig into your medical records, discover you had asthma as a kid, claim you had a heart attack was a preexisting condition, and then refuse to pay.
Folks, that's not health insurance, that's a scam. That's a scam. It has to end.
And, folks, today my administration is issuing a new rule that would close the loophole that allows these junk insurance plans to exploit Americans. Under our rule, ""short-term"" plans would have to be short term. That means 4 months or less, not 3 years. Insurance companies would also be required to provide a clear disclaimer upfront about what's covered and what is not covered, instead of burying it in fine print.
Second, we're cracking down on surprise medical bills, which I thought we had made some progress on. You've already heard stories about people who choose a hospital that's in their insurance network and they get a surprise bill for thousands of dollars because the hospital assigned them an anesthesiologist who wasn't in their network without them knowing that.
In January 2022, we ended surprise medical billing so hospitals that are in-network can't send you a surprise bill for an out-of-network doctor that you did not choose or even know he was consulted.
And over the past 18 months, we've protected 1 million Americans every single month from these surprise bills. But these are bills that cost people hundreds of thousands of dollars.
But get this: Some health care providers are trying to get around the rule by putting in place athe rule we put in place by preventto prevent the surprise billings. The travel industry figured out how to charge customers $90 a night in resort fees for hotels that aren't resorts. [Laughter] You think I'm kidding. [Laughter]
Hospitals are trying to do something similar by using different designations to charge their higher out-of-network rates or charging hidden facility fees for going to a doctor's office in the building owned by the hospital.
And some hospitals are working with credit card companies to promote medical credit cards. Sounds good. Consumers can use these cards to borrow the money to pay for the procedures and get charged, butin the hospitalbut they get charged higher interest rates as a result of that. It's wrong. It's wrong.
Today my administration is closing these surprise billing loopholes. Evading the law and playing games to charge patients outrageous prices has to end. It has to end.
And, folks, we're putting a stop to insurance companies gaming the networks and making them reveal any hidden facility fees. They've got to reveal them.
And for the first time in history, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Treasury are teaming up to investigate whether health care providers promoting medical credit cards are violating Federal law.
Third[applause]. Third, we're lowering prescription drug prices for seniors and people with disabilities. With your help, I signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act. Among the many important things it does, it finally gives Medicare the power to negotiate lower prescription drug prices like the Department of Veterans Affairs does now.
We've been trying to get this done for decades. I don't know how many times I made this speech on the floor of the United States Senate. [Laughter]
Audience member. Many.
The President. Along[laughter]yes, many[laughter]along with many others, but now. [Laughter] And this time, we finally beat Big Pharma. Seniors on Medicare who were paying as much as $400 a month for insulin are now paying $35 a month.
And I might add[applause]. I might add: The guy who invented the insulinthe guy who invented it, he didn't even patent it because he thought everybody should have access to it. It costs $10 to make. To package it may be as high as $13. They're still making three times what it cost them. It's not like they're being cheated.
You know, we also closed [capped; White House correction] the total out-of-pocket drug costs for seniors on Medicare at $2,000 a year, even for expensive drug costs like cancer drugs that are $10-, $12-, $14,000 a year.
Today the Department of Health and Human Services released a report showing that when these provisions go into effectit's notthey don't go into effect until 2025one in three Medicare beneficiariesthat's nearly 19 million peoplewill save an average of $400 a year.
Seniors with the highest drug costs will save an average of $2,500 a year. This is going to reduce out-of-pocket spending by Americans by nearly $7.5 billion annually. And guess what? It matters.
When we were negotiating the issue on whether the Government is going to stay open, I spoke to some of my MAGA Republican friends. It not onlyit not onlysaves the consumer, it saves every taxpayer. [Laughter] You're not paying that extra $7 billion because Medicare doesn't have to take the out-of-pocket and pay it.
Last week, the Centers for Medical [Medicare; White House correction] and Medicaid Services released the final guidance on how they'll negotiate with drug companies to lower prescription drug costs. On September 1, I'll announce the first 10 drugs selected for negotiation under the law.
This will not only save consumers money, it's going to save the Federal Government money, as I just referenced. Negotiating drug prices alongside other parts of my prescription drug plan is going to save the taxpayers so far $160 billion$160 billion.
It lowers drug costs of prescription drugs, and it lowers the deficit. It lowers the deficit. And I might add: All the talk about I'm ""Big Spendin' Biden,"" I lowered the deficit[laughter]1 trillion 700 billion dollars in the first 2 years. No one has ever done that. The last guy increased it by 40anyway, I won't go into it. [Laughter]
Well, that's Bidenomics in action. [Laughter]
But guess what? Big Pharma doesn't want this to happen, so they're suing us to block us from negotiating lower prices so they can pad their profits while hard-working Americans foot the bill.
But what we're going towe're going to see this through. We're going to keep standing up to Big Pharma. And we'll also stand up to MAGA Republicans who have been trying for years to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. They've tried 70,000 times, I think.
To deny Americansto deny Americansaccess to the Affordable Health Care Acton my watch, health care is not a privilege in this country. It should be a right.
And, folks[applause]but let melet me close with this. When I ran for President, I promised I would not continue the trickle-down economics of the past, because here's the simple truth: Trickle-down economics represented the moment we walked away from how this country was built in the first place. Bidenomics is just the other way around: restoring the American Dream.
Forty years of trickle-down economics limit the dream to those at the top. I believe that every American willing to work hard should be able to get a good job, afford good health care no matter where they live, in every part of the country, if they're willing to work.
That's the American Dream. That's Bidenomics.
And that's why I can honestly say I've neverI really haveIknow I don't look like it, but I've been around a while. [Laughter] But all kidding aside, I've never been more optimistic about America's future than I am today. I really mean that. I genuinely mean that.
We just have to remember who in God's name we are. We're the United States of America. There is nothing, nothing beyond our capacity if we work together. There's not a single major problem we've decided to solve as a country together that we've not succeeded in doing. Not a single one.
So why are we stopping now? There's so much opportunity. And because of all of you and the minds and the courage that you all represent in this roomI really mean itthere's no reason why we can't continue this.
And by the way, we're going to be fair. The suppliers, the drug companies, they're still going to do very well. Everybody is going to just do fine. I'm just tired of seeing Americans ripped off.
God bless you all, and God protect our troops. Thank you.

2023-07-06 00:00:00,"Remarks on the National Economy in West Columbia, South Carolina","
The President. Hello, South Carolina!
Thank you, Nikki, for that
[At this point, the President tried to move the podium riser in.]
if you wonder what I'm kicking here, I'm kicking this stand in. [Laughter] But it's not working.
[The President moved the riser out of the way with his foot.]
How about that? All right, maybe I stand on it and give myI'll be 6'4"". [Laughter]
Folks, thank you[inaudible]for being here. And I want to particularly thank my good friend Jim Clyburn. The truth of the matter isall of you know it in South CarolinaI wouldn't be standing here were it not for Jim Clyburn. [Laughter]
Jim has been one of the most consequential leaders in South Carolina history, in my view. He's tough, he's loyal, he's principled. Andand he let meI want to tell you something: If he has your back, youhe always has your back.
And, Jim, it's good to be back in your home with you and your daughter.
And look, former Mayor Steve Benjamin couldn't be here todayand you all remember Steve as your mayorbecause he's traveling with his family. And it's great to have him herehave him part of our team. But his mom and dad are here.
By the way, if you have seats, sit down. [Laughter] I'm sorry. I once said, ""Everybody take a seat,"" and there were no seats. They said, ""Biden is so stupid, he didn't know there were no seats."" [Laughter] Anyway.
Also want to thank the leadership of Enphase and Flex for hosting us.
You know, I'm here to talk about what we're doing to invest in Americaand I mean invest in America, all of America, starting here South Carolinaand to talk about the progress we made in building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not trickling down. When thewhen you build from the middle out and bottom up, everybody does well, and the wealthy still do very well. With that trickle-down economy, not a whole lot dropped on my dad's kitchen table growing up.
It's all part of an economic vision for this country. I came to office determinedto the point ofsome on my own team thought I was too determinedto change the economic direction of this country, to move trickle-down economics and get rid of it for everyone, fromthe Wall Street Journal to the Financial Times called the program ""Bidenomics."" I'm not sure they meant it as a compliment at the time. [Laughter]
Our plan is working. And one of the things I'm proudest of is that it's working everywhere, not just in the coasts and big cities, like previous recoveries. This time, investment is workingand factories being built and jobs being createdhappening in rural America, the heartland, all across America, in communities that have been left out and hollowed out.
This is what it looks like across the country. Over 13 million new jobs since I've been elected to office, more jobs than any President's ever created in their first 2 years. Nearly 800,000 manufacturing jobs, including 14,000 in this State alonethis State alone. And again, that's morethat's more in 2 years than was created in 4 years in any other administration.
Unemployment has been below 4 percent for the longest time in 50 years. Inflation is less than half of what it was a year ago, and we're continuing to work on it.
You know, I know we have more to do. Bringing down inflation remains one of themy top priorities. Job satisfaction nationallynationallyis at a 36-year high. The share of working-age Americans in the workforce is as high as it's been in 30 years. Remember they used to say, ""Biden is spending all this money to keep people from working""? People are off the sidelines. Twenty yearstwenty years highhigher than every single one of my predecessors.
And to pay for low-wage workersthe pay for low-wage workers has grown at the fastest pace in two decades. And, folks, it's no accident. It's Bidenomics in action.
Trickle-down economics has failed the country for decades. It means slashing public investment on things that helped America lead the world in innovation. You know, we used to invest 2 percent of our entire gross domestic product in research and development. You know what it is now? Point-7 percent.
We used to be ranked number one in the world in research and development. Know what we're ranked now? Number nine. China was number eight a decade ago, and now China is number two. And other countries are closing in fast.
This is the United States of America, for God's sake. We used to have the fastestthe best infrastructure in the world, rated number one. Now we're rated number 13 in the world in infrastructure. How can you have the best economy in the world and not have the best infrastructure in the world?
Under my predecessor, Infrastructure Week became a punchline. Everyeveryevery monthanyway. It's justI won't get into it. [Laughter] On my watch, we're making infrastructure a decade headline. A decade.
Yesterday, we announced that since I took office, we have attracted a half a trillion dollars$497 billionin private investment in American manufacturing, both here and around the world. It's historic, and it's Bidenomics in action. Instead of exporting jobs to cheaper labor costswhat we did for decadeswe're creating jobs here and exporting American product. Product, not jobs. That's the story here in South Carolina.
Earlier, we heard the leadership of Enphase say that $60 million they're investing here. Well, that's 1,800 jobs across the country and up [to; White House correction] 600 permanent jobs right here in South Carolina, all a direct result of the so-called Inflation Reduction Act I wrotewe wrote and passed.
Well, that's the legislation that passed where so much money is coming in to make all this happen. And by the way, parenthetically, I want you toyou're going to hear about the deficitI cut the deficit $1.7 trillion in 2 years. Nobody has ever done that. Cut the debt 1.7. This generates income. It generates growth.
Enphase first commercialized the component that converts solar energy into electricity. All that solar energy doesn't do a whole lot of good if you can't do it and convert it into electricity. It's calledthey invented a thing called a solar microinverter.
Jobs that used to go to Mexico, India, Romania, and China are now coming home to South Carolina. Now Enphase is partnering with Flex to make these parts here in South Carolina. And today, they're shipping their first microinverters made in America. Made in America.
And the good news is 90 percent of these jobs require intelligence but don't require a college degree. And Flex is working with Midlands TechMidlands Technical College in Columbia to develop training and pathways so folks can get these jobs.
Since I took office, we've seen over 60 domestic manufacturing announcements all across the solar supply chain. One of the biggest is in Dalton, Georgia. You may find it hard to believe, but that's Marjorie Taylor Greene's district. [Laughter] I'll be there for the groundbreaking. [Laughter]
Look, and just today the Department of Energy announced new incentives for companies to bring solar power manufacturing back to our shores. We're in a real race; China is ahead of us. This is another step in helping us meet the goal of a hundred percent clean, renewable energyelectricity by 2035. By 2035, all electricity in America is going to be generated by clean energythat's a big dealand saving billions of tons going into the air of pollution.
We see the same story in semiconductors, those small, little computer chips the size of the tip of your finger that affect nearly everything in our lives, from your cellphone to automobiles and refrigerators to the most sophisticated weapons systems. They need these.
And guess what? America invented these chips. We're the ones that invented them. We sophisticated those chips. We made them what they are.
But over time, we went from producing nearly 40 percent of the world's chips down to less than 10 percent. That's why we designed and I signed the CHIPS and Science Actall these names don't mean much until you know what they producebecause I knew we had to reclaim America's leadership.
Now, all over the country, semiconductor companies are investing a record hundreds of billions of dollars to bring chip production back home in Ohio, New York, Arizona, all across thelike outside Columbus, Ohio, Intel is investing, in a thousand acres outside of Ohio, $20 billion. Twenty billion. It's going to take 7,000 people to build the twothey call them ""fabs""factories. And it's going to take 5,000 permanent workers.
Near Syracuse, Micron is investing up to $100 billion over the next 20 years, beginning now. In Phoenix, Arizona, TSMC is investing $40 billion, producing thousands of good-paying jobs.
As I said, for example, in Ohio, those 7,000 jobs building the facility are going to generate economic growth in that entire region outside of Columbus because they're generatingthey bring alongyou need storage, you need drugstores, you need a lot of things to maintain those jobs. And we're also seeing 3,000 jobsthose 3,000 jobs working in the fabs. You can make $100,000 a year. That's the average salary. And you don't need a college degree, making a hundred grand. The middle classthe middle classthis is a game changer, where ""Investing in America"" agenda is about bringing supply chains home, a clean energy future, made in America.
Before the pandemic, supply chains weren't something most Americans thought about. If I said to you 6 years ago, ""We're worried about a supply chain,"" you'd look at me like, ""Huh?"" Well, I would have looked at you the same way. But today, after delays in parts and products, everybody knows why supply chains matter. We know for too long China has dominated the production of raw materials needed for critical products. That's why we're building alliances with our friends all across the world, increasing our production here at home to create alternative sources for the minerals we need.
Our goal is to bring the full battery supply chain home. We create a ""Battery Belt"" stretching from Michigan to Georgia.
In Chester County, South Carolina, Albemarle is investing $1.5 billion to process lithium for electric vehicle batteries. That's not only will create 3,000300 permanent jobs, but it will lift up a whole communitya whole communityrestore some pride. It matters.
The lithium will power components like ourlike thelikeit's going to be takingbeing made in Redwood Mineralsexcuse meRedwood Materials near Charleston, where the company is making the largest investment in the State ofin the history of this State: $3.5 billion to build a battery materials manufacturing plant, creating 1,500 jobs. That's another community changer. It's a game changer.
And those materials will go into batteries that will be recycled by companies like Cirba Solutions, which is investing $300 million here in Richland County, creating another 300 permanent jobs. That's community after community after community there's been that change. And it's on its way. If you change enough communities, it's going to change the State, it's going to change the country.
In Jim Clyburn's district, Promega [Pomega; White House correction] Energy Storage Technologies is investing 279 billion dollarsmillion dollarsmillionto manufacture batteries to store energy to power the grid.
Look, what do you think we'd have said thatif I came when I was here trying to get the nomination 3 years ago and I told you whileyou know, while I was campaigning, that we'd see this kind of investment in South Carolinabillions of dollars?
I think you would've been a little skeptical. But that's why I fought so hard for the things I wanted to do. We didn't get much help from the other team, but that didn't stop us from getting it done. And that's going to transform America.
All told, since I signed the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS and Science Act into law, companies have announced $11 billion in manufacturing and clean energy investments just in South Carolina. Eleven billion dollars.
Companies across the countyor, excuse me, across the country are expanding factories, building new ones, creating tens of thousands of good-paying jobs, most of which don't require a 4-year degree.
And when I say every job in America should be a good job, including a free and fair choice to join a union, I mean it.
Audience member. That's right!
The President. Every venture to manufacture clean energy technology would be made stronger by collective bargaining relationships. But that's up to you do decide.
It's not justit's not just manufacturing. Through the bipartisan infrastructure law, we've already announced over 35,000 projects all across America, like the Brent Spence Bridge, which is a billion-dollar operation, over the Ohio River from Ohio to Kentucky.
And today, in New York, we're investing a recorda billion dollars to renew the Hudson Tunnel. You walk through that tunnel, it was built a hundred years ago. It's falling apart. You'll be able to go through it a hundred miles an hour instead of 30 miles an hour.
Up in Union County, South Carolina, we're rebuilding six bridges critical to moving people and goods across this region. Each bridge is over 60 years old with weight and volume restrictions that cause detours, congestion, and supply chain delays. The oldest one is where South Carolina 49 crosses the Tyger River. The biggest one is right here in Columbia: ""malfunction junction."" [Laughter] You all know it.
How many years you've been talking about fixing ""malfunction junction""? Well, now, thanks to Jim Clyburn and help from the infrastructure law, it's finally going to get fixed. It's going to get fixed.
And we're removing every single lead pipe in America. More than 100,000 lead service lines go into homes here in South Carolina. And they're a risk to everyone's health, including children, so it's time to get them removed and replaced.
We're building. We're helping Richland School District One here in Columbia purchase 16 new electric buses. Because, guess what? The diesel buses cause asthma. They cause problems. They cause additional problems.
You all remember, during the pandemic, that thousands of people in this State didn't have a connection to a high-speed internet, whereverin their business or their home. Everybody now talks about, ""We're going to close that digital divide,"" that divide between those who have a reliable internet connection and those who don't.
South Carolina is receiving $1 billion to close that divide[applause]connecting every home and small business across rural America and rural South Carolina that doesn't have reliable high-speed internet.
Thanks to Jim Clyburn's Affordable Connectivity Programfancy name, but it's realthat's saying that 359,000 South Carolinian families are already saving $30 a month on their internet bills.
Look, we're doing this in communities all over the country. You can see exactly where the money is going and whether you're affected in your community here by going to invest.gov. Click onto invest.gov, put in your location, and they'll tell you what's happening in your community. You'll all see projects we're delivering in communities all across America.
Look, implementing this legislation also has another transformative impact. All those Members of Congress who voted against it suddenly realize how great it is, and they're bragging about it. As my mother would say, ""God love them."" [Laughter]
I want to thank Senator Graham for voting for the bipartisan infrastructure law and the CHIPS and Science Act, but I wish he'd voted for the rest.
Every Republican Member of the Congress voted against the Inflation Reduction Act. Every one. Every Republican Member of the House in this State voted to repeal the clean energy provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act thatthat attachedattracted all these jobs.
You know, and then, after that effort failed, the Republican Study Committee, which includes over three-quarters of the House Republicans, just released a plan to go at trying to repeal it all again. That hasn't stopped them, though, from claiming credit[laughter]now that billions of dollars and thousands of jobs are coming to the United States.
It's not unusual. The distinguished Senator from the State of Alabama, a former coach of the university, strongly opposed the bipartisan infrastructure law. He's now hailing its passage. He said, quote, ""Great to see Alabama receive critical funds to boost ongoing broadband efforts."" [Laughter] It is great. But that's alright, because I'm one of those guys who believe in conversion. [Laughter]
Look, folks, on a very serious note, when I ran, when I got elected, when I proposed these pieces of legislation, I made a commitment that I would be President for all Americans, whether their elected officials voted for thethe events or notall Americans, whether you voted for me or not. And I've kept my promise.
In fact, some analysis have said that the laws I've signed are going to do more to help red America than blue America. Well, that's okay with me, because we're all Americans. Because my view is: Wherever the need is most, that's the place we should be helping. And that's what we're doing. Because the way I look at it, the progress we're making is good for all Americans, all of America.
Let me close with this. I'm not here to declare victory on the economy. I'm here to say we have a plan that's turning things around quickly, but we have a lot more work to do.
When I came to office, we had a fundamental decision to make: Would we continue down the trickle-down economic patha policy that's failed us time and againthat grew inequality, that saw jobs shipped overseas, towns hollowed out?
When I ran, I promised we would not continue down the trickle-down path. But here's the simple truth about trickle-down economics: It represented a moment when we walked away from how this country was built.
Bidenomics is just another way of saying ""restoring the American Dream."" Forty years of trickle-down limited that dream to those at the top. But I believe that every American willing to work hard should be able to get a good job no matter where they livein the heartland, in the small towns, in every part of this countryto raise their kids on a good paycheck and keep their roots where they grew up.
That's the American Dream. My dad used to have an expression forgrowing up. My word. He'd say: ""Joey, a job is a lotabout a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay,' and mean it.""
That's Bidenomics. It's rooted in what always worked best for this country: investing in America. Because when you invest in our people, when you strengthen the middle class, we see stronger economic growth that benefits everybody.
I've long said it's never been a good bet to bet against America. And I can honestly say it's never beenI've never been more optimistic about America's future. We just have to remember who we are, for God's sake. We are the United States of America. There is nothing beyond our capacity if we work together. So let's continue to work together.
God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you.

2023-07-05 00:00:00,Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson of Sweden and an Exchange With Reporters,"
President Biden. Well, Mr. Prime Minister, it's great to see you. You're a valued, valued friend, and it's an honor to welcome you to the White House.
And Sweden is a capable and committed partner. Together, we're preparing our relationship foreven further, including advancing the bilateral partnership agreement we're talking about.
But we're also prepared for the NATO summit next week. And I want to reiterate: The United States fully, fully, fully supports Sweden's membership in NATO.
And the bottom line is simple: Sweden is going to make our alliance stronger and has the same value set that we have in NATO. And I'm really lookinganxiously looking forward for your membership.
And I know with that bilateral relationship, Sweden and the United States are taking on the challenges that matter most to our people, from taking on the climate crisis to preserving a free and open Indo-Pacific. So, across the board, we seem to be in agreement on most everything.
And we're stepping up to protect our shared democratic values, including providing security and humanitarian assistance to the people of Ukraine. And the generosity of the Swedish people has been extreme. You've done a great, great deal as the brave people of Ukraine defend themselves against Russia's brutality.
And together, our countries and companies are working in lockstep on emerging technologies, includingI want to thank you, Mr. Prime Minister, for your work onto build a safe 5G and 5C network6G networks.
And I want to thank you again for being here. We've got a lot to cover. And I yield to you, Mr. Prime Minister.

I believe that Sweden and the U.S., we share so many values and priorities since long, but not least right now. That goes for how to handle the war in Ukraine. I thank you for your leadership, the transatlantic unity that you have made so much to establish. That goes also to how to tackle the climate crisis, mitigating climate change. That goes for handling the transatlantic way the challenges that China creates for democracies.
And I also would like to say that we highly appreciate your strong support for Sweden's NATO accession. That means a lot to us. We do seek common protection, but we also do think that we have things to contribute with to be a security provider for the whole of NATO. So
President Biden. That's clear.
Prime Minister Kristersson. I very much look forward to our talks here today. Thank you so much.
President Biden. Well, I'm looking forward to this getting finished because you're an extremely valuable and capable partner.

2023-07-04 00:00:00,Remarks to the National Education Association Annual Meeting and Representative Assembly,"
The First Lady. Thank you. [Laughter] Hello, NEA.
Hi, Becky. How are you? And how's this year's RA going?
[National Education Association President Rebecca S. Pringle spoke via videoconference from the Orange County Convention Center in Orlando, FL.]
Ms. Pringle. Well, you know, there's nothing better I want to do than spend the Fourth of July with almost 7,000 of my closest friends. It doesn't get better than that, Jill! [Laughter]
Ms. Pringle. It just doesn't. Wow.
The First Lady. You know, Becky, I was listening to all of the questions and comments that the educators were making, and I have to say, I think I beat them all; I've just signed my new contract, and I think this is year 39 for me as a teacher.
Ms. Pringle. So that's fabulous. So, speaking of that, Dr. Biden, how do you, as an educator, use your summernow, you don't really getnobody gets a summer off, right? But you know, as you end one term and you start the next, how do you recharge yourself and prepare for that schoolyear ahead?
The First Lady. Well, I think like a lot of the members there, you know, I do some work, you know, during the summer and, of course, I have that other job that you know about. You know, but I always try to take a week or two to relax.
Ms. Pringle. Yes, keep doing that other job too, Jill. [Laughter] Yes.
The First Lady. So I catch up on the books that I've been wanting to read. You know, and I'm an English teacher, so, you know, I'm reading everything I can get my hands on. So, if you have any good suggestions, will you just text them to me? [Laughter]
Ms. Pringle. We absolutely will.
The First Lady. Okay. Because I'm
Ms. Pringle. We're on it.
The First Lady. always looking for some good books. And you know, I go to the beach; I'll be going tomorrow. And I like to, you know, go for some bike rides and some walks.
But you know, even though I try not to think about the fall, I'm always thinking about how I can change my curriculum, and already, I've been reading the papers, looking for articles that I want my students to write about. So I think I'm very muchyou know, we're all the same.
You know, I think that now, you know, it's aboutwe're almostI hate it when people say July 4th, ""Well, the summer is half over."" You know, I hate to hear that because it's just like it's going so quickly.
But I know that we don't have much time left. So, you know, there's sort of a mix of sadnessright?that the summer is going by so quickly, but I always look forward to the year ahead, and I'm alwaysyou know, I'm already checking my rolls to see if my classes are full.
Sobut it's good to join a group of people that know exactly how I feel: all of my fellow NEA members.
And you know, I knew that Joe would always be the education President, because he knows that our Nation'syou know, the success of our Nation starts with you, the educators who shape our students' lives.
And so, you know, we've invested so much in our schools and our counselors and our nurses and administrators who make them all successful. And as he transforms, you know, our economy, creating millions of jobs that are shaping the future, he knows that education is key to filling those critical roles.
And I want you to know that he hears you. You know, when I was listening, Ithe things that I heard aboutthe gun control, theyou know, keeping our students safe, mental health in our schools, paythe Biden-Harris administration is listening, and we hear you.
And we know that, you know, for most people, a high school diploma alone isn't enough to find a great career, but that doesn't mean that the only pathway to success is a 4-year college degree.
And as First Lady, you know, I've traveled this country, and I've met so many amazing educators who are helping students explore and find their passions. Starting in middle and high school, they're creating opportunities to learn about computers and electric vehicles and wind turbines. You know, this is the future.
They're helping young people find registered apprenticeships and dual enrollment programs, which means they start in high school and, even younger, middle school, and they start thinking about their careers and how they're going to get into those careers.
That's the Biden education pathway. And it starts with free, high-quality universaltotallypreschool and creates a kindergarten through 12th-grade experience that prepares our students for their next steps.
And it supports apprenticeships and provides 2 years of affordable community college, with avenues for students who decide, ""You know, maybe I want to go to a 4-year college, or maybe I don't."" But this is the future of our workforce, a future that all of you make possible.
And together, through the Biden education pathway, we can fundamentally transform what it means to make a living and make a life here in America.
And now, I'd like to introduce the man who will never stop fighting for you, who knows how important teachers and unions are to our students and to our country, my husband, the education president, Joe Biden.
The President. Happy Fourth of July. I'm Joe Biden. I am Jill Biden's husband. [Laughter]
Folks, let me start by saying educators have champions in the White House.
Jill reminds meand I mean this sincerelyall the time, teaching is not just what you all do, it's who you are. It's who you are. And I know the last few years have been incredibly difficult. We ask so much of you. And I want you to know I see you, we see you, we thank you. And we thank you, Becky, for your leadership.
You know, I've often sayand you're tired of hearing me saying it, probablybut children are the kite stringsthey're not somebody else's childrenthey're all our childrenare the kite strings that lift our national ambitions aloft, and you hold those strings. You hold those strings. And our job is to make sure you have what you need to do what you do best.
That's why, through the American Rescue Plan, we delivered critical support for schools, including funding for afterschool programs, summer programs, hiring more teachers, counselors, school psychologists.
Folks, in fact, more than 80 percent of school superintendents say they're using those funds in the American Rescue Plan to help students recover academically and to address mental health crisis facing so many of our young people as a consequence of the pandemic.
We're going to be talking about the pandemicourthose who succeed usfor a long time. It had profound impact, and it had negative impacts. And we're working like hell to make itto overcome it.
Compared with before the pandemic, the number of school nurses is now up 22 percent, the number of school social workers is up 43 percent. But we're just getting started.
You know, we expect teachers to solve every problemevery problem.
We need to provide access to preschool for 3- and 4-year-olds so they get to classroom ready to learn.
And by the way, recent studies have indicated that if you start schoolnotdaysdaycare, schoolat 3 years old, no matter what your background is, no matter what home you come from, you have an incredible opportunity.
You all know all the data and statistics: that a kid going from a broken home and a tough circumstance is going to hear a million fewer words spoken by the time they get to first grade, or they're going to find themselves in a situation where they aretheir vocabulary is considerably less.
Since I took office, we've added 100,000 public school teachers, and we're going to continue working to address the teacher shortage. It's critical. It's critical. [Applause] No, really. This is a national security issue.
It starts with paying teachers and educators what they're worth. We're making it easier for teachers to[applause]you've got it, kid. That's why I know how to say, ""Not labor, but unionsunions.""
We're making it easier for teachers to enter the field in the first place, which is why we're already helped nearly 20 States put in place registered apprenticeship programs. These programs give aspiring teachers the chance to train under experienced teachers, like all of you, while earning a paycheck and not having to take on more student debt.
Another thing we can do[applause]isto help with the educator shortage is to reduce the burden teachers face paying back their loans. When I came to office, there was a program called the Public Loan Service Forgiveness [Public Service Loan Forgiveness; White House correction] program. It was a total mess. And this was designed, if you'd engage in public service, you can get your debt forgiven for education.
We forgave more student loans to teacherswe had tothey had to be engaged in public servicenot just teachers, but social workers and others, police officers, et cetera. But the program was too complicated, too difficult to take advantage of. But Jill and I were determined to fix it, and we have.
Since I've been in office, there are now more than 615,000 teachers, nurses, police officers, and others, who have been able to get as much asloans in that $42 billion forgiven so far. Forty-two billion.
And by the way, the program is still there. Go toanyway, you ought to contact us to make sure you know exactly how to qualify, because you deserve that forgiveness.
Finally, as you know all too well, educators now find themselves on the front lines of gun violence. All yoursome of your members talked about it, Jill talked about. With your help, we passed the most significant bipartisan gun safety legislation in 30 years, but it's not nearly enough.
I was one of those guys, early on, when I was a Senator, who helped pass the assault weapons ban. And we had to onlywe could only get it for 10 years, and one of the Republican administrations got rid of it.
But Congress needs to step up, pass commonsense gun safety laws to protect our kids and educators.
And by the way, arming teachers is not the answer. Arming teachers is not the answer. Banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, extensive background checksthey're part of the answer. They'll make a big difference.
And one more thing: Let's stand with teachers and educators against politicians who are trying to score political points by banning books. Did you all ever think you'd be in a situation, in the United States of America, we're talking about banning books? And the people deciding who towhat books to ban? Come on. That's not who we are.
Let me close with this. So many of us are here, at least in part, because somewhere along the way an educator believed in us, helped us believe in ourselves.
I know that was the case for me in grade school, high school, and in college. I used to stutter very badly. I had teachers in grade school and then in high school who convinced me it couldn't define me, I wouldn't let it define me. And they helped me.
I had a professor at the University of Delaware who became one of my greathe's the reason I ran. I didn't think I could. I didn't think I should. And he'd talkhe said, ""Remember what Plato said, Joe?"" I'm trying to think, ""What the hell did Plato say?""
But what he said was[laughter]to paraphrase him, he said: ""The penalty good people pay for not being involved in politics is being governed by people worse themselves. Run, Joe. Run."" That's the power of a great educator. No, I really mean it. Think aboutall of you had somebodysomebody in your education who was just there for you, gave you confidence.
We owe our Nation's educators so much. And I'm here to say, we have your back. We're committed to supporting all of you, just like you support the Nation's future and our children.
Folks, this Independence Day, we should be more optimistic than ever. We have to remember who we are. We're the United States of America. We have never, never failed to accomplish a goal we set out to accomplish when we've done it together.
There's nothingnothingbeyond our capacity when we do it together. We've come out of every crisisunlike any other nation in the world today, we've come out of every crisis we've faced atin the past 247 years stronger than we entered that crisis. We're doing it again.
I've never been more optimistic than I am today. I really mean it. Never been more optimistic. There's so much we can do. We're on the edge. And the American people are figuring out what the other team is talking about, and they don't like it.
So, folks, happy Fourth of July. Thank you, thank you, thank you for everything you do.
May God bless you all, and may God bless our Nation's educators.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2023-07-04 00:00:00,Remarks at an Independence Day Celebration,"
The First Lady. Thank you, Chaplain Barkemeyer. And thank you to the USO for helping to make this event so special and for being such a great partner to my White House Joining Forces initiative that supports military and veteran families, caregivers, and survivors.
Secretary Austin, Charlene, my fellow military families, welcome to the White House!
All across the country and at bases around the world, people are gathering with family and friends to celebrate the birth of our Nation.
But even as we laugh with our neighbors and enjoy the parades and cookouts and fireworks, we can never lose sight of the freedoms that this day represents or the families who make that freedom possible, families like all of you.
You are the brave and the bold, and the nearly 1 percent of Americans who have made the choice to keep us all safe. You miss births and birthdays, graduation and weddings, because you choose to put our country's security above your own.
And you're the spouses and children who serve as well, saying goodbye to friends and jobs, losing sleep when your servicemember is away, putting your chin up and your shoulders back no matter what this country asks of you. We are so grateful for all that you do. And our thoughts are with those serving overseas.
As a military mom and as your First Lady, I am honored and proud to share today with you, and I'm proud to be part of this military family.
God bless our troops and their families, and have a happy Fourth of July!
And now, your Commander in Chief, my husband, President Joe Biden.
The President. Well, happy Fourth.
Audience members. Happy Fourth!
The President. Today we celebrate our independence. We celebrate our liberty and our freedom. And Jill and I are honored to spend the day with so many military families. You represent a link in the chain of honor that stretches back to our founding days. You are the sinew, the backbone, the reality of why we're who we are. Unbreaking. Unbending.
Throughout our history, you remind us that democracy is never, never, never guaranteed. Every generation must fight to maintain it. We must always cherish it, defend it, and strengthen it.
You know, as we remember the extraordinary country this is, I hope we all rededicate ourselves to the essential work of our democracy, which is to unifyto unifyunify this Nation, to see each other not as adversaries, but as fellow Americans.
And let us remember that. While otherwhile the other nations were formed based on things like geography, ethnicity, religion, America is the only nation in history founded on an ideaan idea. And that is that we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all people are created equalall peopleendowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, among them life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
We haven't always lived up to those words, but we've never walked away from them. And today, and all days, we have to say clearly: We never will. We never will.
Folks, this year, we honor the 50th anniversary of the All-Volunteer Force50 years; 75th anniversary of desegregating the military; and the 75th anniversary of women's official integration into the military, full blown.
I've had the great honor of appointing some military commandershaven't I?that are women.
Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III. That's right.
The President. Yes. [Laughter] A lot. Any ratethis is a great guy, by the way.
[At this point, the President gestured toward Secretary Austin.]
This is a great guy. He has incredible, incredible integrity.
And though we've made enormous progress as a nation, and that's due to the people of this Nationthe people of this Nationnot the politicians, the peoplewe just have to keep going. You know, we just have to keep the faith. And we just have to remember who we are. We are the United States of America. And there's nothingnothingbeyond our capacity if we work together.
Ladies and gentlemen, we've come out of every single solitary crisis stronger than we went in for 247 years. That's not hyperbole, that's a fact. We're the only nation that has.
So, folks, happy Fourth of July. God bless you, and may God protect our troops.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2023-06-30 00:00:00,Remarks on the United States Supreme Court Decision on the Federal Student Loan Debt Relief Program and an Exchange With Reporters,"
The President. Hello, folks.
Q. Hello, President.
The President. There you go, Mr. Secretary.
Let me begin by saying I know there are millions of Americansmillions of Americansin this country who feel disappointed and discouraged, or even a little bit angry, about the Court's decision today on student debt. And I must admit I do too.
Before I tell you the steps we're going to take, I wanted to talk about what we've been ableI want to talk about what we've been able to achieve so far on student loan over the past few years.
First, we made the largest increase in Pell grants in over a decade, helping students from families who nearly all make less than $60,000 a year. Then we fixed the so-calledwith the help of the departmentPublic Service Loan Forgiveness program so that borrowers who got into public servicesuch as schoolteachers, police officers, social workers, servicemembersyou know, they actually got the debt relief they're entitled to under the law.
Before I came to office, only 7,000 people had benefited from that program. Today, over 600,000 borrowers have received relief from that program. And it's still available. So many people moreso many more people can be helped. And I encourage you to apply, if you haven't already. You're still eligible. Go to studentaid.gov. It matters.
Third, my administration improved a program from the Obama-Biden administration on Income-Driven Repayment Plan. That's what it was referred to as. Back then, we set a limit: Student borrowers would pay no more than 10 percent of their disposable income to pay back their debt in any 1 monthtime.
My administration is going to reduce that to 5 percent. It's now the most generous repayment program ever. No one with an undergraduate loan today or in the future, whether from a community college or a 4-year college, will have to pay more than 5 percent of their disposable income to repay their loan. And that's income after you pay for the necessities, like housing, food, and the like.
The typical borrower is going to save about a thousand dollars a year. And if you keep up payments for 20 years without missing them, your total debt is forgiven after 20 years. That's what the program was before, but we've just reduced it 5 percent.
In addition to that, last year, I announced my student debt relief plan, a plan that was on the verge of providing more than 40 million Americans with real debt relief: up to $10,000 for many borrowers and up to $20,000 for those who had gotten a Pell grant. Nearly 90 percent of their relief would have gone to borrowers90 percent of itmaking less than $75,000 a year. And no oneno onemaking over $125,000 would qualify.
This program was all set to begin. The website had been set up. The applications had been simplified so that it took less than 5 minutes to complete. Notices had been sent out to people about the relief they were eligible for. Sixteen million people16 million peoplehad already been approved. The money was literally about to go out the door.
And then, Republican elected officials and special interests stepped in. They said no""no""literally snatching from the hands of millions of Americans thousands of dollars in student debt relief that was about to change their lives.
You know, these Republican officials just couldn't bear the thought of providing relief for working class and middle class Americans. Republican State officials sued my administration, attempting to block relief, including for millions of their own constituents. Republicans in Congress voted to overturn the plan. I think every one. I don't think I had any Republican votes for this plan.
At the same time, think about this: We all supported the Paycheck Protection Programremember?PPPyou know, which was designed to help businessowners who lost money because of the pandemic. It was a worthy program.
But let's be clear: Some of the same elected Republicans, Members of Congress who strongly opposed giving relief to students, got hundreds of thousands of dollars themselves in reliefMembers of Congressbecause of the businesses they were able to keep open.
Several Members of Congress got over a million dollars. All those loans were forgiven. You know how much that program cost? Seven hundred and sixty billion dollars. My program is too expensive? Three hundred and sixty billion dollars more than I proposed in my student debt relief program.
I was trying to provide students with $10- to $20,000 of relief. By comparison, the average amount forgiven in the PPPthe pandemic loan programaverage amount forgiven was $70,000.
Now, a kid making 60,000 bucks, trying to pay back his bills, asking for $10,000 in reliefcome on. The hypocrisy is stunning. You can't help a family making 75 grand a year, but you can help a millionaire and you have your debt forgiven?
My plan would not only have lifebeen life-changing for millions of Americans, it would have been good for the American economy. Freeing millions of Americans from the crushing burden of student debt, more homes would have been bought, more businesses would have been started, more couples would have had the confidence to start a family. Millions of people would have felt they could get on with their lives.
These Republicans blocked all that. Now, in addition to the hypocrisy, some of these Republicans in Congress are shamelessly pushing to advance a bill in the coming weeks that gives hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks and handouts to the wealthiest Americans. They still haven't given up on making permanent a $2 trillion tax cut that they never paid for. Never paid for. Two trillion dollars.
So let me be clear: For Republicans in Congress, this is not about reducing the deficit, it's not about fairness and forgiving loans, it's only about forgiving loans they have to pay. Today the Supreme Court sided with them. I believe the Court's decision to strike down my student debt relief program was a mistake, was wrong.
I'm not going to stop fighting to deliver borrowers what they need, particularly those at the bottom end of the economic scale. So we need to find a new way. And we're moving as fast as we can.
First, I'm announcing today a new path consistent with today's ruling to provide student debt relief to as many borrowers as possible as quickly as possible.
We will ground this new approach in a different law than my original plan, the so-called Higher Education Act. That will allow Secretary Cardona, who is with me today, to compromise, waive, or release loans under certain circumstances.
This new path is legally sound. It's going to take longer, but, in my view, it's the best path that remains to providing for as many borrowers as possible with debt relief.
I've directed my team to move as quickly as possible under the law. Just moments ago, Secretary Cardona took the first step to initially thatto initiate that new approach. We're not going to waste any time on this. We're getting moving on it. It's going to take longer, but we're getting at it right away.
Second, we know what many borrowers will need to make their hard choices, which their budgets are being strained nowwhen they start to repay their monthly loan payments this fall.
You know, we know that figuring out how to pay these added expenses can take time for borrowers, and they might miss payments at the front end as they get back into repayment.
Normally, this could lead some borrowers to fall into delinquency and default. But without their financialit would hurt their financial security, and that's not good for them or the economy. That's why we're creating a temporary, 12-month, what we're calling ""on-ramp"" repayment program.
Now, this is not the same as the student loan pause that's been in effect for the past 3 years. Monthly payments will be due, bills will not go out, and interest will be accruing. And during this period, if you can pay your monthly bills, you should.
But if you cannot, if you miss payments, this ""on-ramp"" will temporarily remove the threat of default or having your credit harmed, which can hurt borrowers for years to come, because the Department of Education won't refer borrowers. And the reason why that will work: They won't refer borrowers who have missed payments to credit agencies for 12 months to give them a chance to get back up and running.
Let me close with this: Our Republican officials say, ""Student loan relief is a giveaway to the privileged."" You hear that loud now: ""the privileged."" [Laughter] I love their concern for the privileged.
But I know who student loan borrowers are in this country, and so do all of you: They're the couple putting off having a child until they can find their way to deal with their debt. That's who they are. They're a youngputputting off buying their first home until they can get out from under their student loans.
Hope on the horizon thanks to the relief that I planned last year, today's Court decision snatched it away from them. I get it. I get it. I hear this. It'sand I'm concerned about it.
But today's decision has closed one path. Now we're going to pursue another. I'm never going to stop fighting for you. We'll use every tool at our disposal to get you the student debt relief you need and reach your dreams.
It's good for the economy. It's good for the country. It's going to be good for you.
Thank you very, very much for listening. We're going to get this done, God willing. Thank you.
Federal Student Loan Debt Relief Program 
Q. Mr. President, why did you give millions of borrowers false hope? You've dateddoubted your own authority here in the past.
The President. I didn't give any false hope. The question was whether or not I would do even more than was requested. What I did, I thought was appropriate and was able to be done and would get done. I didn't give borrowers false hope.
But the Republicans snatched away the hope that it wasthey were given. And it's realrealhope.
Thank you.
Q. Mr. President, will you cancel student debt?
U.S. Supreme Court/Presidential Authority 
Q. Mr. President, the Court said you overstepped your authority. Did you overstep your authority?
The President. I think the Court misinterpreted the Constitution.
Afghanistan 
Q. Mr. President, do you admit failure in Afghanistan? Mistakes? There was a report on the Afghanistan withdrawal, saying there was failure, mistakes. Do you admit there was mistakes during the withdrawal and before?
The President. No, no. All the evidence is coming back. Do you remember what I said about Afghanistan? I said Al Qaida would not be there. I said it wouldn't be there. I said we'd get help from the Taliban. What's happening now? What's going on? Read your press. I was right.
Thanks.
Q. So the report is from the State Department, actually, about the withdrawal.

2023-06-29 00:00:00,Remarks on the United States Supreme Court Decision on Affirmative Action in College Admissions and an Exchange With Reporters,"
The President. Good afternoon, folks. Sorry to keep you waiting a few minutes.
Forty-five yearsfor forty-five years, the United States Supreme Court has recognized a college's freedom to decide how to build diverse student bodies and to meet their responsibility of opening doors of opportunity for every single American.
In case after case, including recently, asjust as a few years ago in 2016, the Court has affirmed and reaffirmed this view: that colleges could use race not as a determinative factor for admission, but as one of the factors among many in deciding who to admit from a qualifiedalready qualified pool of applicants.
Today the Court once again walked away from decades of precedent and makeas the dissent has made clear. The dissent states that today's decision, quote, ""rolls back decades of precedent and momentous progress."" End of quote. I agree with that statement from the dissentsfrom the dissent.
The Court has effectively ended affirmative action in college admissions. And I stronglystronglydisagree with the Court's decision.
Because affirmative action is so misunderstood, I want to be clearmake sure everybody is clear about what the law has been and what it has not been, until today. Many people wrongly believe that affirmative action allows unqualified studentsunqualified studentsto be admitted ahead of qualified students. This is notthis is nothow college admissions work.
Rather, colleges set out standards for admission, and every studentevery studenthas to meet those standards. Then, and only then, after first meeting the qualifications required by the school, do colleges look at other factors in addition to their grades, such as race.
The way it works in practice is this: Colleges first establish a qualified pool of candidates based on meeting certain grade, test scores, and other criteria.
Then, and only thenthen, and only thenit is from this pool of applicants, all of whom have already met the school's standards, that the class is chosen, after weighing a wide range of factors, among them being race.
You know, I've always believed that one of the greatest strengths of Americaand you've tired of hearing me say itis our diversity, but I believe that. If you have any doubt about this, just look at the United States military, the finest fighting force in the history of the world. It's been a model of diversity. And it's not only been ourmade our Nation better, stronger, but safer.
And I believe the same is true for our schools. I've always believed that the promise of America is big enough for everyone to succeed and that every generation of Americans, we have benefited by opening the doors of opportunity just a little bit wider to include those who have been left behind.
I believe our colleges are stronger when they are racially diverse. Our Nation is stronger because we use what webecause we are tapping into the full range of talent in this Nation. I also believe that while talent, creativity, and hard work are everywhere across this country, not equal opportunity. It is not everywhere across this country.
We cannot let this decision be the last word. I want to emphasize: We cannot let this decision be the last word.
While the Court can render a decision, it cannot change what America stands for. America is an ideaan ideaunique in the world. An idea of hope and opportunity, of possibilities, of giving everyone a fair shot, of leaving no one behind. We've never fully lived up to it, but we've never walked away from it either. We will not walk away from it now.
We should never allow the country to walk away from the dream upon which it was founded: that opportunity is for everyone, not just a few. We need a new path forward, a path consistent with the law that protects diversity and expands opportunity.
So today I want to offer some guidance to our Nation's colleges as they review their admissions systems after today's decision, guidance that is consistent with today's decision.
They should not abandonlet me say this again: They should not abandon their commitment to ensure student bodies of diverse backgrounds and experience that reflect all of America.
What I propose for consideration is a new standard, where colleges take into account the adversity a student has overcome when selecting among qualified applicants.
Let's be clear: Under this new standard, just as was true under the earlier standard, students first have to be qualified applicants. They need the GPA and test scores to meet the school's standards.
Once that test is met, then adversity should be considered, including its lacka student's lack of financial means, because we know too few students of low-income families, whether in big cities or rural communities, are getting an opportunity to go to college.
When the poor kidwhen a poor kid, maybe the first in their family to go to college, gets the same grades and test scores as a wealthy kid whose whole family has gone to the most elite colleges in the country and whose path has been a lot easier, well, the kid who faced tougher challenges has demonstrated more grit, more determination. And that should be a factor that colleges should take into account in admissions. And many still do.
It also means examining where the student grew up and went to high school. It means understanding the particular hardships that each individual student has faced in life, including racial discrimination that individuals have faced in their own lives.
The Court says, quote, ""[N]othing in this opinion should be construed as prohibiting universities from considering an application's [applicant's; White House correction] discussion of how race has affected his or her life,"" but it'sit's throughbut ""be it through discrimination or inspiration or otherwise."" End of quote.
Because the truth iswe all know it: Discrimination still exists in America. Discrimination still exists in America. Discrimination still exists in America. Today's decision does not change that. It's a simple fact.
If a student has overcomehad to overcome adversity on their path to education, a college should recognize and value that. Our Nation's colleges and universities should be engines of expanding opportunity through upward mobility. But today, too often that's not the case.
The statisticsone statistic: Students from the top 1 percent of family incomes in America are 77 times more likely to get into an elite college than one from the bottom 20 percent of family incomes. Seventy-seven percent greater opportunity.
Today, for too many schools, the only people who benefit from the system are the wealthy and the well connected. The odds have been stacked against working people for much too long. We need a higher education system that works for everyone, from Appalachia to Atlanta and to far beyond. We can and must do better, and we will.
Today I'm directing the Department of Education to analyze what practices help build a more inclusive and diverse student bodies and what practices hold that back, practices like legacy admissions and other systems that expand privilege instead of opportunity.
Colleges and universities should continue their commitment to support, retain, and graduate diverse students and classes. You know, and companiescompanies who are already realizing the value in diversity should not use this decision as an excuse to turn away from diversity either.
We can't go backwards.
You know, I know today's Court decision is a severe disappointment to so many people, including me, but we cannot let the decision be a permanent setback for the country. We need to keep an open door of opportunities. We need to remember that diversity is our strength. We have to find a way forward.
We need to remember that the promise of America is big enough for everyone to succeed. You know, that's the work of my administration, and I'm always going to fight for that.
And I want to thank you all. And I know you've been told I have a helicopter out there waiting to go up to do an interview in New York. I'll be talking tomore about this in a live interview.
But thank you very much. And we're going to have plenty of time to talk about this. But we're not going to let this break us.
Thank you.

Joseph R. Biden, Remarks on the United States Supreme Court Decision on Affirmative Action in College Admissions and an Exchange With Reporters Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/363474 "
2023-06-29 00:00:00,Remarks at a Campaign Reception in New York City,"
Thank you. Thanks. Thank you very much. I'm not the essential man, but I represent the essential companycountry.
You know, remember Madeleine Albright talked about America being the essential country, theAmerica having to lead the world? I spent a lot of my time in foreign policy as a Senator and then as Vice President. And she was more right than I thought she wasthat, you know, when I walk into a room, it's not Joe Biden walking into a room. It's the United States of America walking into a room.
And it hasno, I mean this sincerely. It surprised me how the rest of the world, in particular our alliesand not even our allieslook at the United States. They look at it like: We're in the house.
By the way, I've got to tell you, I had lunch with Barack the other day. And I was kidding him; I said, ""Every time I hear""he's helping out a lotI said, ""Every time I hear 'Hail to the Chief,' I turn around and look for you, wondering where the hell you are."" [Laughter] No, you think I'm kidding. I'm not. Secret Service looks at me sometimes like: ""That's you. Come on out."" [Laughter]
But, folks, there'sthere's so much at stake. And I want to start by sayingit's not hyperboleyou're the reason why I've been able to get anything done on climate. Not a joke. Not a joke. You've held the country together in ways that we were ready to walk
The first thing I did when I got elected was rejoin the Paris accord. First act we'vewe took. And the impact it had on other nations was like, ""Whoa."" Not ""Joe Biden is back."" ""America's back in the deal.""
But you all have invested so much of your fortune, so much of yourof thisof the foundation you have in making sure that everybody understands this is the existential threat to humanity. It is the existential threat. Not a joke. 1.5 degrees Celsius, 19205. We're in trouble if we get itI mean, we're in real trouble. It's not going to turn thisfor example, I was telling a couple of you earlier in the rope lineI'm sorry I spent so much time talking in the rope line, holding people up.
But you know, I was talking about how 2 years nowit'll be 3 years this ChristmasI was in Geneva trying to work out something with Putin, before he invaded Ukraine, on space-based weapons and trying to get a new negotiation going.
And he saidand I said: ""There's a lot we can work on. We can work on climate."" He said, ""We don't have a problem with""he essentially said, ""We don't have a problem with climate in Russia."" I said: ""You've got eight time zones. The permafrost along thealong the Arctic Circle is melting. More methane is coming out of there than anywhere in the world. And guess what? It's not going to refreeze. You've got a real problem.""
The point is that just getting people to realize thatwhat is at stake. And you've done it.
And you've done itthe reason I'm standing here is in large part because of you all. Not a joke. I'm not being solicitous. I got a lot of help. I got a lot of help to get electeda lot of people. But no group of people have been more engaged with me in terms of providing me the means and the judgment and the insight, like we were talking about what you're about to do.
I mean, itthere's just enormous possibilities, and I'm optimistic. I'm genuinely optimistic.
I just want to tick off a few things, and then I'll go to questions, because I don't want to take too much time talking about things you may not be interested in.
You know, first of all, you know, Iwhen I saidwhen I ran, I said I wanted toI was running for three reasons. One, to restore the soul of this country. By that, I mean the value system we had, the decency, honor. I mean, think of the way we talk aboutto each other now. I mean, it's embarrassing, in front of our children and our grandchildren. Not ""we""the public dialogue. The things that are said. I mean, the language used. It's justit justit's degrading. And the rest of the world looks at us and goes, ""Whoa, what's going on?""
The first meeting I had after I becameelected President, I went tothe G-7 was meeting inoutside of London, along the coast. And I sat down. And with the press here, I'm not going to say who the people were. But I sat down with the other major leaders of NATO and Europe. And whenI said, ""America is back."" And one of the leadingCEOnot CEOsPresidents of a country looked at me, and he said: ""For how long? For how long?"" Not a joke.
And I looked at him. And before I could answer, another leader from one of the major four countries in the world looked to me and said: ""Mr. President, what would you say if tomorrow we picked up the London Times and you've read that there was a circumstance where a thousand people broke down the doors of the House of Commons, killed two bobbies, and went in and tried to stop the election of a Prime Minister? What would you think?"" And it made me realize how profound what's happening here in the United States is to the rest of the world, how theand whatwhat would we think? What the hell would we think?
And so one of the things that I was able toI don't want to say ""I""we were able to do was up the ante on climate across the board from all thesewith all these countries and increase the number of countries participating.
Matter of fact, I have aI don't want to get her in troublebut a granddaughter working on this full timeworking for one of the major institutions, traveling the world dealing with the G-7these meetings on climate.
And there is an awakening. Let me put it this way: Since I got elected President, I've been in more helicopter rides with Governors from around the countryfrom Arizona, New Mexico, up to Washington State, to Idaho, all the way into Montana and down intoand moremore timber has burned to the ground because of climate change, because of theof the winds and the storms knocking down high-tension wires and many other things, than makes up the entire square feet of the State of Maryland. That's how much has burned to the groundto the ground.
And so, you know, all of a sudden, when you look out here and you can barely see a building across the lakeyou know, sometimes it's going topeople are beginning tothere's no longer a debate, ""Is there global warming?"" ""Is there global warming?""
There's a selfishness saying, ""I don'tnotwithstanding global warming, we still want to pollute.""
I mean, take a look at Texas. Texas has the highest percentageI think it still doesof wind and solar. I think it mayI won'tI won'tI don't want to misstate, but a significant percentage of their energy is produced by wind and solar. But guess what? The Governor is trying to cut it back because the oil industry doesn't like it.
I meananyway. So I want to just quickly list the things we've been working on and then talk about whatever you want to talk about.
First of all, when I ran, I said we canyou know, we can get bipartisan things done. The press understandably said: ""You used to be able to do that, Joe. You were known for that.""
George Mitchell's friend is here. And George mayhe gave me an award when I was a Senator, saying I got more done because I could have relations across the aisle with people and get things done. But they were the good old days. That's gone.
Yet we were able to get some bipartisan things done. Not with a big number, but just enough Republicans to join us. Some, we had to do it all ourselves.
But as I said, in addition to rejoining the Paris climate treaty, we passed the Inflation Reform [Reduction; White House correction] Act, the largest investment in the history of the world: $369 billion for climate$369 billion. And remember they got mad I didn't get $500 billion?
Well, it cuts pollution by 1 billion tons, cuts emissions by 50 percent by 2030, andand tax credits for EVs, solar, wind, and batteries, heat pumps, hydrogen. A lot of newand there's a lot of research going on. A lot of you are funding the research. There are so many possibilities we have.
We passed the infrastructure law with 500,000 EV chargers. And they're going to500,000. They canand guess what? It's going to create awe're capping 100,000 wells in the United States100,000.
Remember all the heat about what was going on in West Virginia andand southwestWestern Pennsylvania? Well, these same guys who dug those wellsguess what?they're getting paid to cap them. And it's working.
And we're rebuilding. And we're putting a new environmental plant where that old steel plant used to be inin Wharton, West Virginia.
Fuel economy rules. We cut emissions in half by 30by 2032.
Brought unionsenvirosand enviros together. Did you ever think that would happen?
But I know some of you got worried about me afterwhenabout 2 months, when I hadn't announced my environmental stuff. You're calling, ""Joe, what the hell is going on?"" I said, ""I'm meeting with the union guys."" Becauseno, I'm serious, because I was convinced that if they knew what was coming, their future lay with the environmental issues. That's how itand by the way, the IBEW was the first one to stand up when I said: ""Hey, look, what are you doing? You'reyou're going to be out of work. You're notyou're going to have trouble.""
But guess what? And we alsoa couple of you were down on the South Lawn when I had all the automobile manufacturers together.
I remember the General Motors chairman hadwas suing the State of California for having a higher standard than the Federal standards, saying that was unconstitutional and you couldn't have a higher standard. Well, guess what? A week and a half later, I got a call. She said: ""I'm dropping the suit in California, and I'm going to go all electric. All electric.""
And we startedand everybody started that route. And it worked. It's beginning to work. I mean, it's not finished yet by a long shot. But the point is, it's working. It's moving. And guess what? They all of a sudden figured out that's going to create all these jobs for them.
And by the way, these EV stations are going to betheseyou know, all across America. Electric vehiclesthey're going tothey're going to put in 500,000 of these across the country. So you can get in your car, your electric vehicle, and go, just like an old gas station.
And thatand it's generating thousands of jobs. It will generate thousands more jobs in those communities. When you have awhen youwhen they were building gas stations originally, no one wanted one in their neighborhood because they had thousand-gallon tanks inback in the twenties and thirties.
Guess what? What happens when you build a gas station? You end up building a drugstore. You end up building a hotdog stand. I mean, it generates economic growth. And a lot ofand a lot of communities have been left behind big time andbecause of whatshipping jobs overseas andanyway.
So the third thing isthe last thing is that solar panel manufacturing is up eight times. Youa lot of you funded it. Solar energy and wind energy is nownow cheapercheapercheaper than fossil fuels. Cheaper tonoand by the way, no one is going to bid on a coal-fired plant again. You know why? It's notit makes no sense. Economically makes no sense anymore.
The biggest problem we hadand I need your help on this continuallyis when I went up inI guess it was Rhode Islandclosing down the largest coal-fired plant in the country. Because what we found out wasand with the help of a lot of my staffand they are good staff and environmentally conscious and smartis that wewhen Barack and I came up with the economic plan onon the environment and energy and electric and dealing with wind and solar, we thought we could transmit it on the high power lines.
Well, not in my neighborhood. Even people that lived in your neighborhood didn't like it, and whether it was inout in thesound or wherever it was, becauseand Trump didn't like it because it killedit ""caused cancer.""
[At this point, the President made the sign of the cross.]
[Laughter] But all kidding aside, think about it. Think about what has happened since then. We figured out that if you close down those plants, you don't take down high-tension wires, you put the windyou connect the wind or the solar to that facility.
Soand now what you'rea lot of you are helping doing: If we put these wires underground, it makes ait costs six times as much, but it also is environmentally a hell of a lot more sound. Costs more. We're trying to figure out how to fund that as well.
But the point is, we're making significant progress. And theand the EV sales are three timesup three times. And we've conservedI announced when I got electedand I'll stop with thisthat my goal was to conserve 30 percent of all the land and all the waters within the jurisdiction of the United States of America and to do that by 2035excuse meby 2030.
So far, we're on our way. Now, we've got more to do in Alaska, and I need your help there. But we've25 million acres is now in conservation in Alaska. Spirit Mountain, 500,000 acres500,000 acres. The Pacific Islands, I'm going towe're going to make sure that 770,000 square miles around Hawaii, off limits. Cut back on drilling in many places.
But the generic point is: There's a lot going on, and a lot going on in hydrogen. A lot going on in other alternatives. And it's because of you guys. And I'm not being solicitous. It really genuinely is.
You think itI know you don't like to think about this way, but think if you all dropped out. Where the hell would we be? Not a joke.
You're funding the private enterprises you do in terms of environment, as well as making sure that you not only elect somebody like me, who cares about the environment, but a Congressa Congressa Congress. I need the Congress. I need the Senate. And we're going to do it. We're going to win back the House with your help. And we're going toit's going to be hard to keep it in the Senate, but we're going to do that as well.
So I'm going on too much. I apologize. But there's an enormousenormousenormousand the one reason why I am so optimistic is because of the people between the ages of 17 and 30. They get it. They understand. They are the impetusthe political impetus: the kids, the young people, the young voters.
I go into a grade school or high school; what do they want to talk about? The environment. They get it. They get it.
So there's a lota lotwe can do, and I'm optimistic we're going to continue to do it with your help.
I'm going to hush up, as my mother would say, and take any questions you have.

Joseph R. Biden, Remarks at a Campaign Reception in New York City Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/363475 "
2023-06-29 00:00:00,Remarks at a Campaign Reception in New York City,"
The President. Governor, you should go home. [Laughter]
Governor Kathleen C. Hochul of New York. I love listening to[inaudible].
The President. This is what we call a busman's holiday for your Governor. [Laughter]
And I want to thank you all very much. Blair, thank you. Andand, Roger, you guys, and Jon and Peter and Devenyou know, you've been ayou're the only reason I'm standing here, and that's not hyperbole.
These guys came along in twentytwo thousand andin 2020, when we were running and we had hit the bottom. Things didn't look very well, as Roger I think pointed out to me just before South Carolina. [Laughter] And everything was looking bleak. And without even asking, you guys stepped up, and you saved me. You really did.
And Ione thing I wanted to say publicly with the press here is, it wasn't just the contributions; it was your stature. The fact that men and women of your stature stood up and vouched for me, it mattered. I mean, Iyou all are used to helping people. You're used to helping political people who you think make a difference.
But I think you underestimate how much your personal status in the community means. You give credibility. And so I want to thank you for that. Ifrom the bottom my heart. And that's not hyperbole. I would not be standing here if you guys didn't volunteer. Without my even asking, you stepped up. So thank you, thank you, thank you.
And, Governor HochulKathy, this is ait's an honor to be with you. You've done a hell of a job. And being the Governor of New York is not an easy thing. But it's a big, beautiful State.
I think it's one of the mostI think it's the single most underestimated State in the Nation. It has the most beautifulparts of this State areI mean, it's incredible. And that comes from a guy who married a woman from the Finger Lakes and Lake Skaneateles.
But the point is that you've done a great job. And I want toI appreciateand I know that we've tried to work on some things together. We've done a lot together. But also, we're in a situation where the good Governor of Florida and Texas have not been the best friends of New York for a long time, and we're trying like hell to continue to help.
By the way, the number crossing the border is down significantly, from close to 80,000 to 3,500. And we'reI think we'rewith the grace of God, the good will of neighbors, and the crick not risingas my father would saywe're going to beand by the way, you know, I have a lot of assets to this campaign, but none that are more consequential than Jeffrey Katzenberg. Jeffrey, thank you. Jeffrey has beencome along, and he's a cochair of my campaign. And he comes fromhe comes from the West Coast to these things. You know what I mean?
Anyway, Iand I'm proud to call everyone herein here that's sponsoring this a friend. And I mean it.
And look, you were with us when the thingswhen the pundits said we were counted out. And I want you to know, again, I'll never forget what you did for me. I would not be here without you. And I don't think thatIin our private conversations when I got here initially, I mean, just a couple hoursan hour or so ago, is that this is a critical election, not because I'm running, because what's at stake. There's so much at stake. And the alternative is a little bit scary. I'm not being facetious.
I mean, the lackdid you ever think we'd be talking about banning books in America? Did you ever think we'd be talking about back in thelike the days in thein the last century, we were talking about cutting voting rights, about making suregerrymandering the districts in ways that wereI mean, it just
And the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court is becoming not just conservative, but almostit's like a throwback. It's like a throwback, some of the decisions they're making.
You know, did you ever think we'd be in a position, after 50 years of acknowledging the right of privacy in the Constitution, suggesting that therethere's no such thing as the right to privacy? Did you ever think we'd be having arguments about whether or not contraception was legitimatecould be outlawed by States? I meanI mean, it's like we're in a different world almost.
But I think thatI have faith, because I really think the vast majority of the American people are decent, honorable, and good, and they just have to get the facts. They have to get the facts. And that's one of the things that you're lookingI'm looking forward to you relying on me to be able to do.
And look, because we've got a story to tell and a record to run on, I think with a little bit of help, we can do well this time out. I think thatyou know, yesterday I talked to Chicago about what the pressnotIand Iit wasn't necessarily meant to be so complimentary, but Bidenomics, by theyou know, the Economist and the Wall Street Journal, et cetera. And I'm not criticizing it. You know, they justbut I come from a circumstance where I think that the best thing we can do for American growth, and we havewhen we win the mostwhen we've been the most secure and powerful is when the middle class was able to participate. When we still had very wealthy people like all of you leading the way in many ways, but trickle-down economics never landed much on my dad's kitchen table.
And so we found ourselves in a situation where the excesses of that program, of that notion, were seen last time around: a $2 trillion tax cut and not a penny paid for; greater increase in the debt than anybody inanybody. And you know, 40-percent increase. I mean, things that wea tax system that isI mean, it's just notit's just not fair. It'sI don't know many people who think it's fair.
And I'm not looking for 60- or 80-percent taxes for wealthy people. We're not going back there. But just everybody pay their fair share.
I'm a capitalist. If you can make a million dollars, a billion dollars, that's fine by me. Just participate. And you all do. You all do.
But you know, we havewe've gone fromin America from having 750 billionaires 4 years ago toto now a thousand, average tax rate 8 percent. That's less thanthat's less than a cop pays, a firefighter, you know, someone running a childcare center.
And so one of the things that I've done is that I've decided that you've got tothe best way to build a country isand Bidenomics wasn't meant as necessarily a compliment at the timeis to let people know what I believe. I think it's a different value set: that is to build this country from the middle out and the bottom up. The poor have a shot when that happens. The middle class does well. We all do well. And the wealthy don't get punished at all; they still do very well. And so I think that's what's starting thispeople are beginning to seeto see that again.
And you know, yesterday, as I said, I talked in Chicago about making investments in America, educating and empowering our people, promoting competition.
You know, I met with some of you who are a part of the Business Roundtable. I met with the Business Roundtable, and Ithey're asking me why I was talking so much aboutabout education andand funding of preschool and all that kind of thing. And I said, you know, when the formerthe Governor of Illinoishis sister was Secretary of Commerce, Barack asked us to meetand I think you may remember thiswithI think we met with either in Zoom or in person with 400or 350don't hold me to the exact numberover 350 CEOs of the Fortune 500 companies.
And we asked them, ""What do you need most?"" They said, ""A better educated public, a better educated workforce."" And I said, ""You know, I come from the State of corporate America, more of you are incorporated in my State than every other State in the Union combined."" And I said, ""Back when I ran the first time and got elected as a 29-year-old kid in 1972 to the Senate, the DuPont company was the eighth largest corporation in America."" It's no longer, but it was. And I said, ""When they'dwhen they'd expand and buy a new enterprise, they'd educate theirthey'd educate their workforce."" I said: ""You guys don't do that anymore. So why the hell are you taking me on when I'm trying to get a better educated public?"" And it changed. People started supporting it.
But my generic point is that there isthere'sI think there's beginning to be a bit of a sea change. You know, the idea that we were able towhen I ran, I said I wanted toI wanted to bring backrestore the soul of America. That wasn't hyperbole. It was to try to bring back a sense of decency and honor in the way we talk to one another, the way we conduct policy.
You know, theI just came from a function in town here. And George Mitchell'sI think it was his nieceand George Mitchell waswas the Senate Majority Leader. And hewhenanyway, he was very generous in the caucus in saying that Biden was able to get things done better than anybody else since Kennedy because I had relations with the other side of the aisle.
And I did. We used to argue like hell. John McCain and I would scream at each other, but we were like brothers. We'd make up at the end, and we worked together when we agreed on things. You remember these conversations.
And I saidand they said: ""Well, that was the old days. Biden doesn't realize that all's changed. You can't do that anymore.""
So what I said was I wanted toI wanted to bring back some bipartisanship. With your help, guess what? We passed more major legislation than anybodyI'm told by Jon Meacham and othersmore than any other President since Franklin Roosevelt, major pieces of legislation. And it was withand about half of it was bipartisan. Bipartisan. Not a lotbecause this is not your father's Republican Party. This is a different breed of cat. But there's still a lot of really honorable, decent Republican Senators and Congressmen. They're mildly intimidated by some of the MAGA-right folks in the new Republican Party.
But the point is, we got a lot done. Andfor example, the end result was that we're makingby empowering and educating our people, promoting competition. It's working. Thirteen million jobs created. We inherited a mess. Inflation less than half of what it was just a year ago; $490 billion foreign$490 billion in private investment in the economy in the United States of America.
Remember the talk was, at the time, ""Biden is trying to establish industrial policy""? We did a survey. Don't ask me how many folks they askedmy staff. But went out and asked and said, ""Are you more or less inclined to make major investments in the economy if the Government is investing?"" And it was like 80 percent more. And guess what? It's working.
That's why I went out and did the CHIPSyou know, when Iwe worked on the legislation relating to semiconductors. We invented those suckers, man. Smaller than the end of my little fingertip. We were sophisticated. We're the ones that did it. And guess what? We used to have 40 percent of the market. Now we have less than 10 percent of the market.
And so I went around saying there was a way to come to the United States and invest: $300 billion that's beginning to be invested right nowSyracuse, New York, up in Poughkeepsie and those areanot Poughkeepsie.
Audience member. In both.
The President. Both.
Audience member. [Inaudible]and IBM.
The President. And, I mean, they're investing a great deal. You know, Ithe first major initiative was Intel, outside of Cleveland, Ohio. A thousand acres that are being developed. I started callingwell, Iit was spontaneous. Imaybe people thought I had a plan. I said it's the ""field of dreams."" These guys are building two fabstwo factoriesthat are bigger than football fields, each of them; going to applyemploy 5,000 people. And guess what? Seven thousand people building them on prevailing wage. A lot of growth in the region just for that. But those folks, the vast majority of those jobs are more than 1,000100,000 bucks a year, up to 130 grand a year. And you don't need a college degree.
All of a sudden, those blue-collar workers realize, ""Son of a gun."" And think ofyou guys invest in education in your communities. How manyhow many high schools have shop anymore? How many high schools have anything where people know whether they want to work with their hands? It's not happening.
But now, across America, we're going to be rebuilding factories. And by the way, through the heartland of America a lot of this is happening.
By the way, there was ayou know, when we did thethe IRA, thewe're talking about having the internet connected to your home. Well, guess what? In suburban and rural areas, it doesn't happen.
Well, thethe former football coach from Alabama, who was a better coach than he's a Senator, in my view[laughter]announcedhe said, ""Isn't it wonderful""and the press will remember the number; I don't""a billion 400 million dollars or two billion dollars coming tocoming into Alabama, and we're going to have the best Internet system in the world."" Going on and on. He voted against it. So I'm going to be down there for the groundbreaking. [Laughter]
You know, or we have a major, major, major environmental project going up in the gentlelady from Georgia's district. She'sshe voted against everything, wants to impeach me. But she said this is greatest thing that happened to her area, inI think it's Decatur; I'm not sure exactly what town.
But my generic point is that this makes a big difference. And it's giving people an opportunity. Look, you know, in the old days, how many blue-collar white guys didn't vote Democrat? Well, nobody, because wein my view, we didn't seem to take them seriously anymore. Weyou know, it was like, you know, what are we talking about?
Well, it's changing. And it's changing because of the business community. The business community is changing, as well.
And so I guess what I'm saying is that we're in a situation where there's so much more we can do. We have to finish the job, because a lot of peoplethey support everything we've done, when they poll on it, but they don't know who did it. They don't know how it got done. And there's a reason I haven't beenthe press is asking me, legitimately, why am I now just going around the country. Because they're just kicking in now, theyjust so they could see what's happening.
For example, the Hudsongoing under the Hudsonthe tunnel, Amtrak through theunder the Hudson. Well, guess what? That's a billion-dollar project. It's going to generate a lot of work, a lot of income. And guess what? You're going to have trains going through there at 110 miles an hour instead of having to stop. It's fundamentally a gigantic change andhow can you be the strongest nation in the world economically and have a second rate infrastructure, ranked, I think, number 13 in the world? How can that happen? It's not possible.
And so we're making the kind of investments you all have been supportive of. And when we were really, really economically moving, it was working. Again, 13 million new jobs, 800,000 manufacturing jobs.
And you know what that's doing, with all the other investments we're talking about? We also have reduced the budget forby helping people. Medicareand I hope none of you are in pharma, but if you are, you're going to be mad at me.
I've been fighting pharma since I was a Senator in my second term. Only outfit in the world we can't negotiate with, up to now.
Wepharma, we were able to negotiate the price of drugs and medicine andfor thefrom thefrom thedealing with thethe military costs that we have and what the military pays. Well, we can't do it for anything else.
Well, look, you know, we talk aboutwe have to deal with inflation still. And I know you guys and women know a great deal about the economy. I get it. But I've been hearing since I got elected, ""Within the next month, there's going to be a recession."" I've been hearing that all along. Pray to God
[At this point, the President knocked on the podium.]
it continues to be wrong, because we have such a strong base.
You know, theythey reassessed the growth of the GDP the first quarter: 2 percent2 percent. I go down the list in all the things that has economically changed. And theand we'reand I knowand I have to admit it bothers me when we talk about the way to get inflation under control is fire people, have fewer employees. We've got to figure out a way.
Any rate, the point I'm making is that the guy who inventedI mean, how many of you know somebody who needs insulin forfor theirfor what they're dealing with in terms of the need to be able to continue to live. And so, you know, how many of you know peopleanyway, I won't get into it all.
But the bottom line is, the guy who inventedinvented insulin said he didn't patent it because he wanted it available for everybodyavailable for everybody. Do you know how much it costs to make? Ten buckst-e-nt-e-n dollars. Package it, it's $13.
If I'm going to have you have to deal with that issue andas a family, and you want to purchase the insulin because you have children and need it or whatever, ityou have to pay about 400 bucks a month.
Now, pharma is notthey're not bad guys. But guess what? Whatever drug you need, if it's made here in the United States by a major pharmaceutical company and sold in New York State, you can buy it cheaper in Toronto, Paris. You canLondon, Madrid, all around the world, significantly cheaper.
And that's stopping on my watch. That's stopping. So we got something passed that now Medicare can negotiate drug prices.
And as I waswhen I wasthis is going sound self-servingbut when we were able to work out the threat of closing down the GovernmentI mean, of reneging on our debtwe worked it out. They wanted to eliminatethe other team wanted to eliminate everything we passed. Not a joke. Every major initiative, they wanted to eliminate.
And the most interesting conversation I had with the Speaker and others was I said, ""Well, you got to count how we deal with reducing the debt."" I'm the only President that's ever reduced the debt in 2 years $1.7 trillion$1.7 trillionand still did all these programs.
You know why? Well, you know, the Fortune 500or 55 companies who were paid 40they made $40 billion, didn't pay a penny. We said, ""You've got to pay a minimum tax of 15 percent."" Guess what? It paid for it all. People started paying their way.
And so I said, ""You realize how much we're going save the Governmentnot just peoplethe Government and the deficit by the passage of this legislation on insulin: $168 billion deficit reduction."" That's what it is.
So I guess what I'm trying to say here is that when you talk about that, the Inflation Reduction Act, the CHIPS Act, dealing with the bipartisan gun safetywe passed the gunwe've got more to do as a Government. I talk about it all the time. We passed the most extensive gun safety law in 30 years.
I'm the guy who, back when I was a Senator, along with Dianne Feinstein, outlawed assault weapons. We got that done and a number ofof bullets could be in a carbinethat you could have in yourbe able to be fired.
Who the hell needs 100 rounds in ain a weapon? Who ever needs 25 rounds?
When I was selling this as a Senator, we have bigwe have a lot of gun ownership in Delaware because of the Eastern Shore, a lot of duck hunting, a lot ofand I'mI used to walk through in hip boots talking to people who were in there to make the case. And I'm in there and the guy is fishing, and he said: ""You're taking my damn gun, Joe. What are you doing now?"" And I saidI said: ""Let me tell you: How many deer you know are wearing a Kevlar vest?"" [Laughter] ""And if you need more than eight rounds to kill a bear, man, you're in trouble. You're a lousy shot."" [Laughter] And he looked at me, and he said, ""Son of a bitch, you make a good point."" [Laughter]
But we could only get it done for 10 years then, but we've got to get back again. We have to eliminate assault weapons and limit the rounds. Too many people are dyingand not just these celebrated cases you see. Every day in neighborhoods in this city, every day in neighborhoods across America, there's a mass shooting. Every day. And we can change it.
In terms of additional things, weyou know, wewell, I'm going toI've gone on too long. I apologize.
The idea that we have taken 50 years of Supreme Court decisions based on theoriesand this is including the Federalist Society and others50 years, Roe v. Wade. Since when is it decided there was no right of privacy in the Constitution? This Court overruled 55 years of precedent, saying, ""There is no right."" It's the old far-right position that unless it's mentioned in the Constitution, it doesn't exist.
And guess what that put it in jeopardy? Did you ever think we'd be having debate of whether contraception was available, legal, can be sold over the counter? I mean, thewe're the United States of America. Did you think that would happen? Well, guess what? If you leave it to the States to make a decision, and it's no longer a constitutional right, but the States decide these things, what happens?
And that's whyI'm going to get myself in trouble here, butand I'll end with this: That's why you've got to help Kathy elect a Democratic Senate hereI mean, excuse me, a Democratic House of Representatives. We can win back five seats here, and I need it badly. I need you to help them. And you can help run some of her househer senateher househer State legislative senate and house seats.
But look, you know, it'sI guess what I want to say is that there is a lot we have to do. And one of the things we can do is deal with the issue of whatletting people know that what's happened and what's changing their circumstances is because of things we've done. And they don't know that part yet. And that's a big thing where you're being able to help me fund this next 16 months, to let people know what and why these things are happening.
I'm talking too much. I'm going to hush up and take your questions. So thank you.

2023-06-28 00:00:00,"Remarks on the National Economy in Chicago, Illinois","
Hello, hello, hello. Thank you all very much.
And, Bob, thank you for that introduction. Bob has been helping me for a long time. I guess he doesn't know any better.
And speaking of help from a long time, a brandnew guy in town, a guy whoI told him that being mayor, I think, is the toughest job in America. They know where you live, and every time you walk in the grocery store, you get questions. But congratulations, Mr. Mayor. And I think that you've been doing a good job. [Applause] Mayor Brandon Johnson.
Look, you know, there's a guy that helped me more thanI can say this without equivocationhelped me more than anybody in America get elected last time. A single person: your Governor. He stepped up. He raised money. He raised support. Governor, you're the best. Thank you for being such a good friend. No, I really mean it.
And I like hanging around with heroines like Tammy Duckworth. Tammy, God love you. You're the best too, I tell you.
But you know what? My good friend Dick Durbinand he is a good friend; we've worked together a long, long time in the United States Senatehe's the single most effective Senator in getting things done. And that's not a joke. It's not just Judiciary Committee.
He's made sure that we got more judges appointedwe've appointed more African American women to theto the Federal bench than any otherevery other President combined. And he got the first and brightest Justice Ketanji Brown. He gotI said I was going to put a Black woman on the Court, and he put her on the Court for me. He put her on the Court for me.
Dick, you really are the best, man. And by the way, when I have questions aboutjust about anyanything at all beyond the Judiciary Committee, I still call him anyway for his advice. So thank you.
And Representative Danny Davis. Danny, you've been a good friend for a long time. He's always there.
And to all the elected officialsMember of Congress, elected officials here today: Thank you. Thank you for the welcome and welcoming me to Chicago.
You know, in the first quarter of the 20th century, the poet Carl Sandburg described Chicago as a ""city of big shoulders."" A ""city of big shoulders."" He was describing the ""big shoulders"" of the working class American town wherewho were building this city, at the same time building the middle class.
I'm here in Chicago today, for the first quarter of the 21st century, to talk about the economic vision for this country: the economy that grows the economy from the middle out and the bottom up instead of just the top down. When that happens, everybody does well. The wealthy still doeverybody does well. The poor have a ladder up, and the wealthy still do well. We all do well.
This vision is a fundamental break from the economic theory that has failed America's middle class for decades now. It's called trickle-down economicsfundamental economics, trickle-down. The idea wasit's the belief that we should cut taxes for the wealthy and big corporationsand I know something about big corporations; there's more corporations in Delaware incorporated than every other State in the Union combined. I want them to do well, but I'm tired of waiting for the trickle-down. It doesn't come very quickly. Not much trickled down on my dad's kitchen table growing up.
And it's a belief that we should shrink public investment in infrastructure and public educationshrink it; that we should let good jobs get shipped overseas. And we actually have a tax policy that encourages them to go overseas to save money. We should let big corporations amass more power while making it harder to join a union.
I meant what I said when I said I'm going to be the prothe most pro-union President in American history. And I make no apologies for it.
My predecessorif my mom were here, ""and God bless his soul""my predecessor enacted the latest iteration of a failedthe failed theory. Tax cuts for the wealthy. It wasn't paid for, and the estimated cost of his tax cut was $2 trillion. Two trillion dollars.
Now Republicans are at it again, pushing for tax cuts for large corporations and the wealthy and adding trillions of dollars to the deficit. Trillions.
Folks, let me say this as clearly as I can: The trickle-down approach failed the middle class. It failed America. It blew up the deficit. It increased inequity. And it weakened theour infrastructure. It stripped the dignity, pride, and hope out of communities one after another, particularly through the Midwest, Western Pennsylvania, and heading west.
People working as hard as ever couldn't get ahead because it's harder to buy a home, pay for a college education, start a business, retire with dignity. The first time in a generation, the path of the middle class seemed out of reach. And I don't think it's hyperbole; I think it's a fact, no matter whether you're a Democrat, Republican, or an Independent.
I knew we couldn't go back to the same failed policies when I ran, so I came into office determined to change the economic direction of this country, to move from trickle-down economics to what everyone in the Wall Street Journal and Financial Times began to call ""Bidenomics."" I didn't come up with the name. [Laughter] I really didn't. I now claim it, but they're the ones that used it first.
I got asked by a press person this morning, getting on the helicopter in Washington, why""When I asked you about Bidenomics a long time ago, you said you didn't know what it was."" I said: ""I didn't name it Bidenomics. I didn't realize the economists in the Wall Street Journal did."" But I think it's a plan that I'llI'm happy to call it ""Bidenomics."" [Laughter]
And guess what? Bidenomics is working. When I took office, the pandemic was raging and our economy was reeling, supply chains were broken, millions of people unemployed, hundreds of thousands of small businesses on the verge of closing after so many had already closedliterally, hundreds of thousands on the verge of closing.
Today, the U.S. has had the highest economic growth rate, leading the world economies since the pandemic. The highest in the world. As Dick said, with his help, we created 13.4 million new jobs, more jobs in 2 years than any President has ever[applause]made in 4in 2.
And, folks, it's no accident. That's Bidenomics in action. Bidenomics is about building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down. And there are three fundamental changes that we decided to make with the help of Congress and have been able to do it: first, making smart investments in America; second, educating and empowering American workers to grow the middle class; and third, promoting competition to lower costs to help small businesses.
Here's what I mean by all this. Under trickle-down economics, it didn't matter whether you made things, as long as you helped the company's bottom line, even if that meant seeing jobs and industries go overseas for cheaper labor. Supply chains and key products moved overseas, like China and much of Asia. The entire towns and communities, from where I lived all the way out there and through the Midwest, were shut down, hollowed out. I mean literally hollowed out.
All over the country, parents have to say to theirand many of you and all elected officials heard people tell you thishad to say to their children: ""Honey, I lost my job. We can't live here anymore. We've got to move.""
Trickle-down also meant slashing public investment on things that helped drive long-term growth and helped America lead the world in innovation. We used to invest 2 percent of our gross domestic product in research and development. By the time I came to office, that was down to .7 percent.
We used to be number one in the world in research and development. That's what we were known for. Now we rank number nine in the world. China, decades ago, was number eight in the world. Now it's number two in the world. And other nations are closing in fast.
We used to have the best infrastructure in the worldroads, bridges, et ceterabut then we fell torated 13th best interstateinvestment in infrastructure. Two to thirteen. How can you have the best economy in the world without the best infrastructure in the world? How do you get product from one place to another?
I was out in Pittsburgh recently, the ""City of Bridges""bridges collapsing all over the Nation. You've seen on television railroad bridges collapsing.
Bidenomicswe're turning this around. We're supporting targeted investments. We're strengthening America's economic security, our national security, our energy security, and our climate security.
I designed and we signed a bipartisan infrastructure law. It's already announcedand youI heard some of the speakers before touting some of it. It's already announced 35,000 projects across the country.
Think of it this way: Nearly a century ago, Franklin Roosevelt's Rural Electrification ActRural Electrificationbrought electricity to millions of Americans in rural America. Seventy years ago, Dwight Eisenhower launched the Interstate Highway System, the largest infrastructure project to date in history. That's what the bipartisan infrastructure law does. It will be for our kids and grandkids, only bigger.
Just last week, we announced our plan to bring affordable high-speed internet to end a decade ofthatof unaffordable and inaccessible internet to every home in America, every small business in America. And to no one's surprise[applause]. And to no one's surprise, it's bringing along converts. People strenuously opposed, voting against it when we had this going on. They werethis was going to ""bankrupt America.""
Well, there's a guy named Tuberville froma Senator from Alabama, who announced that he strongly opposed the legislation. Now he's hailing its passage. Here's what he said: Quote, ""It's great to see Alabama receive critical funds to boost ongoing broadband efforts."" [Laughter]
[At this point, the President made the sign of the cross.]
[Laughter] We're replacing every single lead pipe in this country and putting our children's health back directly[applause]400,000 schools, 10 million homes. We're fixing crumbling bridges, upgrading our power grid, renovating our airports and ports. And, Dick, you'reor one of you talked about that, how important that is for the Great Lakes as well.
Anyway, last week we reopened I-95, back where I live. And you go up the East Coastit's one of the most important lengths in the entire East Coast. Well, guess what? Less thanwea guy driving a truck hit aanyway, he knocked down a whole bridge, and the wholeblocked four lanes of the highway.
I went up there, and I said, ""We're going to get thisthe number-one project, to get done."" Within 1 week of my being there, 2 weeks of it happening, tanker trucks that crashed and caused this overpass that has 150,000 vehicles travel on it every day and 14,000 trucks.
It's critical to our economy. We did it with union workers. We closed all the loopholes. We used all American products, all American materials. We usedFederal infrastructure project, made in America. Made in America. Not a slogan; it's actually happening.
You know, when Roosevelt passed the legislation in the thirties about unions being able to be engaged, everybody thinks he just legalized unions. It said we should encourage unions. There was a little provision there that very few Presidents paid attention to. It said, ""Buy American."" That meant that if a President was given money by the Congress to build, say, a new deck in an aircraft carrier, whatever it was, he or she was supposed to use a hundred-percent American labor and a hundred percent American products. It hardly happened. They'd get exceptions down to 30 percent, et cetera.
I changed all that. We're now investing in key industries of the future, making targeted investments to promote domestic production of semiconductors, batteries, electric cars, clean energy.
Under the trickle-down economic theory was that public investment would discourage private investment. Give me a break. [Laughter] We went to see a whole lot of major corporations and said, ""Are you more or less likely to invest if the Government invests?"" Overwhelminglythey had it backwardsthey said, ""No, we're more likely to invest if the Government invests.""
Public investment declined here at home. Industries that we invented started to move overseas, like semiconductors. I want to remind you: America invented these chips, small computer chips the size of the tip of your finger that affect nearly everything in your life, from whether your cell phone functions, your automobiles can be built, refrigerators work. It goes on and onand to sophisticated weapons systems.
It's all in that littlewithout that computer chip, we've got a real problem. But over time, we went from producing 40 percent of those world's chips down to 10 percent. Not anymore.
Biden economics means the industries of the future are going to grow right here at home. At home. I mean it. Not a joke. Under Bidenomics, we've already had over $490 billion in private investment commitments$490 billionfrom U.S. companies and companies around the world coming to the United States of America.
Working with our global partners, America's investments in clean energy technology are going to reduce carbon emissions, continue to lower the cost of windyou talked about the wind farms you're talking about. You know, it's already cheaper. Wind and solar are already significantly cheaper than coal and oil. You're not going to see anybody building a new coal-fired plant in America, not just because I'd like to pass a law to say that. It's too expensive. It doesn't work anymore. Solar power is not just here, but around the world.
And we used to be the center of building these solar panels. We are coming back and doing it again. America is going to lead again.
Look, it's a win for the United States and a win for the world that builds on my decision to rejoin the Paris climate agreement on the first day I came to office. The first day.
And by the way, my predecessor talked a lot about increasing manufacturing. Remember ""Infrastructure Week""? [Laughter] Infrastructure Week became Infrastructure Week and week and week and week and week. It never happened. [Laughter] We got Infrastructure Decade done right off the bat.
But in reality, construction of manufacturing facilities here on U.S. soil grew only 2 percent on my predecessor's watch in 4 years. Two percent. On my watch, it's grown nearly 100 percent in 2 years100 percent[applause]with the help of all the Members of Congress who are here. And I'm not being solicitous.
LookWeirton, West Virginia: It used towhere a steel mill closed in the beginning of this centuryin 2001 or -2, in that range. It employed thousandsit had thousands of good-paying jobs that were lost.
But today, with the help from the inflection reduction actInflation Reduction Act, a new plant is being built, building iron-air batteries, which are going to help store energy. And these batteries are going to help store energy. And it's being built on the same exact site, bringing back 750 good-paying jobs, bringing back a sense of pride and hope for the future, for all the people or Weirton and surrounding areas.
I believe every American willing to work hard should be able to say where they grew up and stay where they grew up. That's Bidenomics. You know, my dad used to have an expression. He'd say, ""Joey""and I give you my word. He'd saymy dad was a well-read guy, never got to go to college, and a hard-working gentleman.
We had dinner atwhere we incidentally had conversation and incidentally ate. My dad used to say, ""Remember, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck."" And I mean this; I give you my word. He would say: ""A job is about a lot more than a paycheck, Joey. It's about your dignity. It's about pride. It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay.'""
Think about it. I mean literal sense, think about that. It's about your dignity, how you're treated, and being able to make a living; you can tell your kids it's going to be okay.
The second big part of Bidenomics is empowering American workers.
When I took office, unemployment was over 6 percent. With the American Rescue Plan, we've provided relief and support directly to working class families. Our economy came roaring back. Unemployment dipped below 4 percent by the end of my first year in office. Now it's been below 4 percent for the longest stretch in 50 years in American history.
And I must admit I concentrated on it, but we've seen, with the help of Jesse Jackson's legacy and a lot of other people here, we've seen record-low unemployment for African Americansrecord-low unemployment for African Americansand Hispanic workers with disabilities.
The lowest unemployment rate in 70 years for American women, and you make up half the economy and probably two-thirds of the brains. [Applause] No, really, think about it.
To pause for a second: When I was trying to getname me a time when you thought any Democrat would get the endorsementeverywithin a week, every single environmental group out there, the AFL-CIO, the women's groups.
I mean, here's the deal: When I sat with the AFL-CIO, when I sat with the IBEWstarting when I ran last timeI said: ""Here's the deal though: I'm going to be the most pro-Americanmost pro-union President in history, but you've got to employ more women, you've got to attract more African Americans, and you've got to attract more minorities."" They have; they're going now. It's beginning to change.
In every industry, fromanyway, I'mI go to these sites where they're trainingby the way, the other thing I've told labor guys: You've got to brag a little bit more about what you do. Do you realize to get a license to be an electrician in this town or any other you've got to essentially go to 4 years of college? You have to go through an apprenticeship that takes you 4 years to 5, depending, or you can't get a job. You get paid a little bit, but you can't get your license to be an electrician, a labor electrician, until that happens.
Look, pay for low-wage workers has grown at the fastest pace in over two decades. Full employment means workers, especially low-wage workers, having more bargaining power to demand good pay, to secure good jobs.
And this is the thing that isn't consistent with whether people think that we're moving in the right direction: Job satisfaction, based on every poll, is at a 36-year high. More people are satisfied with their jobs than any time in 36 years.
And the shame of working-age Americans in the workforcethe share of themthe share of them is the highest it's been in 20 years. Remember what they were saying? ""Biden's policy isn't working. He's just paying people not to work, people on the sidelines."" Well, guess what? Every single day in 4 years before I took officeyou may remember, I took a lot of criticism in my Presidency. Republicans charged me with encouraging people to stay home and not work. Well, they were wrong.
The evidence is clear: Americans are back to work who have been on the sidelines, and they want to come back. And we're going to continue this progress by making sure every American has the training and education to participate in this new economy.
We've increased Pell grants and made landmark investments in historic Black universities. We've invested more in registered apprenticeships and centerand career technology education programs than any previous administration in American history.
Because of this new economy, we don't need everyone to have a 4-year degree. It's great if you can get one; we're trying to make it easier for you to get one. But you don't need it to get a good-paying job anymore.
Think of this: How many of you remember going back to high school, and they had shop class, and they had classes where people can learn if they were interested in working with their hands? They don't have them very much anymore, anywhere around the country.
Well, my wife teaches at a community college, full time, still. [Laughter] She has an expression; she says, ""Any country that outcompetes us, that out""excuse me""that outeducates us will outcompete us."" We're not going to let that happen. That's why we're investing significantly in education.
I'm determined to keep fighting for universal pre-K and free community college. We're also fighting to make[applause]. We're also fighting to make childcare more affordable because we know one benefit is that it opens up significant opportunities for parents to be able to go back and join the workforce.
We're also making it easier to empower workers by making it easier to join a union. As I said, I promised to be the most pro-union President in history. And I tell business leaders all the time: Our union workers are the best in the world.
It takes 4 to 5 years in that apprenticeship. It's like going to college. They'll do the right job on time. Long-term costs for business is less.
You know, addressing the 40-year decline in unionization by supporting project labor agreements, collective bargaining, prevailing wage laws, that's the reason today Americans' support of unions is higher than it's been in 60 years60 years.
And by the way, I met with the Business Roundtable and others. They said, ""Why am I so pro-union?"" And I said, ""Because it helps you."" It really does. Think about it.
The total cost of a major project goes down when you have the best workers in the world doing it. Not a joke. It's true. It lasts longer. You don't have to worry about whether that socket's going to work.
Look, young people are organizing in new companies and industries. You know, I've indicated laborto labor leaders they must expand their ranks. As I said: more women, more minorities. That's what they've got to do.
The third part of Biden economics is promoting competition. Because when companies have to compete on a level playing field, they have to work harder to attract customers and recruit and retrain workers. Some of you businesspeople in here know that well.
But under the trickle-down economic theory, three-quarters of U.S. industries grew more consecratedI mean, excuse meconsecrated [concentrated; White House correction]. I'm thinking I didn't go to Mass. [Laughter] They were moving to diminish competition.
Well, that may have been thingsmade things easier for big corporations. But for everybody else, it made it harder and more expensive. It got harder for small businesses to compete. It stifled integration [innovation; White House correction]. It reduced wages for workers. And it made our supply chains more vulnerable.
So, folks, that's been the Republican plan so far: good for big business, bad for everybody else. It's not even that good for big business anymore.
When I came to office, it was a very different plan: a limited concentration of power at the expense of consumers. The cops are back on the beat enforcing antitrust laws.
My administration is working to crack down on what we used to call ""noncompete agreements."" We still call them that.
These prevent 30 million Americansfrom security guards to retail workersfrom walking across the street to a same kind of business and getting a higher paygetting 5 bucks more a week or 10 bucks more a week.
Noncompete agreements? It's one thing to have noncompete agreements when you're dealing with trade secrets. It's another thing when you're doing the same thing of flipping a hamburger, and you're going to get 5 cents more by walking across the street to a different place.
We alsowe've promoted and we're supporting small businesses. You know, Vice President Harris has prioritized providing support and capital for small-business owners, including for rural, minorities, and women entrepreneurs; including through a brandnew program that's already helping deliver billions of dollars in growth capital to small businesses in every State.
We've seen a record 10.5 million applications10.5 million applicationsfor folks looking to start a small business just in the last 2 years10.5. Every one of those applications is an application to hope. Hope.
Competition also means lowering costs for consumers. Bringing down inflation remains one of my top priorities. Today, inflation is less than halfless than halfof what it was a year ago and that inflation caused by Russia and by the war in Ukraine and by what was going on. But we knew we had to do more. There's more than one way to bring down the costs.
Another expression my dad used to usefor real, he'd say: ""Joey""he said: ""At the end of the month, the question is, after you pay all your bills, do you have just a little left for breathing room? Just a little left for breathing room. All your bills paid; do you have anything left?""
Well, inflation eats into that obviously. But guess what? Bringing down the cost of medication goes a long way to giving you a little more.
That's why, through the Inflation Reduction Act, we finally gave Medicare the power to negotiate lower prescription drug prices like the VA does now. We've been trying to get this doneDick and Ifor decades in the Senate. This time, we finally beat Big Pharma for the first time.
You know, the same drug made by the same American company sold in Chicago is more expensive than that same drug sold in Toronto, Great Britain, EnglandFrance, Germany, any city you can name. For real. Now, seniors on Medicare are paying as much as $400lessfourwho were paying $400 a month for insulin last year are now paying $35 a month.
Because guess what? You know how much it costs to make that insulin? Tent-e-ndollars. Package it, maybe 12 total. And the guy who invented the insulin didn't even ask for a patent because he wanted everybody to have access to it.
We're just finishing the first round of negotiating drug prices, and we'll save the taxpayers this year $160 billion. That's like a tax cut. It lowers the cost of prescription drugs, and it lowers the Federal deficit as well.
We're expanding health care coverage for more Americans, building on Barack's Affordable Care Act. You know why we're doing that? I'm proud to strengthen that act, saving average families $800 a year on their health care premiums.
We're also fighting to end junk fees. Most people don't think of it that way. Well, here's what a junk fee is: They can add up to a hundred dollars a monthhundreds of dollars a month for a family. Like that extra fee when you say, ""I want my child to sit next to me when I take him to see Grandpop on the West Coast."" It's not listed now. They're listing it now. [Laughter]
Hotel resort fees. You don't realizeyou're not told they're going to beyou know that ad in television: ""Mine is $200. His is $180""? Well, guess what? Or thethe one that bothers me the most is overdraft fees for banks. The banks made $7.7 billion a year on overdraft fees. You overdraft on your checking, you get a penalty.
It'sone of the leading bank presidentsGod love him, he's passed awaybut he had a yacht. The name of the yacht was ""Overdraft."" [Laughter] Swear to God. Well, guess what? There are going to be no more overdraft fees.
Folks, we're doing thiswe're doing all this, reducing the deficit at the same time. Just in my first 2 years in office, my team and I have reduced the deficit by $1.7 trillion, more than any President has, just in 2 years. And the budget agreement I negotiate, without having to give away anything of consequence, reduced the deficit by another trillion dollars.
You know, reversing 40 years of Republican trickle-down economics that helped the few, but hurt the middle class, it's going to take some time. But what we're inwe're in a place where some big piecesand we're moving in the direction where we can get some more done and people will see it.
What I'm doingand I knew I'd have to do this: All those major legislations we passed, people go, ""That's great."" But theyit takes time to get it out in the field.
It takes time for them to see it. And I'm not here to declare victory on the economy. I'm here to say we have a plan that's turning things around incredibly quickly.
But we have more work to do. For example, does anyone here think the Federal tax system is fair? Raise your hand. No matter how much money you make. We're going to make it fair by eliminating loopholes for crypto traders, hedge fund managers. Big Oil made $200 billion last year and got a $30,000 tax break$30 billion tax break.
We're going to get billionaires to pay up a little bit, at least a minimum tax. You know, when wewhen we began, there were 750before the pandemic750 billionaires in America. Now there are a thousand. You know how much their average tax isthey pay in Federal tax? Eight percent taxes. No billionaire should pay a lower tax rate than a schoolteacher, a firefighter, or a cop. I mean, this is[applause].
And I'm not talking about the old, old days of 70-percent tax. I'm talking about a fair shot. If they just paid the topat the top tax rate that exists now, which is lower than 30 percent, we'd raise billions and billions of dollars, lowering the deficit, allowing us to pay for so much more we have to do.
That's the next phase of this fight: making the Tax Code fair for everyone, making the wealthy and the superwealthy and big corporations begin to pay their fair share, without raising taxes at all on the middle class.
I made a commitment when I got elected: No one in America making under $400,000 would ever have to pay a single penny more in Federal taxes as long as I'm President. And I've kept that promise. And $400,000 is a lot of money where I come from.
Let me close with this. I camewhen I came to office, I had a fundamental decision to make: Are we going to continue to trickle-down economics as a policythat's failed time and again, that grew inequality, that saw jobs go overseas, that sawand you've seen it out heretowns hollowed out.
I ran on the promise I was going to end this and that I'd begin to build an economy from the middle out and the bottom up. We're not going to continue down the trickle-down path as long as I'm President. This is the moment we are finally going to make a break and move away from economy that has existed in a fundamentally different direction.
Here's the simple truth about trickle-down economics: It didn't represent the best of American capitalism, let alone America. It represented a moment where we walked awayand how many in this countryfrom howhow this country was built, how this city was built.
Bidenomics is about the future. Bidenomics is just another way of saying: Restore the American Dream because it worked before.
It's rooted in what we've always worked best at in this country: investing in America, investing in Americans. Because when we invest in our people, we strengthen the middle class, we see the economy grow. That benefits all Americans. That's the American Dream.
Forty years of trickle-down limited that dream atfor thoseexcept for those at the top. Too many for too long have seemingly suggested that it's only available if you have a 4-year college degree and you can work at a teachor work at a tech center.
These new factories that are openingthese fabs that are opening for semiconductors, without a college degree, you're going to make $100- to $130,000 a year working in those fabs[applause]$100- to $130,000 a year.
Well, I believe that every American willing to work hard should be able to get a job no matter where they arein the heartland, in small towns, in every part of this countryto raise their kids on a good paycheck and keep their roots where they grew up. That's Bidenomics.
I think the economic philosophy is not going to restore the American Dream that we have now, that philosophy. But this new one will. And it's going to helpand I think it's going to help lessen the division in this country by bringing us back together. It makes it awful hard to demagogue something when it's working, although they do it all the time.
I've long saidand I mean thisI was on the Tibetan Plateau with Xi Jinping. I traveled 17,000 miles with him. I've spoken with him more than any other head of state because it started when I was Vice President and President Hu was the President, and he was the Vice President. We knew he was agoing to be the successor.
It was inappropriate for Barack to spend that time with him, but I spent a lot of time with him. I met alone with him, just he and I and a simultaneous interpreter, 68 times68 hours68 times, more than 68 hours. By the way, I turned in all my notes. [Laughter]
Butand this is the God's truthhe asked mewe were on the Tibetan Plateau, and he asked mehe said, ""Can you define America for me?"" I said, ""Yes, in one word""and I meant it""possibilities. Possibilities."" We're a land of possibilities. And I told him: It's never been a good bet to bet against America. Never.
And I can honestly[applause]. I can honestly say I've never been more optimistic about America's future. I swear to God. I've never been more optimistic. We just have to remember who we are. We are the United States of America. There is nothingnothingbeyond our capacity if we work together.
So God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

Joseph R. Biden, Remarks on the National Economy in Chicago, Illinois Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/363472 "
2023-06-28 00:00:00,"Remarks at a Campaign Reception in Chicago, Illinois","
Whoa. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Pleaseplease have a seat.
Am I interrupting your lunch? [Laughter] By the way, I will not be offended if you keep eating.
Look, folks, I want to thank Governor Pritzker for that introduction. But more than thatI'd probably ruin his reputation now, but he did more in 2020 to help me get elected President of the United States than just about anybody in the country, and that's a fact. You are part[applause]and he's doing one hell of a job as your Governor. I appreciate his support.
And you know, I also want to thank the other elected officials that are here: Mayor Brandon Johnson, thanks for the key to the city, man. And congratulations to you and Stacie on your wedding anniversary. What a hell of a way to spend youryou owe her big, man, if this is the wedding anniversary. [Laughter]
Dick Durbin, Tammy Duckworth, Representative Laura Underwood: You've been such important partners in everything we've gotten done. And that's not hyperbole. I really am grateful to have you all here today and give me your support.
And I think our national chairman is here. Jaime, stand up, man. Now, I don't want to ruin Jaime's reputation, but he's from South Carolina and he supported my decision to come to Chicago. [Laughter] Anyway, look[laughter]you've been such an important part.
And before I begin, I want to say a word about a good man who was a dear friend and a great American: Jim Crown. You know, I know many of you knew Jim well, and you're heartbroken to learn of hisof a shocking death.
You know, Jim and Paula joined us at the White House just last week at the state dinner for India, and he washe was thoughtful and warm as ever. He represented America's best. And he was industrious, big hearted. And his commitment to this city was bone deep. It was bone deep. And we're all sending our love to Paula and theirand their kids and grandkids and Jim's parents and siblings. He'll be missed.
It's just shocking. Like I said, I just saw him about 10 days ago.
Now, to all of you here today, I want to say thank you for being here. Thank you for your support. And you've helped us get so much done over the past 2 years.
[At this point, the President cleared his throat.]
Excuse me.
Now you're making sure that we have the support we need to finish the job. Folks, I'm actually looking forward to this campaign. And you know why? Because we've got a story to tell. We've got a real story to tell. We've got a record to run on. And most importantly, we're not only changing the country, we're transforming the country.
You know, I just left the Old Post Office, where I talked about my economic vision for the country. And we'rewhat everyone in the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times have been calling ""Bidenomics."" So I said: ""Okay, Bidenomics. I'll take it."" [Laughter]
But look, just think about what it was like when I came to officewhen you got me there. It waswe inherited a mess.
Governor Pritzker remembers all too well. The pandemic was raging. The economy was reeling. Around the world, our allies in Europe and Asia, the Middle Eastthey were saying they didn't know what wethis new President meant by this idea of ""America first.""
I've got to tell youand, Jeffrey, you know thisI've got to tell you that I was stunned at howI've been doing foreign policy my whole life. I was chairman of Foreign Relations Committee. I waswhen I was with Barack, I'd handle a lot of the foreign policy, travel the world, and know most heads of state. And I was stunned. I was stunned at the damage that's been done to our reputation internationally. And that's not hyperbole. I give my word to that.
For the first time since World War II, our friends began to wonder whether we could be relied on.
You know, one of the things I said when Putin invadedand I predicted he was going to invade Ukraine with 185,000 troops; who ever thought that would happen in the postwar era in Europe? I predicted that he was counting on NATO breaking, not holdingnot being held togetherbut we united NATO. We're once again viewed as a world leader.
We created 13 million new jobsmore jobs in 2 years than any President has ever created in a 4-year term. Unemployment rate is down to a 50-year low. Went down to 3.7 percent.
You know, we've seen record lows in Black and Hispanic unemployment as well. Inflation is less than half it wasless than half it was a year ago. Still too high, but it's way down.
And, folks, this didn't happen. We made it happen.
I came to office with a theory and a planand one that I've been fighting for my whole career, but I had a chance to actually implement it as President.
The theory was, it was time to end the trickle-down economics, traditional economics; 40 years of handing out excessive tax cuts, the big corporations had been a bust. We had gonewell, allwhen it was all done, we hollowed out the middle class in America. We blew up the deficit significantly. We shipped jobs overseas because of cheaper labor. We stripped the dignity and pride and hope of one community after another all across America, particularly from Western Pennsylvania and going through the Middle EastI mean, through the middle of the country and down south.
So we're changing that. We're replacing their trickle-down theory with what the economists are calling Bidenomics. It's working. Bidenomics is about building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up. When that occurs, the middle class does well, the poor have a chance, and the wealthy still do very, very welldo very well.
I'm a capitalist. If you can go out and make a million or a billion dollars, it's good by me, as long as you just pay your fair share in taxesnot exorbitant, not like the old days, but the top tax rate in the 30 percent range.
Look, we started with the American Rescue Plan, a plan to vaccinate the Nation and get our economy going. And that's what it did. Not a single Republican in Congress voted for that plan. Not one single, solitary Republican. But we got it done.
Next, we passed the bipartisan infrastructure law, because you can't have the strongest economy in the world with a second rate infrastructure. Can you believe we used to have the best infrastructure in the world, but now we're ranked 13th in the world in infrastructure?
Under my predecessor, Infrastructure Week became a punchline. Remember it was going to beno, I'm not joking. It became a punchline. On my watch, making infrastructure was a decade headline. We're going to do it. We're going to get it done.
Now we're investing in America, and it's just comingeverybody says: Why am I only talking about this now? We got all these big pieces of legislation passed, and we were told we couldn't get it passed, becauseit took time, without any Republican help in most cases. And now it's there, and we've got to let people know what we've done and how we've done it and why we did it.
You know, our roads, our bridges, our ports, our airports, clean water, high-speed internet, and so much more. Already, we started 35,000 projects all across America.
Earlier this year, Kamala was here in Chicago, at the 95th Street Bridge, to talk about improvements we're making there, and three other bridges nearby. They haven't had major repairs in decades. It's causing traffic detours. I don't have to tell you Chicagoans this. Supply chain delays, from Lake Michigan to the Gulf of Mexico. And that's a fact. That law is going to change all that.
If you wonder where we're investing in your region, just go to invest.govinvest.gov. You'll see a map; it will show exactly what we're doing in every single project.
For exampleand for everybodyI said I'd be President for everybody, not just those who voted for me, not just in blue districts. Everybody.
And here's what's happened. You know, we'vewe found that all these guys that voted against all this, they think it's great now, man. No[laughter]well, I won't get into all that. [Laughter] I just get excited.
Third, we passed the CHIPS and Science Act. America got a wake-up call during the pandemic. We didn't think much about supply chains before. Well, we do now. I know we can never again be as vulnerable as we were. I've determined that will never happen again.
One key component, for example: semiconductorsthose little chipsthe computer chips, smaller than the end of my little finger. These small littlelittle computer chips. Without them, your cell phones don't work; your automobiles cannot be made300 parts3,000 chips in there; and the most sophisticated weapons systems the United States has can't be functional. We invented those chips. The United States made the first chip. We invented it. We made it much more sophisticated.
But, over time, we went from producing 40 percent of the world's chips down to 10 percent. And you saw what happened when they got cut off because of the pandemic andin Asia. What happened? We stopped being able to make automobiles because they need 33,000 of these chips to run. It'sI mean, everything began to shut down.
But we're turning this around. Now the private sector has announced they're investing $490 billion in advanced manufacturing, as well as clean energy, in America$490 billion.
The fourth thing we did: We passed the Inflation Reduction Act. And we getthat gavewe gave Medicare the power to negotiate lower prescription drug prices, like the VA has been able to do. DickDick Durbin and I have been fighting for this for a long time.
Well, you know, I don'tI want to be cleareverybody thinks it's an exaggeration, but hold up here a secondis that a drug company that makes a product, a drug, here in the United States, if it's sold in Chicago, you can buy it cheaper in Florence, Italy; you can buy it cheaper in Israel; you can buy it cheaper in England; you can buy it cheaper in Toronto. Why? Why?
We allow the VA to negotiate prices for drugs for veterans. But guess what? Every time Big Pharmawhen Dick and I would try to do this, every time we'dit stopped us every time. But not this time. [Laughter] Not this time.
We took on Big Pharma and won this time. Now seniors on Medicare are payinginstead of as much as $400 a month for insulin last year, they're paying $35 a month. It costs only $12 to make it and package it. This is life-changing.
In the first round of negotiations of drug prices, we're going to save the taxpayers $160 billion. That meansand by the way, it reduces the deficit by $160 billion, and it gives people breathing room to be able to help with their inflation.
My dad used to say: ""You know, ifinflation isis a problem, but at the end of the month the question is: When you pay all your bills, do you have anythingdo you have any breathing room? Do you have anyanything left?""
We not only cut inflation, we're going to continue to cut inflation. But this gives people more breathing room, these bills.
And this bill includes the biggest investment, not only in America, but anywhere in the world in climate change$369 billion, without a single Republican vote.
And that's not all we've done. We passed the most significant legislation to reduce gun violence in 30 years, strengthening background checks, ""red flag"" laws. We banned ghost guns. We have a lot morewe have a lot more to do though.
With Dick's leadership, we kept our promise to put the first Black woman on the Supreme Court. And by the way, I think she may be the intellectually brightest person on the Court. [Laughter] She's incredible. Ketanji Brown Jackson, she is incredible.
We appointed more Black women to the Federal circuit courts than all previous Presidents combined. Combined.
And, folks, I'm not going into much detail, but we've also reestablished our leadership in the world. We've united and strengthened NATO in defense of Ukraine.
You know, as I said, the one thingthe one thing that Putin was counting on was he would split NATO; we wouldn't stay togetherwe wouldn't be together. Seriously, not a joke. Think about it.
Well, we strengthened the alliance in the Indo-Pacific with a thing called a Quad. I brought together Japan, Australia, India, and the United States. The Indian Ocean is a different place now.
Japan's military budget, they haven't increased that budget since the war, but they've significantly increased the budget to help us in that region of the world to work with us. They made an agreement with South Korea to end their significant disagreement that lasted since World War II. And guess what? They're providing support for Ukraine. They're engaged. They said they understand. No, but think about it.
I spent a lot of time with the Prime Minister. He said: ""I understand. When you have 185,000 troops invade another country, why won't Taiwan be next? Why won't something else happen out here?""
So we united 40 nations of the world that are engaged. In short, restored America standing on the world stage.
We're doing all this while still cutting the deficit. You know, all the talk about big spenders and what weguess what? A budget agreement I just negotiated with the Republicans, we cut anothernearly a trillion dollars without giving up any of the main requirements that I was for.
On top of that, I cut in just my budget, in 2 years, $1.7 trillion off the Federal debt. No President has ever done that. We did all this, and we cut $1.7 trillion from the Federal debt in two years.
And, folks, look, you rememberyou know, when I talk about corporate taxesI'm a capitalist. You can go out and make millions and billions of dollars. Have at it. It helps. But guess what? You've got to pay a little bit.
Remember when the Fortune 500, the top four55 companies made $400 billion and didn't pay$40 billion and didn't pay a penny in taxes? Well, guess what? They had to pay 15 percent, and that paid for all of this we needed. [Laughter] No, I'm not joking. Think about it. Think about it.
That's just some of what we've been able to accomplish with your help in the first 2 years. Imagine what we can do now. We're here todayI'm here today to ask you to help me finish the job.
For example, we'll cut the deficit more once we make the Tax Code fair, closing loopholes. For example, I come from the corporate State of America. More corporations aremany of you have corporations that are investedare incorporated in Delaware than every other State in the Union. And I represented that State for 36 years as a progressive Democrat.
But closing loopholes, for example, on crypto traders, hedge fund managers. There's a lot of loopholes in the Tax Code that don't make any sense.
Getlook, there used to be 750 billionaires in America 4 years ago. Now there are 1,000. You know what the averagethe average tax rate they pay? Eight percent. Come on. That's less than a schoolteachers, a cop, a firefighter. Just begin to pay a little bit. It's time for the wealthy to start paying their fair share in the country.
I made a promise, and I'll keep it, and I've kept it so far: No one in America making less than $400,000 will see one single, solitary penny in their Federal taxes raised. $400,000. And I've kept that promise, and I will keep it.
But there's so much to doso much to do on the social agenda as well. That's all they want to talk about isyou know, weI made a speech when I ran the first time atat the Independence Hall. And I said our democracy was at stake. And the press said, ""What the hell is he talking about democracy for?""
Well, it turned out 66 percent of the American people agreed with me. Democracy is at stake, and part of it is still at stake.
Let's protect a woman's right to choose and codify Roe v. Wade. No, I really mean it.
Folks, I love the arrogance of the Supreme Court decision. After they said there's no right to privacy in the Constitution, I said a lot else is at stake: contraception, gay marriage, et cetera, because they're based on the right to privacy. And the famous judge, who I will not mention his name, said there are no longersince there's no longer the idea of privacy in the Constitution, they're not protected. They're going to come after it.
Well, guess what? We're in a situation where they saidIone of the best lines in the Dobbs decision to me wasthey said: This is a state matter. It's not a Federal matter. And nowand I'm paraphrasingand now let's see what women can actually do.
They ain't seen nothing yet. No, I'm seriousState by State.
But lookand let's keep fighting the existential threat thatthe only existential threat to humanity is climate change. I mean, for real. If we go above 1.5 degrees Celsius by the year 2050, we're in trouble. There's no turning it around.
Let's protect our children from gun violence and finally, once again, banning assault weapons and high-magazines. We did it once. And when we did, mass murders came down significantlysignificantly. Who the hell needs a magazine that can hold 100 rounds? I mean, seriously, like what happenedanyway.
Let's keep lowering prescription drug costs, not just for those Medicare, but for all Americans.
Let's continue to restore the soulI ran for three reasons, I said, when I ranwhen I announced. Even my staff: ""What are you talking about?""
The first one was, I said we had to restore the soul of this Nation: a sense of decency, a sense of honor, a sense of who we are as American people.
Secondly, I said we had to rebuild the economy through the middle class, from the bottom up and the middle out. We had to do that to make things work.
And I said, thirdly, we had to unite America. And I was toldand understandably, the press said, ""Biden is from another generation."" I'm going to say something that maybe Dick or other Members of the Senate can confirm: I was known as the guy that got a lot of things done in the Senatea lot of things done. I had relationships across the aisle, and it worked. And we had friendships. But they said: ""That was another day. You can't do it anymore.""
We got enough people to step up and come acrossenough Republicansto pass most of this stuff.
Let me close with this. Here's the bottom line; it's very simple: We need you. That's not hyperbole. We need you. Our democracy needs you, because this is about our freedoms.
MAGA Republicans are trying to take us backwards. But together, we're not going to let them.
I truly believe this countryand I know I don't look it, but I've been around a long time. [Laughter] I truly believe that this country is about to take off. The investments we've made in the past 2 years have the power to transform this country for the next 50 years. We're doing something right now that no one thought possible.
But the RepublicansRepublicans don't like any of it.
[A toddler screeched in the audience.]
I don't blame you, kiddo. [Laughter] He agrees.
Most of them have opposed everything I've done. Most of them want to get rid of it all, but they don't hesitate to take credit for it.
I tell you what, there's that Senatorhe's a hell of a football coach in Alabamawho is now the Senator from AlabamaTubervillewho strongly opposed the legislation that now he's hailing its passage. He voted against the legislation. He says, ""Great to see Alabama receive critical funds to boost ongoing broadband efforts."" End of quote. I told him I'll see him at the groundbreaking. [Laughter]
We've got a fight on our hands. Let me ask you: Are you with me in this fight?
It's been a long time, but I can honestly say I've never been more optimistic. I know a lot of people[inaudible], but they don'tI believe it, because I know the people of this country.
We've got to just remember who we are. We're the United States of America, and there's nothingand I mean this from the bottom of my heart. Think about it: Nowe've never come out of a problem without being stronger than when we went in.
We have never, never, never failed to accomplish what we set our minds to. There's nothing beyond our capacity if we do it together.
So God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

Joseph R. Biden, Remarks at a Campaign Reception in Chicago, Illinois Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/363473 "
2023-06-27 00:00:00,"Remarks at a Campaign Reception in Chevy Chase, Maryland","
Well, first of all, thank you. You know, people indicate that putting on a fundraiser is no big deal. It's a giant deal. You've had Secret Service running through the house. [Laughter] You've had all kinds of people. Yes. Your neighbor is saying, ""What the hell you're blocking the roads out there for?"" [Laughter]
So thank you, thank you, thank you. And I want to thank everyone here. And I know that there's a great concern about the situation in Israel. I'm happy to take some questions on that. But I just want you to know that, you know, I've often said, from the time I came to the United States Senate, I've beenand Stu knowsan incredibly strong supporter of the State of Israel.
I've often said: If there weren't[inaudible]we'd have to invent one. My dad was what a lot of those of you involved in the community would call a righteous Christian. Our dinner table was a placethis is the God's truthwhere we wouldmy dad worked late tohe ran an automobile dealership. Didn't own it, but he ran it. And he'd come home for dinner every night. And at our house, dinner was a place where you'd ask questions and incidentally ate.
And my dad would rail against whatwhy we didn't bomb the railroad tracks, the camps, why we took so long to allow the ships to come in, et cetera. And he talked about a phrase that was used often then and still: that silence is complicity. And I mean thisthis is a fact; everybody knows this about my dad, when he was alive and at home.
And my dad talked about the fact thatthe idea thatand by the way, Chris Dodd's dad was part of the Commission to investigate what happened in the concentration camps. And he'd talk about why we didn't do a lot at the time.
And you know, one of the interesting things is that he used to talk about how it was impossible for the Israelis toexcuse methe Germans not to know what was going on. And so he convinced me before helong before he died: The one thing I've done, I've taken every one of my children to Dachau and every one of my grandchildren, because I wanted them to seeI wanted them to see those beautiful homes along the fence line with the beautiful roofs and lovely homes, and they'd pretend they didn't know. But they knew. And I wanted my kids to understand howhow that happened.
Now, I've taken every one of mymy three childrenBeau was alive at the timeas well as my grandchildren. I have eight grandchildren; I have two to go. They're too young. But, by the way, they're even trying to change a little bit of what Dachau looked like at the time. It's much more sanitized than it was.
But the point I'm trying to make is, there's been an unbreakable bond we've had with Israel. Our relationship is defined by a genuine friendship. It's defined by a shared interest and shared democratic values. And America is the only nation, in my viewand some of you heard me say this beforethat was founded on an idea. Every other nation has been founded based on geography, ethnicity, religion, and whatever.
We're the only one thatI apologize to the press for hearing me say this so many timesbut we're the only nation in the world founded on an idea. Nothing else unites us but that idea. And it's one that we say that we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men and women are created equal, endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rightslife, liberty, et cetera.
We've never fully lived up from it, but we've never walked away from it. We've never walked away from it.
And one of the things that concerns me isyou inadvertently mentioned when you were introducing meand that is that democracy is at stake. Democracy is at stake not just here but around the world. And I called a meeting of all the leading democracieswhich we've done. We have fewer democracies today than we had 15 years ago.
And one of the things that I think is important to keep our focus on is that I've been stunned at the damage done by the last administration to us internationally and globally. I mean, I've been stunned how deep it goes. His ""one America""his, you know, ""America only"" policy has been disastrous. This is a guy who wanted us to pull out of NATO. This is a guy who thought Putin was an admirable guy. This is a guy who thought we could deal withit just went on and on and on.
So what I've doneI've spent a great deal of my time, in a bizarre way, trying to put the world back together againnot because I'm so special, but I just happen to be President. So I've met with over 89 heads of state so far, and I'vetrying to make sure that they understand we're not that nation. We're not the nation that existed.
I'll tell you a really quick story. When I showed up for the first G-7 meeting back when I was just elected in February in London, the G-7I sat down with all the otherother major democracies and their major economies. And I said, ""America is back."" And one of the memberone of the heads of state turned to me and said: ""For how long? For how long?""
And then another one said, ""Joe""he would call me ""Mr. President""; we call each other ""Joe"" now. But he saidI saidhe said, ""Mr. President, what would you do if you woke up tomorrow morning and read in the London Times that a thousand people broke into the House of Commons, broke the doors down, killed two bobbies, andto overturn an election that was occurring in the House of Commons? What would you think?""
And I never thought about it quite before. But that's how the worldthe rest of the world wonders. They wonder about are we really back.
And one of the things that you've just seen what's happened in Russia, with Wagner andthe groupand Putin: The fact is that Putin was certain that he was going to be able to break up NATO. And Stu knows this: He was positive this was going to be the effect.
So I've spent over 180 hours directly meeting with the group and/or individually, as recently as on the telephone and Zoom with each of the heads of state in Europe this past couple of days, because they look to the United States to decide what we're going to do, how we're going to proceed.
My generic point is this: We have a lot to do, but we have enormous opportunities in terms of American foreign policy. We put together withthe Japanese have been wonderful. They've been wonderful. They've increased their budget. They'rethey are engaged in a European war by saying that ""We can't allow it to happen.""
We findand you know, I became friends with the Prime Minister of Japan. And he indicated to me he was going to make things better with South Korea. He did it. He told me what he was going to do. And I strongly supported it, the idea. South Korea and Japan have hadnot had a relationship.
So there's a lot happening around the world. We've also put together a thing called the Quad in the Indian Ocean and in the South China Sea, affecting theall that security surrounding whatwhat thewhat Xi Jinping is very worried about: being isolated.
Well, that's not the purpose. He asked me why I'm doing what I'm doing. I've beenspent more time meeting with Xi Jinping than any person inthat holds a government office, mainly because it started when I was Vice President.
We knew he was going to become the President. And what happened was: Barack couldn't be talking to him and dealing with him, but I did. And I traveled with him over 17,000 miles in the United States and in China. I know him well.
The point is, he called me and said: ""Why are you doing the Quad? You're trying to surround us and hurt us."" I said: ""No, we just don't want the international rules ofto change relative to airspace and sea space, and you're trying to do that. We're not going to go along with it.""
My generic point is that we're uniting the rest of the world in a way that it hasn't been united before. We have a long way to go. I don't want to overstate it, but I don't want to understate it either.
And we talk about China being this great power. China has enormous problemsenormous problems. I'm not going to get into it right now. But the idea that they are going to be able to do things that they thought they could do is not accurate.
Domestically, I wasI ranand I'll be very brief. I ran with a specific objective. I was sick and tired of trickle-down economics, the fundamentals of economics. They didn'tthey weren't working for America. They weren't working for America. Not much trickled down to my dad's my dad's kitchen table in terms of helping him. And so I thought it was really important. And I thought the key to the United States power[inaudible]in economic growth and stability was when the middle class was growing.
When the middle class does well, everybody does well. The wealthy do very well. The poor have a way up, and the middle class is just fine. And so I've spent a lot of timeand I'm making the speech tomorrow on what thewhat the Wall Street Journal referred to as ""Bidenomics."" Well, it's working. It's working. We've created 1713.2 million jobs in 2 yearsmore jobs than any President ever has created in 4 yearsever. We've also reduced the Federal deficit by $1.7 trillion. No one has ever done that. The reason it's working is because we're engaging everyone.
And by the wayand I know I get criticized for being so pro-labor. I make no apologies for it. The reason I'm so pro-labor is because, you know, these are people who are feeling left behind. They're feelingbut they alsoand they'reand they're clean now.
And here's the deal. You have a circumstance where, you know, to beto get a license to be an electrician, you've got to spend 5 years5 years5 years as an apprentice getting partial pay. And they don'tpeople don't realize that.
And I met with the Business Roundtable. Told themand they said why am I so pro-labor? I said: ""What did you say to me when I was working with the Secretary of Commerce on theas Vice President? What do you need most?"" We interviewed three hundredand I thinkfifty-eight corporate heads. They said, ""We need a better educated workforce."" I said, ""Why aren't you educating them then?""
I said, ""I come from a State of DuPont. More corporations incorporated in my State than every other State in America combined. And the dayand they were the eighth largest corporation when I got elected. Eighth. And guess what? When they bought a new enterprise, they trained their workers. You guys don't spend any money training your workers. You expect the government to do it. So why in the hell are you against my effort to increase education funding?"" And they all looked at me like, ""Hmm, never quite thought of that.""
But my generic point is, it's changing. The idea that any President could be endorsed within a week by the environmental movement, all of it; by the AFL-CIO, all of them; by the women's organizations, all of them; and by significant elements of corporate America in one week, because we're doing something right.
We're notIthe only thing we have disagreements on these days is taxes. I think everybody should pay your fair share. When you've got a millionyou've gotnow we have a thousand billionaires. I'm a capitalist. If you can make a million bucks, make it. It's okay by me. Multimillionaire? Good. It's good for the country. But pay your taxes. Not 8 percent average8 percent. A cop pays more than that. A firefighter pays more than that. We've got to make sure that people know. That's the one thing that we stillwe haven't done very well.
Lastly, I also thought it was really important to deal withas my dad used to saymy dad was a well-read man who never got to go to college. And my dadyouour dinner table was a place where you sat down to have conversation and incidentally eat. And I'm not joking. I'm not joking when I say that. And one of the things that he said washe used to say: ""Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay.'"" And he meant it. He meant it.
Well, one of the things we've been able to do, for examplehe'd also say that, ""At the end of the month, do you have any breathing room?""
We talked about inflation. And I'll end with this. We have inflation down for 11 months in a row, notwithstanding some of the dire predictions of theof recessions next month. Hadn't happened yet. I don't think it will because the basis of the economy is so strong nowso strong. But we'll see. I could be wrong.
But here's the point: My dad used to make the point that it wasn't whether the price of gasoline went up and food went up and all those thingswhich are badand housing. But it was about: Do you have any money left at the end of the month?
And guess what? What's the biggest bill most people over 65 pay? Health care. Health care. Why is it that you havewe have the best drug companies in the worldsame drug company making an important product sold here in the United States and around the worldsame exact productyou can buy it more cheaply in Toronto and you can buy it more cheaply in Germany, Londonin London, you canFrankfurt, Germany. Why? Why is that? Because right now, it's the only industry we can't bargain with. Only industry we can't bargain with. And you pay billions of dollars a year in Medicare expenses. Billionstens of billions a year.
Well, guess what? In my negotiations with the Speaker of the House when they shut down the Governmentthat issuenot ""trying to""but trying to avoid shutting down the Government. Ihe wantedthey wanted to get rid of what I just passed. Well, what we just passed was: Medicare can negotiate the price of what it cost.
For example, any of youI'm sure all of you know someone who needswho has type 1 or 2 diabetes and needs insulin. Well, guess what? The average cost of insulin for a month is 400 bucks a month. And you know how much it costs to make? Tent-e-ndollars. Ten. The guy who invented insulin didn't patent it because he thought it should be available to everybody. It cost 12 bucks to package ita total of 12 bucks.
So guess what? We just had Medicare negotiate it. The price of insulin is now, for on a monthly basis, $35. Thirty-five dollars.
And I can go down the list. We're going toI alsoeight different drugs aa year can be negotiated as well. If you go to thefor example, the VA, they negotiated all their prices. You want to sell us drugs or insulin? You comeyouwe negotiate the price with you.
My generic point is, at the kitchen table, if you were able to deal with a little money at the end of the yearyou got a little money at the end of the year. I can go down the list.
For example, when my staff thought I was crazy when I said: ""We ought to deal with junk feesjunk fees."" Well, guess what? You know we haveand most peopleit deprives people of their pride. You want to take your grandson or daughter to see your mom on the Easton the West Coast, you're going to be surprised when you find you pay almost double the price to have your child sit next to you. You're not told about that.
Old bank overdrafts, you know how much it is[inaudible]? Fifty-five billion dollars a year. Okay? They're one of theand I won't name them, but you could check it outone of the CEOs had a yacht called ""Overdraft."" My word, it's now sunk. [Laughter]
But my generic point is, it's just about treating people with decency. Just let people know what's going on. And that's what we're doing.
And one of the things that have started andfor example, I usedand remember in the beginning you said: ""Biden you can never get anything done bipartisanly. Not possible."" Well, guess what? We did. We did. We passed the act thatyou know, dealing with veterans exposed all those burn pits.
We owewe have a lot of sacred obligation and only one truly sacred obligation: Equip those folks we send to war and take care of them and their families when they come home. Well, guess what? Not anymore. They're going to have to be paid for those losses because of exposure to those burn pits. Why wouldn't we do that?
We used to be number one in the world in infrastructure. We're now number 18. How in God's name do you runhow do you have the most powerful nation in the world with a second rate infrastructure? I'm notI think it's actually we're number 10.
And the same thing withwe justjust go down the list. We used to invest more in research and development than any country in the world: 2 percent of our GDP. Know what it is now? Point seven-tenths of 1 percent. How do we lead the world?
Computer chips. We were the guys that went outwe invented the semiconductor. We invented it. Inventedwe made it sophisticated. We used to have 40 percent of the market; we now have 10 percent in the market.
If you decided it was better to buy it overseas""Buy America""people are criticizing me for the Buy America is a provision passed in the thirties. It's totally consistent with all of our international trade. If a President is given money to put a new deck of an aircraft carrier, he's allowed to say, ""We're going to have American labor and AmericanAmerican products on it.""
Well, guess what? I've said that. Democrat and Republican Presidents of the past didn't say that. They made exceptions saying you can only haveyou need 10 percent or whatever.
Well, guess what? Manufacturing is back. We have created 800,000 jobs800,000 manufacturing jobs. A major article today in Bloomberg, you ought toI'll leave a copy behindaboutno, I'm seriousmajor article andby a Syracuse paper saying how we're bringing back all of manufacturingthink of all the placesand youwe've been campaigning a lot together, Stuthink of all the places where in a place like inin the Midwest or in Western Pennsylvania orwhere all of a sudden, the factory that's been around employing 2-, 3-, 5-, 700 people for years and years gets shut down. Why does it get shut down? Because labor is cheaper overseas, we export the jobs and import the products. Not anymore. Not anymore.
Onewe're going to put $495 billion in private investment, just since I've become President, in infrastructure, as well as new endeavors. Almost $500 billion.
This idea that when our Government is settingwe did a survey: Are you more likely as a corporate entity to invest in a project where the government has an interest or not? Eighty-five percent said more likely.
So my point is, we're creating thousands and thousands and thousands of good-paying jobs. And the middle class is growing. And it's only now becoming clear.
I was asked earlier by a group of editors I met withnot editorscolumnists. And they said, ""Why are you talking about it now so much?"" A simple reason: We couldn't start it offwe started it off, we passed all this, but no one knows what it meant. None of it was happening. Now we have 35,000 infrastructure projects underwaybipartisan infrastructure projects.
Guess what? McConnell needed a bridge across the Ohio River. It cost a billion dollars to fix it$1 billion. But it affects the commerce of the entire Midwest area, so we're building a new bridge. I indicated I was going to be President for everybody, whether they voted for me or not.
You know, the point is that there's a lotfor example, I know I'm a big Amtrak guy. So I[inaudible]Amtrak, everybody kind of rolls their eyes. I get it. I've traveled 1,200,000 miles on Amtrak. Commuted every single day for 35 years.
Here's the point: If you think about it, there is a tunnel going through Baltimore underneath the bay there, and there's one in New York as well. Those tunnels arenothing has been done on one of them since 1906.
I'm probably the only non-Amtrak worker that's walked through that tunnel. There are lightbulbs hanging down. There's flooding going on. There is a lot of problems. You have to slow down to 30 miles an hour to go through there with the train.
We're fixing it. It's cost a lot of money, a billion dollars. But guess what? It's going to save billions of dollars because now you'll be able to go through it 100 miles an hour.
We learned one thing for surecertain: If in fact you could travel from point A to point B faster on a train than your vehicle, you leave your vehicle home. It has profound impact on dealing with the environment, which I'mthe last thing I'll mention. Oh, no, I won't; I'm going to get a question on the environment, so I'm going to wait on that. I think I'm getting a question about it.
Anyway, my point is, I am really optimistic. I'm optimistic about the notion that I think the AmericanI'm confident the American people are decent and honorable people. They've just been confused as hell.
And thereand when I made that speech when I was running in 2020 at theatup at thein Philadelphia, and II made the speech about democracy was at stake. And with all due respect to the press, they said, ""What the hell is he talking about that for?""by and large, notable exceptions. But, ""why is he talking about that?""
Well, guess what? Sixty-six percent of the American people agree with me. They're worried about theliterally, I'll end with thisdemocracy in America. What's happening? Not a joke. What's happening?
We talked about the Supreme Courtgreat news today. And there is great news. I think Roberts is beginning to have an impact on the close calls.
But think about what's happened, what we've done in terms of individual rightsindividual rights, everything from gayLBGTQ rights all the way through to rights relating to having an abortion. You know, I'm determined to bring back Roe v. Wade. And my objective to do that is to get the Stateshalf the States to decide that, because now the Court said, you know, it's State issue.
And the thing I love, they said, ""And we'll see what women can do."" They're going to find out. [Laughter] They're going to find out. But my point is, in addition to all this, the world is changing so rapidly. It's understandable why people are concerned.
Last point: The pandemicI think we're going to findand I wrote about this early ona profound impact on the psyche of the American people. A profound impact.
Mental health concerns are higher today than they've ever been in history of America. Look what's happening. Third graders are 7 to 18 months behind in their education. Across the board, schools, teacherslook, these guys wanted to cut 100,000 teachers in the negotiation that happened100,000 teachers. Try being a teacher in a classroom.
Did you ever think you'd live in a country where books are being banned? No, I'm not joking. ThinkI mean, think about the things that are happening.
So people are confused. We've got to let them know who we are. Let them know who we are, what we're for, and what we're against. And I think we'll be okay. But with that, I'm going toas my mother would say, ""Hush up, Joey."" And I understand I've got some questions coming.

Joseph R. Biden, Remarks at a Campaign Reception in Chevy Chase, Maryland Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/363468 "
2023-06-27 00:00:00,"Remarks at a Campaign Reception in Chevy Chase, Maryland","
The President. Well, folks, you know, I may step down there and talk so I can see you all. Look, I'll try to be relatively brief here.
Sandy and Stewart, you've been helping me for a long time, and helping me not only with your personal contributions, but you know, people make judgments about elected officials, in large part by the people who support them. I really mean it. It's all of you who have beenalmost every one of you have helped me in the past. Every one of you has been really generous.
And, by the way, I want you to meet the next United States Senator from the State of Delaware. Stand up, Congresswoman.
Our families are close. Her sister ran my office that got me reelected. Her father was first-team all-American in basketball. And he was with the ""Fabulous Five."" He is literally picked as one of the best ball players in history. He went to an all HBCU. They won the national championship back in the sixties. And her dad is an incredible guyincredible guy. But her mother has all the brains. Butall friends.
Look, folks, you know, there's a lot at stake, to state the obvious. And I want to make sure thatyou know, you've probably heard me say that I'm more optimistic about America today than I've ever been in my entire career. And that seems like a contradictory thing to say when so much wrongis going wrong in the country.
I wasI've met withwith Xi Jinping face to face more than any other world leader has. I've spent over 85 hours with him alone, 68 of which are in person. Back when I was Vicewhen I was Vice President, it was clear he was going to become the President. Barack could not spend the time with him. And so I was theI traveled 17,000 miles with him all across the world, including in China.
And we were on the Tibetan Plateau on one of our meetings, and he looked at me, and he said, ""Can you define America for me?"" And I said, ""Yes, I can, in one word."" And he looked at me. I said, ""Possibilities."" No, really.
Think about it. It's one of the reasons why a lot of other countries think we're the ""ugly Americans."" We think we can do anything.
There's never been anything we've set our mind to do as a country we haven't been able to eventuallynever, never. And there's so much at stake right now.
You know, when I was deciding whether or not to run again for officeand I had been out of office 4 years. I was a full professor at the University of Pennsylvania. They gave me a couple-million-dollar budget to hire personnel. I had people like Tony Blinken working for me.
[At this point, there was a brief microphone malfunction.]
Is this still working? There you go.
And I wasn't going to run again. Mymy son had just died. And what happened was: I wasI was watching the television one night, and I saw thewhat happened in Charlottesville, Virginia. And I saw, literally, people coming out of the woods carrying torchesout of the fieldsyou couldn't make this upcarrying Nazi flags and singing the same venomous antisemitic chants they sang in thirties in Germanyand accompanied by White supremacists and the Ku Klux Klan.
And a young woman was killed, a bystander, and I spoke to her mom. And when the outgoingthe existingthe sitting President said""What do you think, Mr. President, of what happened?"" He said, ""I think there were very fine people on both sides."" ""Very fine people on both sides.""
And I thought to myself, ""How can that possiblyhow could you possibly say that? How could you possiblybe so encouraging to White supremacists and Nazi sympathizersneo-Nazis?"" And so I decided I was going to run.
But then I realized how ugly it would be. And so I wasn't sure I wanted to put my kids through that, because I knew what would happen.
And so we have a tradition in our family, for real. Any child can ask for a family meeting. And I'm serious; we've had, since I've been alive, nine family meetings total. And they're taken seriously. Any child can ask for a family meeting, because if I asked for one, it's important.
And my kids and my grandkids asked if we could have a family meeting. And my granddaughter, who was then a senior at Columbia Law School, myanother granddaughter, who was a senior at the University of Pennsylvania, one was a juniora sophomore at Penn, and one was on her way there. And they asked for a meeting.
And my little grandson, who is now 18 years old, was, I guess, 9 years old or thereabouts.
And they said: ""Pop, we know it's going to be ugly. We know."" Being the son or daughter or granddaughter of a Senator, a Vice President, a President, and aor attorney general or a decorated war veteran like my son was, istheythey're used toeverybody thinks it's a great thing. But you get a lot of downside for that.
And so they made the case. Mymy grandkids: ""Daddy wants you to run. They know it'sand we know it's going to be tough.""
My little grandson, who was, I guesswell, how would he be then? He would have been probably 6 years7 years old. He took out his cell phone. He said: ""We know, Pop. It's going to be terrible.""
And he showed me a photograph on the interneta photographa photograph of me walking out of the church where my son just had a military service and aout on the way to the graveyard with my hand on ahand-draped [flag-draped; White House correction] casket with mywhere my son was being escorted.
And I used to always hold my grandsonmy son Beau. In church, I used towhen he would walkunder his chin, I'd letput my arm around him andand hold him. So I had my little grandson Hunter, his son, standing next to me, and I did the same thing. And the[inaudible]said, ""Biden molests another child."" And so he said, ""We know it's going to be ugly, Pop.""
And so I ran. And I ran for three reasons.
One, to restore the soul of this countrynot a joke, not a jokedecency, honor, being able to treat people with respect, not doing what we're doing.
Secondly was to rebuild the country from the middle out and the bottom up. Not thatI wasn't big on trickle-down economics, because I thinkI'm a capitalist. If you can make a million dollars or billion dollars, have at it. I really mean it. I support that. But everybodywhen you only trickwhen you think it's going to trickle down, not much trickled down on my dad's kitchen table.
So I've always been of a view that the way to build a country economically and reestablish our dynamism was to rebuild the middle class. And when you rebuild the middle class, the poor does very well and the wealthy still do very well.
And the third reason was[inaudible]unite the country. And you'll recall that's when the press justifiably said: ""Joe Biden is out of touch. He used to be able to do that; he had a reputation to be able to pull Democrats and Republic together, but you can't do it anymore. That time has passed.""
But I was convinced it could still happen.
So the end result was, when I got elected, I hired people with me who shareand by the way, my staff, including the campaign staff, didn't buy onto my reasons. I mean, they thought they were right, but they didn't think it was the way to run. The end result was, though, we were able to win.
And when we did, we put together a team on foreign policy and domestic policy, because I'm convincedI'm convinced that we can, in fact, unite this country in a way that it hadn't been united in a long, long time. And one of the things that I hadhad said[inaudible]we thought that we would be able to pull people together in variousboth in foreign policy and domestic policy.
Before I announcedbefore I decided to run, I started to write another book. And this book wasn't about my son. This book was about what was changing the world, how technology has changed the world. And I started off on the first chapter talking about the printing press and Gutenberg, how it fundamentally changed relations among countries. And I was going to work it all the way through wherewhat's happening now with AI and other things, which I don't know nearly as much about.
And so what happened was that I realized that I had to do something to demonstrate why we could be so good. And so one of the things we did in the foreign policyI was convinced, and still am, that the world is changing so rapidly, we have a chance to do things we could never do before.
Think about this: If anybody told youand my staff wasn't so sure, eitherthat we'd be able to bring all of Europe together in the onslaught on Iraq [Ukraine; White House correction] and get NATO to be completely united, I think they would have told you it's not likely. The one thing Putin counted on was being able to split NATO.
My staff has figured out I've spent 180 hours180 hours in direct contact with my friends in Europe and NATO members in the EU. And aboveof that, a lot of it was in person, but some of it was on Zoom.
And we've been able to hold the west togetherhold it together. That's the one thing that Putin thought he could do is break it. And he still thinks he can break it. But guess what's happened? By holding the West together on everything from North Africa all the way to dealing with what's going on in Europe, we've changed the dynamic.
And the idea thatfor example, II said I was going to go toto Japan to meet with the Prime Minister, because he would behe would change his views. And I spent a lot of time with him. And he didn't need my convincing as much as he'd already decidedfirst time Japan has increased their military budget significantly and got engaged in a European war, because he knew that if they didn't do that, it would send a green light about Taiwan and a number of other things. And he's gotten deeply involved.
I said something at a fundraiser earlier last week that was misleading. I didn't mean to be. And that was thatI said I convinced him to deal with South Korea. He told me he was going to work out something with South Korea, because of the World War II leftoverand he did. And then I stronglyhe asked me to strongly support it, which I did.
The idea that you havein the Far East, you havein the Pacific, you have Japan and South Korea working with United States, dealing with what's going on in Europe as well as the Taiwan Straits.
The idea we were able to put together a thing called the Quadthat is Indiaexcuse me, India, Japan, the United States, and Australiafundamentally changing security in the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea.
A whole range of things that are happeninga whole range of things that are happening around the world. And this is the first timeyou think of thisnone of you canIeven if you're as old as I am, you can't think of a time when the world was moving so rapidly in determining what their alliances were and where they were.
You probably saw my new best friend[laughter]thethe Prime Minister of a little country that's now the largest in the world, ChinaI mean, excuse me, India. India is not looking for a permanent alliance, but they're looking for some hedge againstin the region.
So my point is, the world is changing. And if you take a look at Africa and South Americaand Africa is going to have a billion peopleone billion people by 2033. And they have very little ability to deal with changing the infrastructure and growing their economies. And so we convinced our G-7 partners that we all should be doingwe're the ones that cause climate change. The west towe cut all our forest down. Weand so what are we doing to do to help Africa?
They needand by the way, China came in and said, ""We'll give you money to build your roads as long as you use Chinese workers and as long as you pay us a lot of money to allow us to dock our ships."" Well, guess what? That turned intoinstead of Belt and Road, it turns into a noose and debt. And so it's all changing.
We've convinced our colleaguesfor example, we're going to build a largestthe west is going to build the largest solar facility in the world in Angola. We're going to move toand we're going to havebuild the first transcontinental railroad across all of Africa. All of us are going to do that. Why? Some countries have the significant food resources. Some people have energy resources. There's no way they could share it even if they want to. None at all.
So my generic point is, the world is changing. In Latin America, the same way. Look what's happening in the Gulf. We're working like hell to deal with trying to generate support for democracy in the region.
And, for example, in Brazilthe Brazil rainforest absorbs more carbon out of the air than every ounce of carbon emitted from the United States on a yearly basis. We've got to preserve it. It costs a lot of money to preserve, but guess what? All those folks want to go in. And they have farmers, and they want to clear cut, they want to plant crops, et cetera.
So I'm trying to work with our allies around the world to provide them money not to do it. Pay them not to do it to give them opportunities to generate industries and all that.
I could go on, but the point is, the world is changing. It's changing. And we have an opportunity to send it in the right direction. We really do. And I think that's why I'm so excited aboutI know it's why I'm so excited about the prospects for the next 4 years and beyond, because we can change the dynamic of the world right now. It's within our power to have significantif we can keep our allies together and grow them.
And so the second thing is on the economy. When I was a kid in the Senate[laughter]I was 29 when I got elected. I had to wait 17 days to be sworn in.
But my point is that II sayas I said at the outsetand I'm going to make a speech on this in Chicago tomorrow: The Wall Street Journal andwhat was the other major publication? The Journal and one other major conservative publication referred to my economic plan as ""Bidenomics.""
And they've been very actually complimentary about it, because I was convinced, as I said, that we had to become the leader in the world in infrastructure. How can you be the leading nation in the world and have a second rate infrastructure? We're ranked number 9, 10, or 11whatever the hell it was. We used to be number one.
How in God's name could we be the leading country in the world when we have a circumstance where we don't havewe used to invest more in research and development than any nation in the world. And guess what? We used to have 2 percent of our GDP. Guess what? Now it[inaudible]seven-tenths of 1 percent of our GDP. So we changed that. We changed that by the legislation we passed.
How can we be in a position wheremy dad used to have an expression. He said, ""Joey, inflation is a real problem."" This is back when I was a kid. But it's notthe real question for middle class families and poor families says is: Is there anything left in your paycheck? Do you have any breathing room left in the paycheck?
My dad literallymy word as a Bidenmy dad used to say: ""Joey, your job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay' and mean it."" I swear to God, that was my dad, for real. For real.
And soand what happened? Well, we decided that we had to do something to give people a shot. And so what we did was, we changedweat the end of the day, inflationwe brought it down 11 months in a row. I hope it continues, but think about it. Major, major banks andand international finance organizations, they said, ""The recession is coming next month."" It's been coming for 11 months.
Well, guess what? I don't think it's going to come because we've never had as dynamic a growth in American historynevereven including Roosevelt's time. We havewe've created 13.6 million new jobs, 800,000 manufacturing jobs800,000 manufacturing jobs.
If you go onand so when you talk about what's happening in terms ofas my dad says, ""a little breathing room""more than one way to provide breathing room to deal with inflation. We're bringing inflation down and, God willing, we'll continue.
But here's the deal. At the end of the month, if you'rewhat are you worried about: the inflation going up as high as it's been or being able to pay your medical bills?
We paywe pay the highest prescription drug prices of any nation in the worldof any developed nation. The same company, making the same exact drug sold in Toronto or London or Paris or Bucharest is significantly cheaper. Why?
I was in Northern Virginia not long ago doing a town meeting, and a lovely woman stood up withalmost tears. And she said, ""I have two children with type 2 diabetes."" She said: ""Andand I need insulin. And I have a job, but my insurance won't cover that insulin. And I had to split it sometimes."" Talk about depriving a family of their dignity. Knowing you had to split the insulin and one of your kids may die. I mean, talk about the impact on a family.
And so I decided thatI've been fighting this for a long timeover 20 yearsit's about time that we were able to negotiate drug prices with the pharma companies.
For example, you know how much it costs to make that insulin? Tent-e-ndollars. Ten dollars is the actual cost. To package it, another $2. So now theythat insulin costs $35 instead of $400 per insulin shota month.
The point I'm making isand by the way, I evenoriginally when I wrote itit passed the Senateincluding everyone, not just the people on Medicare. Theymy friends on the Republican side knocked out the non-Medicare portion.
But the point is, I keepand when we were doing that settlement on trying to figure out how to keep us from going bankrupt as a nation for the first time in American history. Well, I said, ""Look""they said, ""We're not going to do anything having to do with taxes.""
And I said, ""Well, let me tell you something."" And they moved to eliminate this legislationeliminate all the legislation we passed. And I said, ""You know, it saves the country money."" I said: ""It saves the people who are onneed this insulin about 350 bucks a month per insulin shot. But it also saves the country $168 billion less being paid out.""
They looked to me. They said, ""How can""that's what it does, by the way, because theyour taxes are paying for that Medicare. And when you reduce the price of this whole project we havefor example, next year, we pick eight more drugs, and they negotiate the prices of those drugs. It's already in the law.
Well, guess what? They're trying to eliminate it again in their new legislation. They wanted to make sure they made fundamental changes in Social Security and Medicareeliminate a lot of it.
By the way, I never thought my third State of the Union Address would be negotiated on the floor of the United States Congress, but it worked. [Laughter] Remember when I said[applause]because I said, ""They want to cut Social Security and Medicare."" And they said: ""Liar! Liar!"" And I said, ""Okay."" I said, ""Everybody who thinks you want to cut it, raise your hand."" Silence. I said, ""Everybody who is opposed cuttingpromised not to cut it."" No one raised their hand. I said, ""Folks, you're on camera."" [Laughter]
But all kidding aside, so when you reduce pricesfor example, you all know about junk fees. The average American does. Now, you want to take your grandson or daughter to see your mom or dad andif they're still aliveor your mother or father to California to see them. And you have a child with you. Not until you get the ticket do you find out you paid about double for the ticket to have your child sit next to you.
Or, for exampleI don't want to insult anybody who is a banker here; there's a lot of good bankers. But guess what? Overdraft fees155$55 billion a year in overdraft fees.
There was one bankerI'm not going to mention his name; he's probably a good guyhe had a yacht called ""Overdraft."" [Laughter] As they say, ""Google it."" You'll see I'm telling you the truth. ""Overdraft."" Well, guess what? It sunk. [Laughter]
But my generic point is, these are the things that matter to ordinary peopleto ordinary people. And they're big numbers for ordinary people. When they find out all these extra costs that are hidden costs.
And my staff thought I was crazy. I think it's fair to say my staff didn't think it was such a great idea. Well, guess what? It's off the charts because people don't like being played for suckers. Whether you're wealthy, you're middle class, or you're poor, you don't like being played for a sucker.
My generic point is, those hidden fees are part of what people think is wrong with the country generally. They think they're being taken advantage of across the board, and they're not. They're not. So if you pick the ones that are the most egregious and eliminate them, it makes a big difference, in my view, in terms of public confidence, which leads me to
You know, I made a speech when I ran last timeand some of you were foolish enough to help me then, tooin New York City, at IndependentI mean in Philadelphia, at Independence Hall, on democracy being at stake. And I got roundly criticized by the press. ""What the hell is he talking about that for? Who cares?"" I mean, no one thinks thatnot everybody in the press, but a lot of criticism.
Well, guess what? Over 65 percent of the American people worry about democracy being at stake, for real. Think about it. How aboutdid you ever think we'd be in a position where not only 55 years of Roe v. Wade would be overruled, but then you have two Justices saying: ""And by the way, let's make it clear there is no right to privacy to who you marry. There's no right of privacy""and it goes down the whole list of things. Contraception. And when I said they're going to go after that, what's happening now in many States across the Nation? Outlawing contraception.
So I'myou know, I happen to be a practicing Catholic. I'm not big on abortion. But guess what? Roe v. Wade got it right. Roe v. Wade cut in a place where the vast majority of religions have reached agreement. Historically, the first 3 months or thereabouts, in all major religions, was: That's between a woman and her doctor. The next 3 months is betweenI mean, just a woman and her family. Next 3 months is between a woman and her doctor. The last 3 months have to be negotiated, because you can'tunless you are in a position where your physical health is at stakeyou can't do it.
And so, in addition to that, we found out that it used to be an accepted principle that rape and incest were exceptionswere exceptions to that rule. Look at the States that have changed the rules. Look at the States that have changed the rules. State legislatures. Did you ever think you'd see a day when you would not onlyforget your position on abortionbut were rape and incest were not even considered, number one? Couldn't be. And at the same time, we're in a situation where you werewe're banning books in schools, and not just anynot just the schoolboard; anybody can come in and call for the banning of a book.
I mean, this the United States of America, for God's sake. The United States of America.
And so there'sand one last thing: The rise of anti-Semitism in America is out of whack. Way out of whack. So I've set up a major Commission. I brought in all theall the groups into White House to focus on dealing withdealing with anti-Semitism.
But it's not just anti-Semites. Look what's happening in terms of the way women wearing a headscarfmost at-risk people in America. God love you, I'm so proud of you. No, nowe know each other. But I mean it.
But thinkthink about what's happening in the United States of America. Gun legislation. Gun legislation. I was the guy, along with Barbaraexcuse methe Senator from California who's about to retire, who got the assault weapons ban passed. And you know what? It worked. It drastically reduced the number of mass murders across the country. And there was a mass murder in every poor neighborhood in America every single day. And it fundamentally changed it.
Andbut I couldn't get it passed for more than 10 years. And we have to reauthorize it. And the Bush administration came along andboth Bushes are decent people, but they succumbed to theirto the gun lobby.
You know, they're the only major industry in America you cannot sue. It's[inaudible]law is the gun industry, gun manufacturing. Well, imagine if that had been the case with tobacco. How many thousand more people would be dead if we couldn't sue the tobacco companies?
And so I think we've got to change two changes. One, we have to once against assault weapon, which I'm going to get done come by hell or high water. And twotwo, we have to change the law[inaudible]. It doesn't mean that everything happens is their fault. But I found out, when I was up in[inaudible]up in Connecticutthe fact is that, as I'm toldI can't swear to this; I haven't verified it yetis that one of the reasons we'rethe gun manufacturers are so committed to the AR-15 is because it's the biggest moneymaker they have, and they sell more than any other weapon. The single biggest moneymaker they have.
And you know who they sell it to? They sell it to young people. They talk about: ""This is your manhood. This is what you""I mean, what's going on?
And the fact we don't have background checks that are universal, that you'recan walk in at 16, 17, 18 years old and buy a pistol in many States? Open carrythat's a real good idea. That's a real good idea.
My wife is a full-time school professor. They want schoolteachers to be able to be armed, as if that's going tonow, my wife might be able to shoot you.
But nobut all kidding aside, think about it. Think about what the hell we're doing. And think about the number ofI won't go through the detail with[inaudible]the number of mass murders that have occurred. The number. It'sI mean, it's at a historic high. We can stop it.
So there's two things we need to do. We have to outlaw assault weapons, and we have to outlaw magazines that can hold more than nine bullets. That's even too much. But I don't think I've beenby the way, in Delaware, we have a high rate of gun ownership because there's a lot of duck hunters, for real. That's why so manymostly shotguns.
But at any rate, I was going through trying to sell the assault weapons ban when I wasthe first time around as a Senator. So I'm walking through the Delawarethe Delaware-Maryland area has an awful lot of swamp area, all through theand I always kid Steny Hoyer and say, ""The best part of Maryland is in Delaware."" [Laughter]
But all kidding asidebut all kidding aside, I'm walking through and Iin Delaware. As the Congresswoman can tell you, it's hand to hand, they expect you tofor example, Pete du Pont was a very competent Governor and wanted to run against me for the Senate. They did a survey. ""Have you ever met Pete du Pont?"" Seventy-one percent of the people said yesor sixty-one. Seventy-four said they'd met me, and they said, ""Have you ever met them more than once?"" Fifty-eight percent said me. And 29 or 30 percent. I mean, no other State in America isit's all hand-to-hand combat in Delaware. [Laughter]
And so, anyway, I was walking through, and this guy said, ""You're going to take my damn gun from me, Biden?"" He was fishing. And I said, ""What""I said, ""What do you mean?"" He said, ""You going to take my gun away."" And I said, ""No, no, I'm just going to take your AR-15 away if you have one."" He said, ""Why are you doing that?"" I said, ""How many deer wear Kevlar vests out there?"" [Laughter] And he looked at me. No, I swear to God, true story.
Not only, I said, ""Well, what do you need something can shoot up to 200 rounds? Remember what happened in Colorado? Remember what happened?"" And he said, ""I don't."" And I said, ""Well, if you do, you're a hell of a lousy shot."" And he said, ""Damn""I won't say exactly what he said, but ""Damn, boy, you made a point.""
Because they're trying to make it seem like we're trying to take everybody's gun away. Not true. But we have to have some rational basis for gun ownership.
The last thing I think I'd like to mention to you is education. You know, my wife has an expression. And my wife nevershe never talked to a group of more than the size of her school ever. And now she's out talking to 8-, 10,000 people sometimes, because she's so committed.
And my point is this: She has an expression. She said, ""Any country that outeducates us will outcompete us."" Any country that outeducates us will outcompete us.""
And what's really even hurt education more is the pandemic. It's had a profound impact on the mental health of our children but also the loss of 6 monthsthe loss of 3 months in school is equivalent to losing a year and a half of education. All this data shows this is real.
And so I think we have to invest more in education. Rather than just having daycare centers, I think we should have pre-K at 3 years old.
What happens isall the studies have shown in the last 10 years, from Stanford to Harvard to Pennall the major universitiesUniversity of Virginia, et ceterahave done studies that show that no matter what home you come from, what background, if you start off learning reading, writing, arithmetic, and some version of that when you're 3 years old, you have a 57-percent better chance of going through all 12 years and on to maybe an apprenticeship or community college. That's significant. That is significant.
And by the way, I met with the Business Roundtable. And when I wasright when I was Vice President, the Secretary of Commerce was the sister of the Governor of California, a really brilliant woman. And we interviewed, by phone mostly, overI think it wasdon't hold me to the exact540 or 549 or -50 CEOs of the Fortune 500 companies and asked what's theirwhat's their major concern they have. You know what they say, the majority? A better educated workforce. And I said, ""Well, you're not helping much.""
And I pointed out that in the State of Delaware, which used to, when I started running, be called the ""State of DuPont""a very important family in the State. But the company was the eighth largest companycorporation in the world at the time; it's now number 81 or something like that.
But I said the DuPont company, when they buy a new enterprisewhich they were doing not infrequentlythey would educate that enterprise. They would educate those people. And I saidand I'd ask on the phone. I'd[inaudible]I said: ""You don't have to answer me, but do you educate your new employees? Do you educate them?"" Virtually nobody does anymore.
And I said, ""So why are you opposing my effort to have a better educated public?"" And it was silence on the phone most the time. And they changed their mind, the vast majority, because of the data that's coming in and what we can do.
And so I guess what I'm saying is, I think part of what we have to do is try to get away from the basic labelsthat ""Biden is a liberal"" or ""Biden is a right-winger,"" or ""Biden is whatever he is""and talk about the factsnot just Biden, but otherother of my colleagues, in both the House and the Senate and in other positions.
And I think we can get there. I really think we can get there because I thinkand I spoke with a couple of folks today, a couple of columnists, and I've spoken to some of the press. The idea thatthe idea that they think they're going to increase their standing by going right back at what I was able to brush offhaving them move away from, in terms of eliminating all the programs I've mentioned plus others, including Social Security and Medicare they're changing again, after promising they wouldn't, and agreeing in the agreement that we had relative to the debt ceiling.
And by the way, all the stuff that I've donewe've doneguess how much we'vehow much it's raised the debt. We've cut the debt $1.7 trillion. More than any President ever has.
And so we have a good story to tell, but we got to tell it. And I was asked by the press someI forget who asked me todaythat: ""Why are you just starting this extensive drive now?"" Well, the reason we're starting now is because no one knew what the hell we passed. No one knewthey knew we passed it. They thought the idea was good.
[An airplane flew overhead.]
That's Trump. He always flies over. [Laughter] I'm teasing. That's a bad joke. Bad joke.
But all kidding aside, think about it. WeI had to spend the firsteverybody told me I couldn't pass any of this stuff. We got it all. We got more major legislation passed than anybody since Roosevelt. I mean, for real. Fundamental changes in economic and foreign policynot because of mebecause I have great staff, and I got a lot of support.
But here's the second point. The second point is the reason I'm pushing it so hard now is, people know generically what's happened, and they think it's importantand overwhelming support for everything we passed by the publicbut they don't know what it means in their own home, in their own neighborhoods.
So, for example, if you ever take Amtrak to New York from here, well, guess what? You go through a tunnel that washadn't had anything done to it since 1907. I'm probably the only non-AmtrakI've traveled 1,200,000 miles on Amtrak, for real. Because Iafter my wife and daughter were killed, I didn't plan on staying. I started to commute.
And I had the dubious distinction of being listed as the poorest man in Congress for 38 years36 years. I didn't think I was poor. I hadI had a good Senate salary. I thought I was fine. But I was the poorest guy, literally.
And so I could not afford a house in Washington and in Wilmington, and I sold my houseI have a nice house in Wilmington. If I sold it, I'd be gone. If you leave Wilmingtonif you leave Delaware, you might as well forget it. Okay?
So one day we're getting on a train, and theand thewhen I was Vice President, and the Secret Service never liked me riding the train because it's more dangerous. You canyou know, they have 99 chance of doing something bad.
And so I'm getting on the train to go home and see my mom, who was living with me, who was dying. And I get in the train, and the guyI won't mention his name because I mentioned it last time, and he was so proud Ibut I didn't mention others, so I won't mention this time. And this guy walks up to meI've known from a time I wasstarted riding the train. He goes, ""Joey, baby!"" And grabs my cheek. And I thought Secret Service was going to shoot him. [Laughter] I said, ""No""I'm serious. Am I joking about how theymy friends in Amtrak?
I had picnics in my house for all the Amtrak conductors, because they were so damn good to me all the years. No, I really mean it.
He said: ""I just read in the paper: You traveled 1 million 100 thousand""or I think it was 1,100,000 miles""on Air Force planes."" We have to list everythey keep a record of every time we're in an Air Force plane. And he said, ""Big effing deal, Joey."" [Laughter]
And I saidI said, ""Ange, what's the problem?"" He said, ""Joey, we just had a retirement dinner up in Newark."" He said, ""And we checkedwe checked it out. You've traveled 1,200,000 miles."" [Laughter] I said, ""How'd you get that, Ange?"" He said: ""Well, we figured it out. You were in session about 117 days year-end average, times that by 36 years, then times the time as vice president. You've traveled over 1,200,000. I don't want to hear any more of this!"" [Laughter]
Well, everybody thinks every time I mention Amtrak I'myou knowbut we got $45 billion more for Amtrak[applause]because here's the deal: If you want to have an impact on the environment, get vehicles off the road.
And guess what? All the data showsnot a jokeif somebody can go from point A to point B on a railroad and get there quicker than they can in their car, theythey don't drive their car. They don't drive their car.
And so, for example, the Baltimore tunnel, it's going to cost a billion dollars to fix it. Had nothing been done to it since 1906, I think it was.
I'm probably the only non-Amtrak guy that's ever walked through that tunnel. For real. Walkedlight bulbs hanging from theyou know, likelike in acords in a light bulb hanging from the ceiling, flooding going on when it rains real hard. It's under the bay. Not floodingwipe out the track. But trains have to go through there, if my memory is correct now, at 30 miles an hour. And some of them aren't stopping in Baltimore; they're going through.
Well, guess what? We're fixing it for safety reasons, but in addition to that, you're going to be able to go through that tunnel at 100 miles an hour, fundamentally saving time. Same with New York. It's a lot of money. It's overgoing to becost a billion dollars out of theout of the fund we have forfor infrastructure.
But guess what? It's creating thousands of good-paying jobs, generating economic growth in downtown Baltimore.
And I said when I passed this legislation, I was going to be a President for all people, whether they voted for me or not.
Well, guess what? A guy I'm friendly with, we get on well, is the Senatorhe's smart as hellthe Senator from Kentucky, Mitch Landrieu. They've been trying to fix that bridge forever
[The audio was briefly distorted.]
walls going to collapse. And you see the bridge collapses that are going on? Okay. And guess what it cost to rebuild that bridge: close to $1 billion.
More rail traffic and more truck traffic goes over that bridge than almost any bridge in the country, and it connects an entire economic system going all the way down to Florida. Well, we're going to build it. We're going to build it. Again, it's going to be a boom for Kentucky and Missouri, but that's a good thing, not a bad thing.
And so I guess my point is this: The reason we're doing what we're doing now is letting people know exactly what's happening, what's going to happen.
We had an event yesterdayand I'll end with this. We're replacing every single, solitary lead pipe in America. Hear me? Children arefewer children are going to die and have mental illness. Every single lead pipe to the houseto the houseit costs them money. And we're going to make sure they havethose lead pipes are fixed.
In addition to that, we announced yesterday we're spending billions of dollars for high-speed internet that's cheap. And it's going to fundamentally change what happens in communities.
In many communities, you can't evenhow many people you'veyou've heard that work for you said, ""I had to stop at McDonald's with my kid to do their homework so I could pick up the internet""? I'm being deadly earnest.
How many farmers without access to internet know when the best time to sell their cattle is or their crop? They have to rely on the big conglomerates.
So it's going to fundamentally change how we think of ourselves. And it's going to up the ability of ordinary families to have access to more information and grow.
So the only point I'm making is, there is a lot we're doing. And we still cut the deficit by $1.7 billion, doing every one of these things. And I think if the Republicanand by the way, this is not your father's Republican Party. A lot of really good Republicans I've worked with. I've had seven of themthe press heard me say thisindividuallywell, in one case, two came to me, but in the other case, one at a timeI promised I'd never say their names, and I'll go to my grave without mentioning itsaying, ""Joe, I agree with you""I give my word""I agree with you, Joe. But if Iif I join you, they'll primary, and I'm going to lose my election. I'll lose my election."" Not a statement of courage, but a statement of reality.
So we've got to change all of this. And I think we're in the process of doing it, because I only have faith in the American people.
You know, I'm always quoting Irish poets on the floor of the Senate, and they always kid me about it, and they thought I was doing it because I'm Irish. It's not the reason. They're the best poets in the world. [Laughter]
And there's a guy named Seamus Heaney. I've become friends with his wife. HeI just knew him vaguely. And he wrote a poem called ""The Cure at Troy."" And the line in the poem goeshe said: ""All is changed, changed utterly. A terrible beauty has been born."" All has changed, internationally and nationally. And we canI am more optimistic about our ability to control everything from the environment to all the things we're talking about and put them in a better place than before.
I reallyI honest to God believe it. And I knowand the one thing I can say: I've been around longer than anybody. I don't brag about that very often. But all kidding aside, I think we can do great things. I really do. I really do.
And so, with your help, I hope to be able to do that. And you're helpingby the way, the money raised here is significant. You're helping a great deal. I want to thank our host and all of you. And many of you, it's a second or third time. You've got to blame yourself now, not me. [Laughter]
But youbut you knowanyway, thank you, thank you, thank you.
[Music began to play.]
White House aide. We have closed the roads[inaudible].
The President. Last thing. If I don't leave, we lose thousands of votes. You think I'm joking? We set a time when we comewe have to give the local officials a time we are going to be leaving on the road. Since I've become President, a lot different thanI had lunch with Barack today, who was helping me. It wasand he was remarking how much heI have 80-something vehicles that follow me. [Laughter]
And I used to think we hadwe had traffic problems on the highway. I don't know what the hell is the matter. We have no problems. [Laughter] None at all. But we also make a hell of a lot of people mad if we don't get going, because they'rethey block the roads beginning now.
So thank you, thank you, thank you. And thank you, Mr. Ambassador.

2023-06-26 00:00:00,Remarks on Broadband Infrastructure Improvement Efforts and an Exchange With Reporters,"
The President. Please. Thank you. Thank you. Please. Thank you.
Although I like the fact Joe Manchin is standing all this time. [Laughter] He's a friend. Hi, Joe Joe. How are you, pal?
Sen. Joseph A. Manchin III. Fine.
Situation in Russia/Ukraine 
Before I begin, let me say a few words about the events in Russia. And excuse me, I'm a littleI have an allergy.
[At this point, the President cleared his throat.]
The situation began to develop as it didI directed my national security team to monitor it closely and to report to me hour by hour. I instructed them to prepare for a range of scenarios.
I also convened our key allies on a Zoom call to make sure we were all on the same page. It's critical that we're incoordinated in our response and coordinated in whatto anticipate. We agreethey agreed with me that we had to make sure we gave Putin no excuselet me emphasizewe gave Putin no excuse to blame this on the West or to blame this on NATO.
We made clear that we were not involved. We had nothing to do with it. This was part of a struggle within the Russian system.
I also talked at length with President Zelenskyy of Ukraine. I'll be keeping in contact with him. I may be speaking with him later today or earlier tomorrow morning to make sure we continue to remain on the same page.
I told him that no matter what happened in Russialet me say it againno matter what happened in Russia, we, the United States, would continue to support Ukraine's defense and its sovereignty and its territorial integrity. He and I agreed to follow up and stay in constant contact.
I'm also in constant contact with our allies to maintain our coordination. I'll be speaking with a head of state right after this meeting today and making sure we're on the same page. I didn't get a chance to speak with one head of state yesterday.
We're going to keep assessing the fallout of this weekend's events and the implications for Russia and Ukraine, but it's still too early to reach a definitive conclusion about where this is going. The ultimate outcome of all this remains to be seen.
But no matter what comes next, I will keep making sure that our allies and our partners are closely aligned in how we are reading and responding to the situation. It's important we stay completely coordinated.
Broadband Infrastructure Improvement Efforts 
And now I'd like to turn to today's announcement and begin by asking a question: Did you lay all that cable? [Laughter] She's a Wonder Woman. [Laughter] I was watching in the other room. But I didn't realizeI didn't bring along all the cableIyou know, the empty spools. [Laughter] You're incredible. Thank you.
Look, I want to thank you, Jeff, for taking the time, and thank you for the introduction. There you are.
And I want to thank Kamala, who is there for every single important thing we do, and I'm not sure how we'd do it without her.
Two years ago, I asked her to lead an effort into high-speed internet, and she's been doing an incredible job since then.
So is GinaGina Raimondo, our Commerce Secretary. And Shalanda Young, who is a jack of all trades, sitting here with our Office of Management and Budget. She's played a major role along with Mitch Landrieu, in ouron our Infrastructure Coordinator.
And I want to thankand I mean it sincerelyJoe Manchin of West Virginia, who is here with us today as well.
And thank you to the leaders of State and local governments, labor unions, Tribal organizations, and telecom companies.
Folks, we're talking today about a major investment that we're making in affordable, high-speed internet all across the country. As we started down, I turned to Jeff, and I said, ""You know, this may beI wonder if President Roosevelt felt a little like this as he talked about the electrification of our farmlands."" I mean, think about it. This isit's almost similar.
Thebut to put in context, let's remember where we were 2 years ago. The pandemic was raging. The economy was reeling. And the problems we were facing started a lot earlier than that.
For decadesfor decadesand the middle class was hollowed out. Too many good-paying manufacturing jobs moved overseas. Public investment was slashed. Core sources of our economic strength, like infrastructure, manufacturing, and innovation, were also hollowed out.
All that is a result of a failed economic policy that I call trickle-down economicsit was called ""trickle-down economics"" as wella belief that we should give tax cuts to the wealthy and big corporations and expect it to trickle down to everyone else, benefit across the board.
I ran for President with a fundamentally different vision: to build the economy from the middle out and the bottom up instead of the top down; to grow the economy by educating and empowering workers, by promoting competition to support small businesses, and investing in ourselves again for the first time in a long time. And that's what today's announcement is all about.
You know, what we're doing is, as I said, not unlike what Franklin Delano Roosevelt did when he brought electricity to nearly every American home and farm in our Nation. Today Kamala and I are making an equally historic investment to connect everyone in Americaeveryone in America to high-speed internet byand affordable high-speed internetby 2030.
It's the biggest investment in high-speed internet ever, because for today's economy to work for everyone, internet access is just as important as electricity was or water or other basic services. Think of the parents and students sitting outside of McDonald's or outside your office to be able to get on the internet, in a parking lot just so their child can go online to do their homework.
We just heard from Jeff who has to drive his kids all over town to find a good internet connection. But he's not alone in that; there are thousands of Americans doing the same thing. Or small-business owners who are not able to reach more customers; or seniors unable to talk to their doctor through telemedicine.
For around 24 million Americans across this country, there is no high-speed internet. And for millions more, their internet connection is limited or unreliable. High-speed internet isn't a luxury anymore, it's become an absolute necessity. That's why we acted as soon as we didas soon as we came to officewith the American Rescue Plan.
It included $25 billion$25 billionfor high-speed internet in places where it was out of reach, for schools and libraries to help students connect to the internet if they couldn't do it at home.
After that, we signed the bipartisan infrastructure law, a once-in-a-generation investment to rebuild roads, bridges, ports, airports, and deliver water and high-speed internet to every American. And again, Joe, thank you for your help on that.
To date, over 35,000 projects are either funded or already underway across the country thanks to that law. This includes hundreds of high-speed internet projects in rural and Tribal communities.
Butbut, but, butit's not enough to have access. You need affordability in addition to access. That's why we worked with internet service providers to bring down prices for Americans struggling with internet payments. It's called the Affordable Connectivity Program. It's helping 19 million families save around $30 a month on their internet bills, and some save a lot more.
These savings matters in homes like the one I grew up in. That's money that can go for groceries, for the electric bill, for other things and other necessities.
Kamala has traveled across the country, working with State and local officials, to make sure people know about this program. And several groups and companies here today have helped millions of Americans sign up through the ""Online For All"" campaign. ""Online For All"" campaign.
Now, we're working with Congress to extend thethis bipartisan program.
For folks looking for an affordable internet banplan, just go to getinternet.govgetinternet.gov.
And today we're taking another big step toward internet for all. We're announcing over $40 billion to be distributed to 50 States, Washington, DC, and territories to deliver high-speed internet in places where there's neither service or it's too slow.
And, folks, it includes rural communities like Appalachia, towns that Joe represents. It includes Tribal lands from Alaska to the Dakotas, coastal towns from Hawaii to the Pacific Northwest. It also includes suburban communities, even cities, neighborhoods, andwhere there's a lot of peopleyou think it's automatic, but some still have to use dial-up connections to get online.
The funding for each State and Territory is based on their specific needs, how many of their residents currently lack internet access, and what it will cost to provide that access. With this funding, along with other Federal investments, we're going to be able to connect every person in America to reliable high-speed internet by 2030.
I promised to be a President for all Americans, whether or not they voted for me or whether or not they voted for these laws. These investments will help all Americans. We're not going to leave anyone behind.
Don't just take it from me. I've gotten letters and e-mails from across the country from people who are thrilled that after so many years for waiting, they're finally going to get high-speed internet.
A woman named Beth wrote me from Iowa. She lives in a valley that's a dead zone to cellto cell reception. She's also gotten internet via satellite, which goes out when it rains or snows. She can't get emergency alerts. Even in good weather, it's spotty.
Then, last year, a local telecom company with just 13 employees sent Beth a postcard. They had received funding from the American Rescue Plan. Now they were installing fiber optic cable for homes like hers in the valley.
And here's what she wrote to me, and I quote, ""You can imagine my joy."" She called them right away. And the next day, they sent someone out to survey her yard. As Beth wrote, ""This is the best thing that has happened to rural America since the Rural Electrification Act brought electricity to farms in the thirties and forties."" End of quote.
Folksplus, this investment means something else as well: good-paying jobs. Good-paying jobs. Just ask the folks at the IBEW or the Communication Workers or the Laborers Union. They're putting thousands of people to work laying fiber optic cable across America.
And the cable will be made in America. Let me say that again: The cable is going to be made in America. And that also means good-paying manufacturing jobs. It matters.
Folks, here's the bottom line. By investing in America, we are delivering results. More than 13 million jobs created since I took office. Nearly 800,000 manufacturing jobs. As alla lot of folks are tired of hearing me say it: Where in God's name is it written that we can't be the leading manufacturer in the world again? Where is that written?
You know, since I've been in office, we've attracted $490 billion$490 billionin private investment in new manufacturing like semiconductors, electric vehicles, batteries, fiber optic cable and we're talking aboutthat we're talking about here today.
More people are starting small businesses than ever. And everyone who applies for a small-business line is a sign of hope.
All told, this is the strongest, fastest economic growth anywhere in the worldin the world. Jobs are back. Manufacturing is back.
And in many places that have been left behind, pride is coming back as well.
You know, a lot of us lived in communities where they had thriving manufacturing bases and, seeking cheaper jobs, moved overseas. Not only did you lose the jobs, but guess what happened? You lost pride in that neighborhoodthat neighborhoodthat you came from. Everybody knew they worked at the steel mill. They worked at theirthey worked whatever it was. In my case, it was coal mines and then steel.
And, folks, let me close with this. Connecting everyone to Americain America to affordable, reliable high-speed internet is a bold goal, but we're a great nation. Especially one as vast and geographically diverse as ours, it's even bolder.
You know, we are all well on our way. We're just going to have to keep it going.
And, as it was mentioned earlier, just remember, it's never been a good idea to bet against America. And let's remember who we are. We're the United States of America. There is nothing beyond our capacity.
May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you for coming.

2023-06-23 00:00:00,Remarks With Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India in a Meeting With Technology Industry Leaders,"
President Biden. Okay. WeI was just thanking theanyway, I started off without you, and I sold a lot of state secrets and a lot of very important things that we shared. [Laughter]
No, all kidding aside[laughter]look, we're teaming up to design and develop new technologies that are going to transform the lives of our people around the world. And together, we're lifting the private and public partners to make this possible, including launching a new program between India and AmericaAmerican astronauts, Indian astronauts, and entrepreneurs, scientists, students.
Simply put, our countries are taking innovation and cooperation to a new level in our relationship, and thanks in large part to the folks around this table. So my message today is really simple: We've got to keep it up, and we have to make sure we aim even higher.
We're going to see more technological changeyou've heard me say this a number of timesin the next 10 years than we saw in the last 50 yearsand maybe in the next few yearsthe last 50 years. And we need your helpand I'm talking to the CEOs around this table, Indian and American. We need your help to seize the moment, to help manage the risk to our societies, our economies, and to our nations' national security.
We need your help to build guardrails around emerging technologies so that they're trustworthy, they're secure, and uphold our shared value and human rights. We need you to help us expand our partnership into new fields, in biotechnology as well as quantum.
You know, as you all know well, innovation and collaboration are rarely without obstacles. And so you raise our ambitions, and I want you to let us know what stands in the way of our ambitions as well and be straight with us.
The speed bumps are impeding technological partnershipwhat they are, when they occurso the Prime Minister and I can commit to building around them, over them, and through them. Because it mattersour cooperation mattersnot just to our own people but, I quite frankly think, to the whole world.
Because our partnership is about more than the next breakthrough or the next deal andas big as they may be. It's about taking climate changeit's about tackling it. It's about exploring the universe. It's about lifting people out of poverty; curing cancer and other serious diseases; preventing pandemics; and giving our citizensall our citizensreal opportunity. And aboutit's about forging a more free, secure, and more prosperous future for our children, supporting the dynamism and diversity of our democracies and democracies everywhere.
We're sticking up for our values and the vision of ourvision of the world. And so our partnership between India and the United States will go a long way, in my view, to define what the 21st century looks like. And our technology and technological cooperation will be a big part of defining our partnershipour partnership.
So I look forward to continuing working with all of you andon our voyage of discovery, as was referenced, and to building a better future. And I want to thank all the CEOs, again, for being here. And with that, I'm going to turn it over to the Prime Minister to say nice things about me. [Laughter]
Prime Minister Modi. President Biden, and all friends here: In a way, sayingsometimes, it's a little difficult to say too much in front of all the press present here.
But first of all, I would like to thank President Biden for participating in this event. And you have seen that from agriculture to space, there are all the sectors represented here that touch our lives in every way. And technology is something that touches our lives, and all technology sectors are represented here.
And there are well-established firms here and startups here as well. And both of them can work toare working together to create a new world. And I'm very pleased that under the leadership of President Biden, technologyunderstanding the importance of technology, the progress that America has made in the area of technology. And the youth in India, thanks to its talent, has created an identity for itself in the world. So this coming together of talent and technology, I believe this is definitely a guarantee for a bright future.
This morning the discussion we've had with just a few friendsbut this morning is with usgiving us a guarantee for a bright future. And this is a very small group of people, but this is a very promising group, a wonderful group, and one which is going to give direction to the world, which is going to build the future of the world.
And with the resolve for a better future, the vision of President Biden, the aspirations of India, the strength that President Biden has and the possibilities that India represents, we have an opportunity to take this forward.
And therefore, I would like to congratulate my friend, Secretary Raimondo. She visited India. She took out a lot of time for India. And what she herself experienced there and what she brought is taking forward here, and I can never thank President Biden enough. And I thank you all very much.
President Biden. Well, thank you very much. Thank you for coming in, folks. We ask the press to leave now. Thank you.

2023-06-23 00:00:00,Remarks at a Campaign Event With Reproductive Rights Organizations,"
The President. Jill said you women should take off your high heels, or else you should just lie down. [Laughter] My lord, talk about commitment, standing all this time. [Laughter]
Thank you, Doc. I appreciate that introduction. I really do.
My name is Joe Biden. I'm Jill's husband and Kamala's running mate. [Laughter] You all think I'm kidding. I want to thankstart by thanking Kamala for taking the lead on this issue and so many other issues in our campaign and our governing. And I want to thank Jill and Doug for their work in shining a spotlight on the issue affecting women.
And I want to thank all of youEMILYs List, NARAL, Planned Parenthoodfor your endorsement. It's a big deal. It's a big deal. Your support was critical last time around, and we're so grateful for it and we're hard working with you again.
I can't think of three organizations who will do morehave more consequential impact on the right and the ability to regain freedom. You know, you have troops on the ground in every single State, and we're going to need all those troops in those States.
We want to thank Nancy Pelosi, a good friend, who's been an ally and friend of mine for a long time, as well as the many Members of the Congress who are here and elected officials from all around the country.
To state the obviousand though it's clear by now; it's almost redundant to say itthis fight really matters. It really, really matters. Since the day the Dobbs decision came down 1 year ago tomorrow, we've seen the devastating effects all across the country: women turned away from emergency rooms, denied lifesaving care; moms, college students, teachers, nurses traveling hundreds of miles to get basic reproductive health care.
And we just heard from Jill, who's heard the stories firsthand. You know, we've all heard the stories firsthand. People come up to youpeople we've known and people we've grown up with. You know, and since that dark June day last year, each of you has worked tirelessly to fight back.
In the Dobbs decision, the Court particularlypractically dared the women of America to be heard. This is what the majority wrote: ""Women are not without electoral or political power."" You ain't seen nothing yet, Court. [Applause] No, I really mean it. Think of the challenge that is.
I said at the time that I didn't think the Courtor, for that matter, the Republican Party, who for decades have pushed their extreme agendahave any clue about the power of women in America. I said they were about to find out. And by the way, in the midterms, we were supposed to be blown out. They did find out. And they're going to find out again. I really believein my heart, I believe it.
Look, we were criticized for making this an issue in the midterms. In fact, I got attacked for it. But you know, all along, what Kamala and Doug and Jill and I knew as well: The Americans would not stand by and let the Court take away the right that's so fundamental, that we'd fightwe'd fightto restore these protections of Roe v. Wade and make it the law of the land once again. And we're going to do that. And we will not let the most personal decisions fall in the hands of politicians instead of woman and their doctors.
The Court was betting that all of us would remain silent. But my mother had an expression. She said: ""Joey, never bow, never bend, never yield. Just get up."" [Applause] Oh, you think I'm kidding? You didn't know my mom. [Laughter]
That the Americanthat the women of America would remain silent was just beyond comprehension; that Kamala and I would remain silent. Well, we're not. We will not remain silent.
And all over this country, thanks to the hard work of the voters, delivered a clear message. In Kansas, in Michigan, in Kentucky, in the polls in November, Americans voted to protect the woman's right to choose. In fact, you all showed up and beat the hell out of them. [Laughter] No[applause].
And what's really remarkable is despite the will of the American people, MAGA Republicans have made clear that they don't intend to stop with the Dobbs decision. No, they won't, until they get a national ban on abortion. Speaker McCarthy said, quote, ""Our work is far from done."" End of quote. Senator Lindsey Graham wants to
Audience members. Boo!
The President. wants to criminalize doctors and nurses who provide medical care for their patients; make it a crime. Republicans in Congress have proposed three national abortion bans just this last year. Well, make no mistake about it: If somehow Congress were to pass a national ban, I will veto it.
Let's also be clear that this decision also risks the broader rights of privacy for everyone. That's because the fundamental right to privacy, which Roe recognized, has served as a basis for so many other rights that are ingrained in our fabric of our country: the right to make the best decisions for your health, the right to use birth control. Did you ever think we'd be arguing about that?
Audience members. No!
The President. No, I'm serious.
The right to marry the person you love.
Judge Thomas said as much in his concurring opinion in Dobbs, writing, quote, ""For that reason, in future cases we should reconsider all the Court's substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell.""
These guys are serious, man. I said it when the decision came out, and people looked at me like I was exaggerating. But they're not stopping here. Make no mistake, this election is about freedom on the ballot once again.
Look, we've made so much progress. We can't let it take us backwards. I believe that one of the best ways to continue making progress is to ensure women are at every table where every decision is made. And that's not hyperbole. That's not hyperbole.
I promised that my administration would look like America. My Cabinet is the first majority-female Cabinet in history. You just heard from the first woman ever Vice President of the United States. And perhaps the most critical of milestones we mark tomorrow. We are reshaping our courts. We've appointed more Black women to the Federal Circuit Courts of Appeal[applause]than every other President in American history combined. Combined.
And of course, I was proud to keep my promise to appoint Justice Jackson the first Black woman to the Supreme Court. And by the way, she's smarter than the rest. [Laughter] She isI'm serious. She's incredible. She is genuinely incredible.
We're also making progress building an economy where all Americans have the opportunity to work, raise a family, buy a home, start a business. We made historic investments in childcare, making it more affordable so parents can work and provide for their kids at the same time.
The first major piece of legislation I signed, the American Rescue Plan, provided historic tax relief for millions of families, helping to recover childcare costs through the largest increase in history of childcare tax credit and the dependentthe dependent care childtax credit.
We helped 200,000 children care providers stay open and small businesses continuing to go through the pandemic and continuing to serve more than 9.5 million children. These things matter.
I signed legislation increasing funding for childcare and development block grants by 30 percent, helping low-income families afford childcare. But there's so much more to do. And we're fighting over abortion?
For example, the United States is still one of the only countries in the world that doesn't guarantee paid leave. I remain committed to changing that and bringing us in line with every other single major economy in the world by passing a national program for paid leave and medical leave.
We can get all this done and so much more. We can restore the protections of Roe v. Wade and make it the law of the land again, but we're going to need your help badly. So let me ask you this: Do you think your colleagues are with us?
Audience members. Yes!
The President. Well, I tell you what, they'd better damn well be. [Laughter]
After the Dobbs decision came down, I signed two Executive orders, and my administration took a number of actions to protect the access to reproductive health care.
And it's justthe one I signedthe third Executive order, which is to strengthen the affordability of high-quality contraception. The idea that I had to do thatI meanno, I mean, really, think about. Think about it.
I know I'm 198 years old[laughter]but all kidding aside, think about that. I never ever thought I'd be signing an Executive order protecting the right to contraception. But the only sure way to protect a woman's health and rights is for Congress to pass a law.
As I've said before, the Court got Roe right 50 years ago, and I believe Congress should restore the protections of Roe v. Wade once and for all. But we need your help. So I'll ask again: Are you with us? You're going to get this done? I really mean it.
So let me closelet me close with this.
Over the last week or so, we've seen extraordinary support from three of the most important voices in the country coming together to get behind this campaign: organized labor, climate leaders, and all of you representing the powerful groups fighting to protect the advantage for women's rights.
Your strong support, your determination, your advocacy are why I've neverI know I've said this before, and I want you to listen to it again, and I mean it from the bottom of my heart: I have never been more optimistic about America's future than I am today.
And with your help, Kamala and I are going to continue to make the progress. We're going to finish this job.
We just have to remember who the hell we are. We're the United States of America. And there's nothing, nothing beyond ourif we work together.
So God bless you all. May God protect our troops.
Let's go get this done. Let's get this done! Thank you.

2023-06-22 00:00:00,Remarks at a State Dinner Honoring Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India,"
President Biden. Welcome to Prime Minister Modi's Washington home. [Laughter]
I've been doing thisplease have a seat. I've been doing this a long time, but I don't ever remember anybody getting a warmer welcome[laughter]than this man right here.
Prime Minister Modi. Thank you.
President Biden. Good evening, everybody.
Twenty years ago, as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I made clear that the United States and India grew to be the closest friends and partners in the world, the world would be a safer place. I believe that even more today now that I'm President.
Mr. Prime Minister, Jill and I have had a wonderful time with you today during your truly productive visit. And tonight it's fittinga fitting way to celebrate the great bonds of friendship between India and the United States that will long endure.
As many of you know, these bonds stretch back to America's earliest days. In 1792, our first President, George Washington, established one of the first consulates in Kolkata, nestled along the Bay of Bengal, a hub of commerce and culture, home to more Nobel laureates, I might note, than any other Indian city, including the great poet-philosopher Tagore. And he wrote two national anthems, India and Bangladesh, and influenced great American thinkers as well.
Over a hundred years ago, Tagore sent his son to a college here in America. During his visit here, he traveled the country. And of the wisdom, he saidand he wrote in his life, ""In the bustle of all our work, there comes this cry: Take me across and where the mind is without fear, where the mind is led forward to ever-widening thought and actions into that heaven of freedom,"" end of quote.
As two great democracies in the bustle of our work, India and the United States hear the cry and the call of destiny to take our nations in the world forward to a future worthy of our dreamsa future of greater prosperity, opportunity, liberty, equality for all, and for the good of the world. Because it's only when every person can grasp their fullest potential that we as nations can achieve our highest purpose.
And may we always remember that it's our peopleour peoplethat give our partnership strength. From all the backgrounds and beliefs, they inspire us, challenge us, tell us the truth, and push us forward. They're the reason our democracies endure, evolve, reflect, and renew, generation after generation.
I've seen in my visits to India, and I see in the diaspora here in Americain the arts, education; in the media, law, medicine, and science, and businessbusinesses of every size; in spelling bee champions[laughter]even in cricket clubs across the country, including back in my home State of Delaware; and a record number of Indian Americans in Congress, who are here tonightRo, Ami, Raja, Shri, Pramila, and you knowwell, I won't go on. [Laughter]
I have a great working relationship with all of you. In fact, after her critical leadership on one of the legislative victories, I called Congresswoman Jayapal's mother in India to thank her and wishing her happy Diwali. It was an incredible moment. I think she wondered, ""Who in God's name is calling me?"" [Laughter]
As I said this morning, we see the pride of the community in our incredible Vice President. Thank you, Kamala. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Mr. Prime Ministeroh, I better get that translated.
[At this point, President Biden paused while his remarks were translated into Hindi by an interpreter. He then continued his remarks as follows.]
Mr. Prime Minister, thank you for your partnership and your friendship. And to allto allplease join me in a toast, but I don't know if we have any glasses. [Laughter] Please join me in a toast. Here it comes. The good news for both of us: Neither of us drink. [Laughter]
[A White House aide handed glasses to President Biden and Prime Minister Modi. President Biden briefly addressed the aide as follows.]
That is what? Ginger ale? Okay. [Laughter]
Mr. Prime Minister, I had an Irish grandfather named Ambrose Finnegan. And he used to say that when you give a toast and you don't have any alcohol in your glass, you must do it with your left hand. [Laughter] You think I'm kidding? I'm not. [Laughter]
[An interpreter began to translate President Biden's remarks into Hindi.]
President Biden. That wasn't in the script. [Laughter]
[The interpreter continued the translation, and President Biden then continued his remarks as follows.]
A toast to our partnership, to our people, to the possibilities that lie ahead, to two great friends, two great nations, and two great powers. Cheers.
[President Biden offered a toast.]
The floor is yours.
[Prime Minister Modi spoke in Hindi, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
Prime Minister Modi. President Biden, First Lady Dr. Jill Biden, distinguished guests: Good evening.
First of all, I thank President Biden for this wonderful dinner today. My special thanks to Dr. Jill Biden for her personal efforts and attention in making my visit a success. I would also like to express my gratitude to her for the magnificent organization of today's event.
Yesterday evening, you opened the doors of your house to me. I'm deeply grateful to you for this special gesture, for your friendship and warm hospitality.
I know your hospitality has moved your guests to sing. I wish I too had the singing talent. [Laughter] I would have also sung before you all. [Laughter]
Mr. President, this evening is made special by the presence of the people of our two countries, bringing the values of democracy and diversity to life. They are our most precious assets.
When we met in Japan for the Quad Summit, you mentioned a problem that you were facing. Well, looking at the vast experience of your long public life, I'm sure that you must have resolved the problem. I hope you were able to fit in everyone who wanted to come to dinner tonight. [Laughter]
You gathered a group of exceptionally talented and remarkable people tonight. I must commend you for that. All these people symbolize so much about the India-U.S. relations: our energy, our dynamism, and our potential.
Indian Americans have come a long way in the U.S. They are proud of India's values, democratic traditions, and culture and have always found a respectful place in America's melting pot. Indian Americans have played a significant role in further strengthening the inclusive society and economy of the U.S.
Be it hospitals or hotels, universities or research labs, gas stations or logistics, management or IT, they are making their mark everywhere. [Laughter] And now some of them are even in the White House. [Laughter]
With every passing day, Indians and Americans are getting to know each other better. We can pronounce each other's names correctly. We can understand each other's accent better. Kids in India become Spider-Man on Halloween. [Laughter] And America's youth is dancing to the tune of ""Naatu Naatu."" [Laughter]
Amidst the love for baseball, cricket is also getting popular in the U.S. The American team is trying its best to qualify for the Cricket World Cup to be held in India later this year. I wish them good luck and success. [Laughter]
Mr. President, for over five decades, through all the sweeping changes in the world, you've worked hard in the service of your nation and the entire humanity. You've turned every adversity into strength, loss into resolve, challenge into a mission.
I first met you nearly a decade ago when you were the Vice President, and I see the same commitment and intensity even today in you. You are soft spoken, but when it comes to action, you are very strong.
And I know that as an educationist, Dr. Jill Biden has made a tremendous contribution in this journey.
Friends, President Biden and I had some very wide ranging and deep conversations today. I think our teams got tired of taking notes. [Laughter] And yet it felt like we were running out of time. I don't want to speak too much about India-U.S. relations, because I know this is my fifth speech for the day, or maybe it's the sixth. As you can see, I really have lost count. [Laughter]
Mr. President, in 2014, when you had hosted a banquet for me, at that time I was observing a 9-day religious fast. And I remember you were asking me and asking me again and again what I could eat during my fast. [Laughter] But it was not possible for me to eat anything, and you were quite concerned about it. Well, today I'm making up for it. All that you desired at that time with so much affection is being fulfilled today. [Laughter]
I know everybody is eager to have dinner, looking at today's special menu. I know the effort made by Dr. Biden in very delicately curating today's menu. But there's one more thing left to do. Please join me in raising a toast.
[Prime Minister Modi spoke in English as follows.]
A toast to our wonderful host, President Biden and Dr. Jill Biden. A toast to good health, prosperity, and the pursuit of happiness. To liberty, equality, and fraternity. And to the everlasting bonds of friendship between India and the United States.
Cheers.
President Biden. Cheers.
[Prime Minister Modi offered a toast.]
Prime Minister Modi. Thank you.
President Biden. Enjoy your meal.

2023-06-22 00:00:00,Remarks at a Welcoming Ceremony for Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India,"
President Biden. Welcome, Mr. Prime Minister. Welcome back to the White House.
Audience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!
President Biden. I've long believed that the relationship between the United States and India is one of thewill be one of the defining relationships of the 21st century. Two proud nationstwo proud nationswhose love of freedom secured our independence, bound by the same words in our Constitution, the first three words: ""We the People."" The enduring ties and shared values between our people and the shared responsibility as global leaders to tackle the great issues of our time together.
I'm honored to be the first to have you here in 15 years. The United States is honoring and hosting an official visit for the Republic of India. Prime Minister Modi, welcome back to the White House.
Audience members. Modi! Modi! Modi!
President Biden. We've spent a lot of timewe've spent a lot of time together, going back to when I was Vice President and you had just become Prime Minister.
And since I've become President, we've continued a relationship built on mutual trust, candor, and respect. The challenges and opportunities facing the world in this century require that India and the United States work and lead together. And we are.
With your partnership, we've invigorated and elevated the Quad between the United States, India, Australia, and Japan to advance our vision of a free, open, secure, and prosperous Indo-Pacific. Decades from nowdecades from nowpeople will look back and say the Quad bent the arc of history toward ""global good,"" as the Prime Minister describes it.
Together, India and the United States are working closely on everything from ending poverty and expanding access to health care, to addressing climate change, to tackling food and energy insecurity stoked by Russia's unprovoked war in Ukraine.
We've made critical and emerging technologies the pillar of our next-generation partnership to ensure that these technologies promote and protect our values, remain open, accessible, and trusted and secure. All this matters for America, for India, and for the world.
We face an inflection point, one of those moments that only come around every several generations, when so much is changing technologically, politically, socially, and environmentally that the decisions we make today are going to determine our future for decades to come.
And as democracies, we can better tap into the full talent of all of our people and attract investments as true and trusted partners, as leading nations, with our greatest export being the power of our example.
Equity under the law, freedom of expression, religious pluralism, and diversity of our peoplethese core principles have endured and evolved, even as they have faced challenges throughout each of our nations' histories, and will fuel our strength, depth, and future.
And they form a special bond among our nations, forged by the special bond among our people, based on values that are universal: a duty to family and elders; treating all people with respect and dignity; a premium on education and creativity; self-discipline, hard work, entrepreneurship; faith and service to community; courage and resilience; and tolerance and opportunity for all.
I've seen this dynamism in my visits to India. I see it in Indian American diaspora that reflects every part of American life and remains a bridge between our nations and only grows stronger with each generation.
We see it with record numbers of Indian Americans serving in the United States Congress. We see it here at the White House, where proud Americans with Indian heritage serve our country every day, including our Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris.
The granddaughterthe proud granddaughter of an Indian civil servant, daughter of an Indian student turned American scientist who came to the United States when she was only 19 years old to pursue her dream of curing cancer. A family like so many of ours in our Nation that speaks to the thousand stories of determination, courage, and hope.
Stories that define the relationship and the limitless possibilities between the United States and India: two great nations, two great friends, two great powers that can define the course of the 21st century.
Mr. Prime Minister, thank you for your partnership. And I'll turn it over to you.
Audience members. Modi! Modi! Modi!
[At this point, Prime Minister spoke in Hindi, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
Prime Minister Modi. President Biden, First Lady Dr. Jill Biden, distinguished guests, friends from the Indian American community filled with energy and excitement: A very good morning to all of you.
First of all, I would like to express my gratitude to President Biden for his warm welcome and his farsighted speech.
[Prime Minister Modi spoke in English as follows.]
Thank you, President Biden, for your friendship.
[Prime Minister Modi spoke in Hindi, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
Friends, this grand welcome ceremony at the White House today is an honor and pride for 1.4 billion people of India. This is also an honor for more than 4 million people of Indian origin living in the U.S. For this honor, I express my heartfelt gratitude to President Biden and Dr. Jill Biden.
Friends, about three decades ago, I came on a visit to America as a common man. At that time, I had seen the White House from outside. After becoming the Prime Minister, I have come here many times. But today, for the first time, the doors of the White House have been opened for the Indian American community in such large numbers.
The people of the Indian community are enhancing India's glory in the U.S. through their talent, hard work, and dedication. You are the real strength of our relationship.
I thank President Biden and Dr. Jill Biden for the honor you've been given today. I think I can't thank him enough for this.
The societies and institutions of both India and the U.S. are based on democratic values. The constitutions of both countries begin with the following three words: ""We the People,"" as President Biden just mentioned. Both of our countries take pride in their diversity. Both of us believe in the fundamental principle of: ""in the interest of all, for the welfare of all.""
In the post-COVID era, the world order is taking a new shape. In this time period, the friendship between India and the U.S. will be instrumental in enhancing the strength of the whole world. The two countries are committed to work together for the global good and for global peace, stability, and prosperity. Our strong strategic partnership is a clear proof of the power of democracy.
Friends, in a short while from now, President Biden and I will discuss India-U.S. relations and various regional and global issues. I'm sure that, as always, our conversation today will be very positive and useful.
This afternoon I will also have an opportunity to address the U.S. Congress for a second time. I am deeply grateful for this honor.
I wish for, and the 1.4 billion people of India wish with me, for India's Tricolor and America's Stars and Stripes to always keep flying higher and higher.
President Biden, Dr. Jill Biden, once again, I thank you for your kind invitation, for your warm welcome and hospitality, also on behalf of 1.4 billion people of India.
Jai hind. God bless America. Thank you very much.

2023-06-22 00:00:00,Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India and an Exchange With Reporters,"
President Biden. Well, Mr. PresidentMr. PresidentMr. Prime Minister[inaudible]Modi. Mr. Prime Minister, thank you for being here, and welcome back to the White House.
Almost exactly 10 years ago, when I visited Mumbai as Vice President, I emphasized how important it was for India and the United States to continue building a partnership small stepssmall stepsat a time.
Over that past 10 years, those small steps have transformed into large progress. And today, the partnership between our countries is stronger than it has ever been.
We see it in our major defense partnership, now a pillar in the Indo-Pacific peace and security structure. We see it in our economic ties and efforts to promote inclusive economic growth for our people and, quite frankly, people all around the world.
And we see it in our growing cooperation on a whole range of issues: in space, emerging technologies, clean energy, global infrastructure.
And I want to thank you, Mr. Prime Minister, for your decision toand hosting the G-20 this year and focusing the world on the challenges that matter not just to you and I and our countries, but to all of us.
And I look forward to discussing how we can strengthen our partnership and build a future together worthy of both our peoples, one grounded on democracy, human rights, freedom, and the rule of law.
So welcome again, Mr. Prime Minister. We have a big agenda, I think, to continue to build our progress, again, step by step, but continue to build.
Thank you for being here.
[At this point, Prime Minister Modi spoke in Hindi, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
Prime Minister Modi. Your Excellency, President Biden, I once again express my heartfelt gratitude to you and to Dr. Jill Biden for the hospitality and the respect that you have shown to me and my delegation and, more importantly, because you opened the doors of the White House today for the Indian American people, and they were there in thousands to witness the future of our strategic partnership.
Your Excellency, you've always been India's friend and a well-wisher for a very long time. And whenever you have gotten an opportunity, you have always given force and strength to our bilateral relations.
Excellency, 8 years ago, while addressing the U.S.-India Business Council, you had said, ""Our goal is to become India's best friend."" And it is this personal commitment of yours towards India that is inspiring us to take many bold and ambitious initiatives.
Today, India and the U.S. are walking shoulder to shoulder in every field, from the depths of the oceans to the heights of the skies, from ancient culture to artificial intelligence.
Excellency, whenever there is talk of relations between any two countries from a diplomatic point of view, people often talk about some formal joint statements, working groups, MOUs. All of these definitely have their own importance, but the real engine of the India-U.S. relationship is our strong people-to-people ties. And we just heard a spirited roar of that engine out on the White House lawns.
Your Excellency, as you saidand I would like to reiterate thatin today's rapidly changing global situation, all eyes are on the two largest democracies of the world: India and America.
I believe that our strategic partnership is important for welfare of the humankind, global peace and stability, and for all countries believing in democratic values. And this is important than ever before. I'm confident that, working together, we will be successful in enhancing the strengths of the whole world.
We will talk about many such issues today, and we will add new dimensions to our strategic partnership. I once again express my heartfelt gratitude to you for your friendship.
Thank you, Mr. President.
[Prime Minister Modi spoke in English as follows.]
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you, press. [Laughter]
Q. Mr. President, was it a mistake to call Xi a ""dictator""?
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, can you speak to the treatment of Muslims in India right now?
Q. Do you regret calling Xi a ""dictator""?
R. Hunter Biden 
Q. Mr. President, how's Hunter feeling?
[President Biden gave a thumbs-up.]
Q. Still? Hunter's feeling good?

2023-06-22 00:00:00,The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India,"
President Biden. Please, be seated. Thank you.
Well, good afternoon. The Prime Minister and I have just finished a very productive meeting.
And the Prime MinisterI know you've got to get up to Capitol Hill very soon and to address the Joint Session of Congress. It's a testament to the strong and enduring and thoroughly bipartisan support that exists all across the United States for the friendship and partnership between India and the United States that thethey're anxiously waiting to hear you up on Capitol Hill.
A partnership that is among the most consequential in the world, that is stronger, closer, and more dynamic than any time in history. Mr. Prime Minister, we've met many times over the past few years, most recently in Hiroshima at the G-7 summit. And each time, I was struck by our ability to find new areas of cooperation. Together, we're unlocking a shared future of what I believe to be unlimited potential.
And with this visit, we're demonstrating once more how India and the United States are collaborating on nearly every human endeavor and delivering progress across the board, forfrom designing new ways to diagnose and treat illnesses like cancer and diabetes; to collaborating on human spaceflight including sending an Indian astronaut to the International Space Station in 2024; to accelerating a global clean energy transition and tackling climatethe climate crisis we face; to harnessing our shared expertise on critical and emerging technologies like quantum computing and artificial intelligence to ensuring they are not used as tools of misinformation and oppression.
We are doubling down on our cooperation to secure our semiconductor supply chains, advancing Open RAN telecommunications networks, and growing our major defense partnership with the more joint exercises, more cooperation between our defense industries, and more consultation and coordination across all domains.
Our economic relationship is booming. Trade between our countries has almost doubled over the past decade to more than $191 billion, supporting tens of thousands of good jobs in both India and the United States.
Add to that: One million American jobs across 44 States will by supported by the purchase of more than 200more than 200American-made Boeing aircraft bythat Air India is announcing earlier this year.
And with this visit, Indian firms are announcing more than $2 billionmore than $2 billionin new investments in manufacturingin solar in Colorado, steel in Ohio, and optic fiber in South Carolina, and much more. Further proof that America's manufacturing is back.
We're expanding educational exchanges for our students, building on the record 125,000 student visas for Indians to study in the United States we issued last year and opening new consulates that's going to make it easier for our people to travel, work, and collaborate together.
On the issues that matter most and that will define the future, our nations look to one another, including on critical regional and global issues.
And today we also talked about our shared efforts to mitigate the humanitarian tragedies unleashed by Russia's brutal war in Ukraine and to defend the core principles of the U.N. Charter: sovereignty and territorial integrity.
We discussed our work through the Quad and how India and the United States, together with Australia and Japan, can ensure the vital Indo-Pacific region remains free, open, prosperous, and secure.
Through our new I2U2 grouping with Israel and the U.A.E., we're building regional connections to the Middle East and spurring science-based solutions andto the global challenges, like food security and clean energy.
And this year, under India's leadership of the G-20, we're putting sustainable development at the center of the agenda. We're delivering meaningful action on low- and middle-income nations, including multilateral development bank reform, debt relief, and building resilient and equitable health systems. The bottom line is simple: We want people everywhere to have the opportunity to live in dignity.
And let me beclose with this: Indians and Americans are both peoples who innovate and create, turn obstacles into opportunities, who find strength in community and family, and who cherish freedom and celebrate the democratic values of universal human rights, which face challenges around the world and eachand in each of our countries, but which remain so vital to the success of each of our nations: press freedom, religious freedom, tolerance, diversity.
India now has the most populous countryis now the most populous country in the world. It's a democracy. And we understand that it ishasit is the brilliance and the backbone of our people as diverse in talents and traditions that make us strong as a nation. It's democracies that do that.
We see that so clearly here in the United States where a vibrant Indian American community of more than 4 million strong contributes every single day to the writing of the future of our nation.
Indian Americans of every background and faith, representing the full diversity of India, are pursuing their American dream while maintaining deep connections for their Indian heritage and families.
That makes us all stronger. That is a cornerstone of this essential partnership between India and the United States. And that is why I know the friendship between our nations is only going to grow as we face the future together.
Mr. Prime Minister, the floor is yours.
Prime Minister Modi. Your Excellency, President Biden; delegates of both countries; friends from the media: Namaskar.
First of all, I thank President Biden for his warm words and for his positive views on India-America relations. Friends, today is a day that has special importance in the history of India-America relations. Our discussions today and the important decisions we have taken have added a new chapter to our comprehensive and global strategic partnership. They have given it a new direction and a new energy.
Friends, a trade and investment partnership between India and America is important not only for our two countries, but for the global economy as well. Today, America is India's biggest trade partner. We have decided to resolve long-pending trade-related issues and make a new beginning.
The Initiative for Critical and Emerging Technologies, iCET, has emerged as an important framework for our technical cooperation. By increasing our cooperation in fields such as artificial intelligence, semiconductors, space, quantum, and telecom, we are creating a strong and futuristic partnership. The decision taken by American companies such as Micron, Google, and Applied Materials to invest in India symbolizes this futuristic partnership.
During this journey, I also had the opportunity to meet some other American CEOs. And in my discussions with them, I could feel their enthusiasm and their positive views about India. We both agree that to make a strategic technology partnership meaningful, it is very important that governments, businesses, and academic institutions come together.
In order to implement India and America's shared vision on clean energy transition, we have taken several important initiatives. These cover areas such as green hydrogen, wind energy, battery storage, and carbon capture.
We have also decided that in the midst of global uncertainties, India and America will, as trusted partners, create reliable, secure, and resilient global supply chains and value chains, as well.
The close defense cooperation between India and America symbolizes mutual trust and shared strategic priorities. Moving away from the old buyer-seller relationship we had earlier, we have transitioned today to a relationship involving transfer of technology, codevelopment, and coproduction.
The decision taken by General Electric to manufacture engines in India through transfer of technology is a landmark agreement. This also opens up new job opportunities in both countries. This will give our defense cooperation a new character in the times to come. The defense industries and startups of both countries are important partners in this cooperation. Bringing them together is the key objective of our defense industrial roadmap.
In the area of space, science, and technologies, we have had longstanding cooperation. By taking the decision to join the Artemis Accords, we have taken a big leap forward in our space cooperation. In fact, in short, for India and America partnership, even the sky is not the limit.
Friends, the most important pillar of our relations is our people-to-people ties. More than 4 million people of Indian origin today make significant contribution to the progress of America.
In fact, just this morning, the large number of Indians that gathered at the White House demonstrates that the Indian Americans, in fact, are the real strength behind our relations. In order to further deepen these relations, we welcome America's decision to open consulates in Bengaluru and Ahmedabad. Similarly, we will also open a new Indian consulate in Seattle.
Friends, in our meeting today, we discussed several regional and global issues. Peace and security in the Indo-Pacific is our common priority. We agree that the development and success of this region is important for the entire world.
We shared our views to enhance coordination with all countries in this region, along with our Quad partners. India and America stand shoulder to shoulder in the fight against terrorism and fundamentalism. We were in agreement that concrete actions are needed in order to end cross-border terrorism.
The COVID pandemic and the Ukraine conflict have afflicted the countries of the Global South in particular. We believe that in order to resolve these problems, it is absolutely imperative for all countries to unite.
From the very beginning of the events in Ukraine, India has laid emphasis on resolution of dispute through dialogue and diplomacy. We are completely ready to contribute in any way we can to restore peace.
Under India's G-20 Presidency, we are laying emphasis on the spirit of ""One Earth, One Family, One Future."" We are lending a voice to the priorities of the Global South. I thank President Biden that he has expressed support to my proposal of giving the African Union full membership of the G-20.
Friends, the core philosophy of all of our collective efforts is to strengthen democracy and democratic values and democratic order.
Two of the world's largest democracies, India and America, can together make an important contribution to global peace, stability, and prosperity. I'm confident that based on these values, we will be able to fulfill the expectations and aspirations of not only the people of our two countries, but of the entire world.
President Biden, thank you for the meaningful discussion today.
This year, during the G-20 summit, we are looking forward to welcoming youthis is myselfand all of India is looking forward to welcoming you to India.
And as the President has said, I do have another engagement after this. I need to address the Congress. So I do not want to take any more time. And I am going to stop here. Once again, President Biden, thank you very much.
President Biden. Well, the Congress is actually waiting toand anxiously waiting to hear you.
I'm told there are two questioners: Sabrina [Sabrina Siddiqui] from the Wall Street Journal and Kumar [Kumar Rakesh; Press Trust of India] from the Trust of India.
And, Sabrina, you first.
China-U.S. Relations/India/Democratic Values 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I have a question for the Prime Minister. But first, a two-part question for you: Your comments at a fundraiser this week appear to be the first time in recent memory that a sitting U.S. President has called a Chinese leader a dictator. Did those comments about President Xi undermine or complicate the progress your administration has made in maintaining a relationship with China?
And secondly, on India: As you raise these broader issues of human rights and democracy, what is your message to those, including some members of your own party, who say that your administration is overlooking the targeting of religious minorities and crackdown on dissent in Prime Minister Modi's country?
President Biden. The answer to your first question is: No. You know, whatwhen we're talking to our allies and partners around the world, including India, we let the idea of my choosing and avoiding saying what I think is the facts with regard to the relationship with Indiawith China isjust not something I'm going to change very much.
I think weI believe thatand I've said this for some timethat the hysteria about the relationship with China is collapsing and moving, et cetera, et ceterawe had an incident that caused some confusion, you might say. But Presidentbut Secretary Blinken had a great trip to China. I expect to be meeting with President Xi sometime in the future, in the near term. And I don't think it's had any real consequence.
And what was your second question?
Q. So, as you raise these broader issues onof human rights and democracy, what is your message to thoseincluding some members of your own partywho believe that your administration is overlooking the targeting of religious minorities and a crackdown on dissent in India?
President Biden. Well, look, the Prime Minister and I had a good discussion about democratic values. And there is athere is thethat's the nature of our relationship: We're straightforward with each other, and we respect each other.
One of the fundamental reasons that I believe the U.S.-China relationship is not in the space it is with the U.S.- Indian relationship is that there's an overwhelming respect for each other because we're both democracies. And it's a common democratic character of both our countries thatand our peopleour diversity; our culture; our open, tolerant, robust debate.
And I believe that we believe in the dignity of every citizen. And it is in America's DNA and, I believe, in India's DNA that the whole worldthe whole worldhas a stake in our success, both of us, in maintaining our democracies. It makes us appealing partners and enables us to expand democratic institutions acrossaround the world. And I believe this, and I still believe this.
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, India has long prided itself as the world's largest democracy, but there are many human rights groups who say that your government has discriminated against religious minorities and sought to silence its critics. As you stand here in the East Room of the White House, where so many world leaders have made commitments to protecting democracy, what steps are you and your government willing to take to improve the rights of Muslims and other minorities in your country and to uphold free speech?
Prime Minister Modi. I'm actually really surprised that people say so. And so people don't say it. Indeed, India is a democracy.
And, as President Biden also mentioned, India and Americaboth countries, democracy is in our DNA. Democracy is our spirit. Democracy runs in our veins. We live democracy. And our ancestors have actually put words to this concept, and that is in the form of our constitution.
Our government has taken the basic principles of democracy. And on that basis, our constitution is made, and the entire country runs on that: our constitution and government. We have always proved that democracy can deliver. And when I say deliver, this is regardless of caste, creed, religion, gender. There's absolutely no space for discrimination.
And when you talk of democracy, if there are no human values and there is no humanity, there are no human rights, then it's not a democracy.
And that is why, when you say ""democracy"" and you accept democracy and when we live democracy, then there is absolutely no space for discrimination. And that is why India believes in moving ahead with everybody with trust and with everybody's efforts.
These are our foundation principles, which are the basis of how we operate, how we live our lives. In India, the benefits that are provided by the Government is accessible to all. Whoever deserves those benefits is available to everybody. And that is why, in India's democratic values, there's absolutely no discrimination neither on basis of caste, creed, or age, or any kind of geographic location.
President Biden. Kumar.
Climate Change/Conservation Efforts/Carbon Emission Reductions 
Q. Yes, thanks a lot, sir. Sir, my question is on the issue of climate change. Both countries have spoken strongly about the need to tackle the climate change. But there's a view
President Biden. Tackle what?
Audience member. Climate change.
Q. Both
President Biden. Climate change. I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
Q. Yes. Both countries have spoken about the challenge of climate change. But there is a view that ambitious targets are set, but implementation is found often lacking. And there is also a criticism of lack of technological transfer, financial transfer from the developed countries to the developing nations.
How do you both leaders see the way ahead on this pressing issue?
President Biden. Well, first of all, I think it is the existential threat to humanity: climate change. It's the most serious problem we face as human beings. We have to keep it below 1.5 degrees Celsius. We've made enormous progress here in the United States on dealing with this issue by doing three things.
Number one, by insisting that we move ourevery one of our industries into a position where they can take advantage of cheaper and more extensive and more available renewable energy, whether it's solar or wind or hydrogen and green hydrogen. There's a whole range of things we've been working on.
In addition to that, we find ourselves in a position thatwhat we've done is that we have significantly reduced thefor example, I made a commitment that we are going to make sure that by 2030, 30 percent of all our land and sea and oceans werearewere in conservation, could not be developed. We're well on our way to doing that. And that's also absorbing carbon from the air as a consequence of that, because of the conservation.
We are in a position, as well, bywe have provided for significant increase in funding for a whole range of issues, but not just for the United States, but for the rest of the world.
For example, we're working with the G-7 to provide for infrastructure work for dealing with global warming on the continent of Africa: in Angola, building the largest solar project; moving ourselveshaving railway to go all the way across the southern two-thirdsthefrom the Atlantic Ocean to the Indian Ocean, in Africa, to be able to transport and do it cheaper and do it with lesshow can I say it?less carbon emissions.
We're trying to work with other countries to maintain their carbon sinks so they don't have to develop them like we did and causing pollution. And we're trying to figure out how to work out to pay them not to develop certain areas, like the Amazon in Brazil.
But there's a lot of technology that's available that we're sharing, and we share with one another. We've learned how to do solar energy, which is considerably cheaper than it is tofor fuelfor fossil fuels. The same way dealing with not just solar, but dealing with wind.
And so there's a lot of the technology that we've developed. And we're well on our way, I think, to meeting the commitment we made tothat we made in Paris. And Iand we're prepared to share all of that with India, that has a desire to do the same.
Prime Minister Modi. Excellency, you said very rightly that, as far as India is concerned, the environment, climate, these are extremely important in our cultural traditions. For us, the environment is an article of faith. This is not just something that we need to do for convenience; we believe this.
We do not believe in the exploitation of nature. In order for all of creation to work, we can make naturebut we cannot have exploitation of nature, and we have always believed this.
And on the basis of these values, we are not only doing things for ourselves, but are taking some global initiatives, as well. You perhaps know that the G-20 countries, the promises they made in Paris, of all the G-20 countries, India is the only country that has fulfilled all the promises it made at the G-20.
Not just that, in the area of solar energy, in Glasgow, we had set ourselves a target to achieve 500 gigawatts of renewable energy. By 2030, we have set ourselves a target to make Indian railways net zero.
And you must understand the scale of Indian railways. When we talk about Indian railways, it means that every day the entire population of Australia travels in our wagonsin our railway wagons, on our trains. And we have set ourselves a target to achieve net zero for our railways.
We have also set ourselves targets for solar energy, for ethanol10 percent mix of ethanol. We have completed this target before the set date.
We are also working in the area of green hydrogen. We want India to be a green hydrogen hub, and we are working towards this.
Inand the International Solar Alliance has been launched by India, and many countries have joined it and are working with India. The island countries, we have helped them in the area of solar energy so that they have now got a new confidence that we are with them in their efforts to fight climate change. And we will not only fulfill our responsibilities, but we will also help you in the area of climate change.
We have seen that due to natural calamitiespeople talk about the death of people, no doubt, when there are natural disasters, but there is a lot of destruction of infrastructure as well.
And therefore, because of climate change, the kind of crisis we are feeling, we need to develop infrastructure that is resilient. And therefore, we have created a global organization called CDRI. And you perhaps know that in Glasgow I presented a subject to the world. And recently, it was launched by the U.N. Secretary General and myself. That is Mission LiFE. And when I say ""LiFE,"" I mean ""Lifestyle for the Environment."" Therefore, every individual must live his life in a pro-environment, pro-development way. And we are working towards this.
And I am sure that whatever work India has started in all these areasnot because India has adversely affected the environment of the world; we are doing this because we have a concern for future generations. We do not want to give our future generations a world that make life difficult for them.
And therefore, as a global responsibility, India has not caused any problems to the environment. However, we are playing a leading role in contributing in a positive manner.
As far as prosperous countries are concerned, there's always been talk about technology transfer, financial support, and there are some countries that need to have technology transfer, financial support. And we hope that as soon as we can move forward in this area, we will be able to solve this challenge of climate change. Thank you very much.
President Biden. Let me add one thing. We have caused damage in the United States the way we developed over the last 300 years. And that's why I was able to convince my colleagues in the Congress to pass legislationthe largest climate fund ever in Americanin the world history: $369 billion$369 billionto deal with the climate crisis.
And we are doing it extensively now, and I think you're going to see significant progress.
Thank you all very, very much.

The President. Everybody in? Well, thanks for joining me today, everyone. I appreciate it very much.
And especially thanks to my buddy Governor Newsom, who is one of the best Governors I've ever worked with, and Arati, themy Director of my Office of Science and Technology and Policy.
And earlier this year, we met with my Council on Science and Technology Advisers and some of America's top minds to discuss the possibilities and the risks associated with artificial intelligence. In May, Kamala and I convened the CEOs of American companies foremost involved in AI development to underscore their responsibility in making sure their products are used safely before making them public.
The same here today: I want to hear directly from the experts. And these are the worldsome of the world's leading experts on this issue and the intersection of technology and society, who we can provide a rangewho can provide a range of perspectives for us andon AI's enormous promise and its risks.
As I've said before, we'rewe'll see more technological change in the next 10 years than we've seen in the last 50 years and maybe even beyond that. And AI is already driving that change in every part of the American life, often in ways we don't notice.
AI is already making it easier to search the internet, helping us drive to our destinations while avoiding traffic in real time. AI is going to change the way we teach, learn, and help solve challenges like disease and climate change and giving the time to focus on the things that matter most to you personally.
Andbut in seizing this moment, we need to manage the risks to our society, to our economy, and our national security. My administration is committedis committedto safeguarding America's rights and safety, from protecting privacy, to addressing bias and disinformation, to making sure AI systems are safe before they are released.
Last October, we proposed an AI bill of rights to ensure that important protections were built into the AI systems from the very start. Earlier this year, I signed an Executive order to direct my Cabinet to root out bias in the design and use of AI. And in May, we announced a new strategy for funding the responsiblefor responsible AI development so Americans can lead the way and drive breakthroughs in this critical area, from cybersecurity to public health to agriculture to education and, quite frankly, so much more.
Social media has already shown us the harm of powerfulthat powerful technology can do without the right safeguards in place. That's why I said at the State of the Union that Congress needs to pass bipartisan privacy legislation to impose strict limits on personal data collection, ban targeting advertising to our children, and require companies to put health and safety first.
Next month, the Vice President will bewill convene the civil rights leaders of America, consumer protection groups, and civil society to continue theour administration's ongoing engagement on AI.
But today I'd like to hear more from this group, because I have a lot to learn, and we also have a lot to discuss. So I'd like to ask the press to leave the room. Thank you for coming in.
R. Hunter Biden 
Q. Mr. President, have you spoken to your son today? Have you spoken to Hunter today?

2023-06-20 00:00:00,"Remarks at a Campaign Reception in Kentfield, California","
The President. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I'm going home now. [Laughter]
Stephanie and Mark, thanks for welcoming me into your home. And, Gov, I tell you what, weI tell you what: Iit's amazing the job you do. I really mean it. And I can't thank you for your friendshipI can't thank you enough.
And as I've told you many times, I don't know how the hell you got her, but you're a good man. [Laughter] We bothwe both married way above our station. [Laughter]
And look, you know, all of you being here, I don't know why you'd ever leave here. [Laughter] It's magnificent. And I want to thank you.
You know, I've met a lot of world leaders. And I come at this reelection thinking about what I was asked by Xi JinpingI've spent a lot of hours with him over the last 12 years. I mean, in overthey keep meticulous records82 hours' worth just he and I, 60-some of it in person.
And we were in the Tibetan Plateau, and he said, ""Can you define America for me?"" And I said: ""Yes, I can. In one word""the Gov has heard me say this before""In one word: possibilities. Possibilities.""
One of the reasons why we're always referred to, Mr. President, by others as ""the ugly Americans"": We think we can do anything. And we can do anything we set our mind to. But we just haven't focused muchvery much in the last 4 or 5 years in terms of focusing on what we need to do.
I'm convinced if we work together, there's not a damn thing we can't get done. Now, Iand I mean that. I mean that sincerely.
You know, we'vewhen I announced the first time, I said I was running for
[At this point, the President tapped the microphone.]
Is this working?
Audience member. Yeah!
The President. I indicated I was running for three reasons. Because remember when thedown in Charlottesville, Virginia, and there wastoward the end of thethe beginning of the last President's campaign, and they askedtheseall of a sudden, coming out of the woods in the fields, literally carrying torcheslighted torches, were hundreds of people who were singing and chanting the same anti-Semitic bile that was chanted in Germany in the early thirties, and accompanied by the Ku Klux Klan.
And a young woman was killed. And in the process, I've talked to her mom. And the President was asked, ""Well, what do you think happened down there?"" And he said, ""Well, there were very good people on both sides.""
And that's when I decided I had to get engaged, had to get back out, because Imy son had just passed. I didn't want to run again, didn't want to be engaged. But I came back to make the case.
And I ran on three principles that even my good friends and my staff werethought maybe weren't able to be conveyed very well. I said, ""The first reason I'm running is to restore the soul of this country.""
And Jon Meacham wrote a book about the soul of America, about restoring the soul, a sense of decency, who we are, what we stand for. We're good people. We have always been a good people. And we stood for things that were of conscious concern for others.
The second reason I said I was running was to rebuild the economy from the middle out and the bottom up, because when that happens, everybody does well. Everybody does well.
And I said the third reason I was runningand the press, justifiablyand I'm not criticizing themsaid: ""That was the old days, Mr. Vice President."" And that wasI said I was going to unite America.
How can a democracy function without being able to reach a consensus? How can it last very long?
And so I set out to do those three things. And one of the things that happened was that, you know, I found that thingspeople thought that things were in tough shape. I made a speech right after Iwell, it was just before I was elected last timeat Independence Hall, talking about democracy, that democracy was at stake. Literally at stake.
And it turned out the press understandably thought that waswhat the hell was I talking about? But over 63 percent of the American people agree that there's something wrong because of what's happening. Our freedoms are being stripped away.
And you know, but since then, we've made a lot of progress. You know, you can see most clearly that we got an incredible amount of bipartisan legislation passed. So much for not being able to bring people together.
And we also brought back NATO together in a way thatbecause we had Russia, which I indicated that it was going to invade, and they did, with 185,000 forces in Europein another country.
And Putin was convinced that he would be able to split NATO because we'd never stick together, we'd never do it. And we've been able to hold NATO together. Altogether, NATO is stronger today than it's ever been.
And then we began to invest in America again. Because, you know, when I talked about rebuilding from the middle out, we got to a position where we spent a lot of time concluding, Democrats and Republicans, that the best way to grow the economy was to go where the cheapest labor was in the world and ship our jobs overseas and, in the meantime, bring back products made abroad.
Well, you know, there'sthose of you who are from other parts of the country before you got here, you saw that if you lived in the Midwest or in theeven in near Midwest, in Pennsylvania and other places, all of a sudden, that factory that's been there for 35 years that supported your grandfather and grandmother and, you know, had six, eight hundred people in itwhen that factory shuts down, the whole city shuts down, the town shuts down. People lose their sense of dignity. They lose their sense of who they are. They begin to wonder.
And so we decided todecided we were going to no longer findnot have access to the source of what we needed to build our economy. And so we went out, and I decided we're going to try to bring backwe used towe invented the computer chip. We're the guys that came about and did that. And the little chip is smaller than the tip of your finger. Whether you need 300 of them for an automobile, all of a suddenyou need it for everything we have.
We used towe used to40 years ago, 40 percent of the chips were made in America. Now down to 10 percent.
So I started around the country, and we convinced $300 billion worth of investment$300 billion worth of investment, building these newthey call ""fabs,"" creating jobs that are of consequence for people.
And, for example, out in just outside of Columbus, Ohio, Intel went out there, and I call it the ""field of dreams."" They were the first one to commit. They're going to buildthey're going to spend a whole lot of money: $100 billion building two new fabs out there. And 5,000 full-time employees, 7,000 people building the facility at the prevailing wage.
And guess what? The average salary in those fabs is going to be up close to $130,000. And you don't need a college degree. You don't need a college degree to do it.
And now we have over $300 billion committed to build these facilities across the country. $450 billion in foreign investment and private investment to begin to rebuild America in a way we didn'twe haven't looked at it that way in a long time.
We've, in the meantime, as you heard the Governor say, all the jobs we created and all the manufacturing jobs. But beyond that, we did something else. We unleashed, I think, a sense ofonce again, a sense of expectation in America that we can do anything.
We used toyou know, when we recall theyou know, the possibilities, you know? Well, guess what? We used to believe that we couldthere wasn't a single thing, if America set its mind to it, couldn't get done. I'm notthat sounds like hyperbole, but I mean it.
But so what's happened? We started to figure out we can do it again. For example, the largest computer chipmaker in South Korea invested in the United States billions of dollars. And I visited with him in South Korea. I said, ""Why?"" He said: ""Because it's the safest investment I can make anywhere in the world in the United States of America. That's why I'm doing it. And you have the best workers in the world.""
And so we're beginning to restore not just opportunity for jobs, but pride and dignity in work.
My dad used to have an expression. He said: ""Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about your sense of yourself. It's about being able to look your family in the eye and say: ""Honey, it's going to be okay. It's going to be okay.'""
Well, that's starting to happen again. That's starting to happen again. We're restoring a sense of dignity to a whole lot of people who were left behind. And they're coming back.
And we're in a situation where we decided whenyou know, I know there's a lot support from this crowd, but the fact is that how many times overthis is just 6 years agohow many of your friends who were doing well didn't think there was much to global warming?
Well, all of a sudden, I flew over more territory with the Governor in a helicopter, and other Governors throughout the country, from Arizona and New Mexico, all the way up to the State of Washington State and Idaho and the rest. More timber has burned to the ground than comprises the entire landmass of the State of Maryland.
And people are no longer wondering whether or not we have a problem with the environment. People are stepping up. And we were able to pass legislation for $368 billion for environmental investment. Did both to do a whole range of things that are going to fundamentally change the way we work. We're now in a situation where, just since I've become President, we have made sure that we have thousands and thousands of acres put in conservation. More land in conservation than any time since John Kennedy was President.
And I made a commitment that 30 percent of all our lands and all our waters are going to be in conservation by the year 2030. We're well on our way to doing that. And that's going to make a profound impact on what we have and what we deal with in terms of the environment.
And as I said, with regard to Europe, when I told people that we were going to bringI thought we could bring Japan along. You know, Japan hasn't increased its military budget for a long, long time. But guess what? I met with the chairmanthe Presidentthe Viceexcuse me, the leader of Japan for, I guess, on three different occasions, including in Hiroshima. And he convincedI convinced him and he convinced himself that he had to do something different.
Japan has increased its military budget exponentially. And guess what? When is the last time you heard Japan being interested in what's happening in the middle of Europe in a war and contributing to the help and support of the state of Ukraine?
And so things are changing. We put together in Southeast Asiaand by the way, I promise you we're going todon't worry about China. I mean, worry about China, but don't worry about China. [Laughter]
No, but I really mean it. China is realhas real economic difficulties. And the reason why Xi Jinping got very upset in terms of when I shot that balloon down with two boxcars full of spy equipment in it is, he didn't know it was there. No, I'm serious. That's what's a great embarrassment for dictators, when they didn't know what happened. That wasn't supposed to be going where it was. It was blown off course up through Alaska and then down through the United States. And he didn't know about it. When it got shot down, he was very embarrassed. He denied it was even there.
But thedidthe very important point is he's in a situation now where he wants to have a relationship again. Tony Blinken just went over thereour Secretary of State; did a good job. And it's going to take time.
But what he was really upset about was that I insisted that we reunite the Quadso-called Quad. He called me and told me not to do that because it was putting him in a bind. I said: ""All we're doingwe're not trying to surround you, we're just trying to make sure the international rules with air and sea lanes remain open. And we're not going to yield to thaton that.""
So now we have India, Australia, Japan, and the United States working hand in glove in the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean.
We have a situation where I've met with all 50 of the major maritime states in East Asia. And they'reI mean, I never thought, as a kid coming out of the Vietnam war era, that we would have Cambodia, Vietnam, and Laos wanting closer relationships with the United States of America.
So my point is, the world is changing, and we have an opportunity to not take advantage of it at everyone else's expense, but to change the dynamic in the world. We're in a position now where Russia iswell, let me put this way: If I told any of youor matter of fact, if you told me that Russia was going to send 185,000 troops into the country of Ukraine without it being armed, and that the Russians at this point were still going to have lost well over 100,000 personnel and be in the shape they're in, I think you would have looked at me like I was crazy.
Well, the Ukrainian people are tough as hell, and we can't let it happen, because if we let it happen, then next is, you have the rest of eastern NATO nations are in trouble.
My generic point is, there's enormous opportunity. Enormous opportunity. And the world is looking to the United States. I mean, they really are. They're looking to the United States. Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was right when she said America is the essential nation. Because who else will organize it? Who else can lead it, any other nation in the world be able to do it by themselves?
And so we put thewe pulled our allies together. Things are changing around the world. And there's great danger too. There's great danger. I'm not suggesting there's not danger, but unless we are prepared, unless we know what we're about, unless we're engaged. And that's why the first thing I did basically was say we're ending the policy of ""America first."" It's not America first. It's America with our allies, because that's what we need around the world. We need those efforts.
We're also working like helland I'm not going to go into a whole foreign policy thing. I apologize. But you know, just to put one thing in perspective, Africa is going to have 1 billion people by the end of this decade. A billion people. A billion. And guess what? They don't have the capacity to deal with a lot of their needs. And it's overwhelmingly in our interest.
So we're in the process of making sure that we help build the first railroad across the continent; that we have Angola have the firstthe largest solar facility in the world; that building up the infrastructure for those countries, because it's in our interest that they do well financially and not disrupt.
And so I guess the whole point of this is that we're also working on making sure that we deal with some of the other problems, which I'll just tick off.
One is the whole idea of dealing with gun violence. The idea that more children die as a consequence of a gunshot wound of a bullet than any other reason in America is sick. It's really sick.
And the fact that the NRA has such overwhelming poweryou know, the NRA is the only outfit in the Nation that we cannot sue as an institution. They gottheybefore thisI became President, they passed legislation saying you can't sue them. Imagine had that been the case with tobacco companies. How many more people would be dead today if we weren't able to rein in tobacco companies and the use of tobacco? Well, it's that way now. We can't.
And by the way, you know one of the reasons why the AR-15 is so strongly supported by so many folks in that industry? Number one, it's the cheapest weapon to make, and it's the highest profit motive they have for any weapon that is made. It makes more money to sell an AR-15 than any other weapon you can buy.
And so we have to changethere's a lot of things we can change, because the American people by and large agree you don't need a weapon of war. I'm a Second Amendment guy. I taught it for 4 years, 6 years in law school. And guess what? It doesn't say that you can own any weapon you want. It says there are certain weapons that you just can't own. Even during when it was passed, you couldn't own a cannon. You can't own a machinegun. [Laughter] No, I'm serious.
So what's the deal with the idea that it's an absoluteyou know, I love these guys who say the Second Amendment isyou know, the tree of liberty is water with the blood of patriots. Well, if want to do that, you want to work against the Government, you need an F-16. You need something else than just an AR-15. Anyway.
The generic point[laughter]the generic point I want to make isand I'm going to end this because I'm bored myself now. [Laughter]
But you know, we have to make sure that we have some economic freedom, the ability to get a good job. And freedom is really under siege, particularly freedom of choice: the right of a woman to choose, the right of a woman to determine whatbetween she and her doctor what she needs in her body. And now they're going after contraception.
And mark my wordsand I said that when the decision came down, the Dobbs decision. Because two of the Justices said: Let's make it clear, not only there's no constitutional protection for the right to choose, there's no constitutional protection for contraception, there's no constitutional right in the law for HBexcuse mefor gay, lesbianyou know, the wholethe whole group. There's no constitutional protection. And they're coming after it.
You see what all the States have done, the number of States that have passed legislation, imposing on all those rights.
And so, folks, we're in a situation where I think things are beginning to change. But I think the American people need to have the confidence that we're going to do what we say we're going to do. And I think that the combination of keeping the economy growing and keeping the economy growing in a way that everyone has a shot at benefiting from it, everyone is engaged, keeping thedealing with the freedoms that we have taken away.
We've gotI insist that we're going to pass legislation in a majority of the States reinstating Roe v. Wade. That's the only way we can get back these rights. And it's going to happen.
So, folks, you know, there's an awful lot that is being done relative to the environment. There's an awful lot being done in terms of our ability to grow the economy. There's an awful lot that needs to be done on education. I need not tell you, Mr. President.
You know, we learnedand I'll end with this: You know, the whole idea ofHead Start is a good idea. But what's even more important isputs people in school. All the research doneand I'm going to mention the school; it's against my interest to do it. Stanford. I'm joking. [Laughter]
Stanford and Harvard did studies about what is, over the last 10 years, what is that will help peoplekeep people going in terms of education. If you sendwe learned all those statisticsI remember all you involved in this stuff knowthat when you come from a broken home, where there's no books and mom or dad is an addict, and they can't get thingsyou know, you have no guidanceby the time you get to preschoolto school, I should saykindergartenyou will have heard a million few wordsfewer spoken, total. Total. The same words, but a million words fewer. And you also are going to be in a situation where you have had significantly less exposure to learning, period.
Now, if you put kids in schoolschoolreading, writing, arithmeticbeginning at age 3, you increase by 56 percent the chance of them going all the way through all 12 years and having the chance to go to community college.
Why is it that it's not overwhelmingly in our interest? My wife is an educator at a community college; says any country that outeducates us is going to outcompete usis going to outcompete us. It's true.
So one of the things I'm going to continue to work on is early education, as well as free community college for people who, in fact, don't have the income to get there.
And so, folks, with your help, we've gotten a lot done. And guess what? All the things we've done so farand I was able in the first 2 years to cut the Federal debt by 1 trillion 700 billion dollars. More than any President has in American history. So don't tell me you can't do them bothyou can't do them both.
Anyway, thank you for your time. Thank you for your help. Thank you for everything you've done for me.
And I'm fully awareand I mean it sincerelyI wouldn't be standing here without many of you in this room. You're the onethere's an old expression in the steel town I grew up in in Delaware, called Claymont: Y'all brung me to the dance.
So thank you very, very, very much.

2023-06-20 00:00:00,"Remarks at a Campaign Reception in San Francisco, California","
Well, thank you very much.
Look, I got my instructions: I'm going to be very brief with my comments, and then I'm going to go answer any questions you want for as long as you want me to answer. Okay?
First of all, you know, I want to thank you for your collective passion. This is something that's not just for an issueI mean, you know, a campaign. It goes well beyond that.
We all know the only really existential threat to humanity is 1.5 degrees Celsius. I really mean it. And I believe it; I've believed it for a long time.
And I've gone to all the COP meetings, and I think that the combination of the international recognition coupled with whatthere's not many climate deniers any longer. There are selfish people who don't want to do what we have to do on climate because it's helping them initially, but they have no doubt of the danger that's being posed. And think how quickly that's changed. Not a joke.
You know, it wasI've now flown over in a helicopter more territory that was burned to the ground, more timber burned to the ground, than the entire number of square acres in the State of Marylandtook it all. It's like burning the whole State down. That just happened in the last yearalmostnot quite 2 years, from New Mexico and Arizona, all the way up into the West Coast, including Nevada, including areas that go up into Washington State, Montana, Idaho, et cetera. And it's real.
When I was inout in California and in Colorado, I was saying, ""You know, I'm worried that we're going to lose the Colorado River."" The whole damn river. Not a joke. People looked at me like I wasI was on something.
Butso people are finally realizing what you've known for a long time: We don't have a lot of time. We don't have a lot of time.
We're in a situation where, as I said, if we don't get it right in the next 5 yearsand we're on target in the United States; we're not on target other places in the world. I've gone to every COP meeting.
You know, when I firstwhen I first got elected, the first thing I did was rejoin theyou know, the Paris Agreement. Well, you know, we've come a long way. But one of the things that's happening now is thatthat's good is that the Inflation Reduction Act wasremember they said we couldn't get that done? Well, $369 billionbillion, as in ""b,"" dollars. And that, by 2030, we're going to be reducing emissions by 1 billion tons a year.
And we have attracted $470 billion in private investment, much of it for clean energy. We're also in a situation where we have created more solar factories in the Midwest and the South, moreand wind farms across the Plains and off the shores, electric vehicle plants and clean steel, clean cement.
I thought I knew a lot about this beginning back in the eighties, but I had never thoughtI never realized how much is emitted in the air by the production of cementcement. And so, we're changing our trade policy relative to that and a whole range of other things.
Lookand you know, the tax cut is for families to buy energy-efficient appliances. People are picking up on it. They don'tnot sure why they're able to do it. They're not sure it's the Inflation Reduction Act, but they know it's working. They know it's working.
You know, when you talk about it to most people, you say: ""Look, if you put in new windows and doors and youwe'll give you a tax credit for doing it. You get a tax credit. If you put solar panels on the roof, you get a tax credit. You buy an energy-efficient appliance, you get a tax credit."" And all of a sudden, that's working. That's working in a pretty big way right now.
But you know, weand, by the way, I set out to conserve more land. The goal I set when I got electedno oneno reason why anybody would remember because they didn't think it was impossiblethat by 2030 I would, in fact, conserve at least 30 percent of all our land and all our waters off the shore of the United States of America. Andbut we're on track to do it. I won't go through all of it, butnow.
And I know there's a concern about Willow up in Alaska. Well, here'sthe legal judgment I got: There were four of thesefive of these wells, plus where it would leak into the lake andanyway, if we had denied it all, there was an even chance we'd lose in court. And so we provided for oneone well.
And in the meantime, I took 23 million acres in the region and put it off limits23 million acres[applause]in North Slope and the Tongass Forest and Bristol Bay.
You know, and after leading the world, we'reand we're leading the world and we've moved, as I said, to reenter Paris. We have mobilized the world's leading emitters and the poor countries to deal with climate change.
One of the things we didremember, everybody, the other team making fun of ""Build Back Better,"" mythat phrase? Well, guess what? We'rewe, the United States, spent a lot of time doing everything to cause this problem. We're a bigmajor cause of the problem. What the hell do we expect?
In Africa, for example, there's going to be a billion people in Africaa billion people by the end of this decade. And guess what? They didn't do a damn thing to cause it. But guess what? They don't have any money for infrastructure. They don't have any money to deal withdeal with what they need.
So we're buildingfor example, we're going to build awe'reI've gotten other nations together, and we're going to build the largest solar facility in the world in Angola. We're going to be in a position where it's fundamentally changeI won't go on. I'm talking too much.
But you know, and at the U.N. conference in Scotland, we launchedwell, one of you already raised thisthe mobile methanethe Global Methane Pledge. Recruited over 100 countries to follow our lead. But I've learned today from one of you that you now have oversight using the satellites thatthere's a hell of a lot of methane that's still emitting in areas of the United States where major corporate interests exist.
I got it started by making sure that we are in a position that we're capping all those oil and gas wells in Western Pennsylvania and Northern VirginiaWest Virginia, and throughout the country.
And the point that I was making earlier is that, you know, we ought to beI think we're going to be in a position to have 100 percent clean energyand I'll talk about it if you want to talk about it laterbyclean100 percent clean energy by 2035 in the United States. One hundred percent. And I explain why: all-electric vehicle future, 500,000 charging stations.
You know, one of the things that MAGA Republicans tried to do during the debt ceilingthey tried to blackmail me. No, I'm serious. Every one of theevery one of thesepieces of legislation that got passed, they wanted to wipe out as a condition of not reneging on the debt, from the Inflation Reduction Act to the infrastructure legislation, across the board. That waseverybody kind of forgets that was the demand.
They're coming back at it now, by the way. They're coming back at it again. And you know, they had a bull's-eye.
And, I mean, think about a couple of things, and then I'll stop, because I know you have questions.
You knowI know that you sawread in the New York Times four Mondays ago, and then it was a couple of times since then, that, you know, one of the largest producers ofof clean energyand it'sby the way, it's a hell of a lot cheaper: Solar is cheaper. [Laughter] Wind is cheaper. It doesn't cause cancer.
But all kidding aside, look what's happened: We're in a situation where we havein Texas, they have one of the largestthey haveI forget the percentage now ofwhat the percentage is. But somethingmore than half of all their energy is produced by wind and solar. And guess what? Their legislature is trying to stop it.
Talk about mindless. No, I'm not joking. Not a joke. Not a joke.
So, folks, you know, greed still drives some people. But the point thatand I'll conclude with this point and stop: One of the things thatI think some of you may recall there was some frustration that I didn't announce mywhen I was running the first timethe detail of my environmental plan, initially. And that was for a simple reason: I wanted to make sure that I was able to get labororganized labor and environmental groups on the same page.
They said: ""What are you doing? No one is going to do that."" Well, I spent a lot of time with the IBEW, and I said, ""Guys, your future lies in solar and wind andand alternative energy. It doesn't rely on the fossil fuel industry."" And I pointed out to them what was happening.
The end result was we were able to pass legislation that provided for building 550,000550,000 charging stations.
But, by the way, all of a sudden, if you noticename me a time when you ever thought you'd see within a matter of a week a Presidential nominee endorsed by the environmental community, endorsed by the AFL-CIOall of themand endorsed by some of the business communities. Because it'speople are figuring it out. They're figuring it out.
And so I think we have enormous opportunitiesenormous opportunities. We still have a long way to go, and I waswell, I'll tell you later.
But Russia is still a gigantic problem, not just in their energy production but in methane. The last time I met with Putin was in Geneva, before he invaded. And I told himI said: ""You're in eight time zones. And guess what? The entire Arctic Circle is melting. Methane is coming out of the ground more rapidly than you can possibly stop it. It's not going to refreeze. It's not going to change. It's not going to happen."" I said, ""You've got a real problem, and the world has got a problem.""
I've had the same conversation on a slightly different perspective with Xi Jinping. Withas my uncle would say, with the grace of God, the good will of the neighbors, and the creek not rising, I think John Kerry is going to be going back there pretty soon.
So there is a growing recognition that we have to do three things. One, we have to significantly eliminate the use of fossil fuels. But by the way, you can't eliminate it all right now. It doesn't make even sense to do it all right now, even if you couldnumber onebut continue to fundamentally change the mix.
Number two, we have to make sure we're in a situation where we are investing in the Global South by providing them the wherethe financial wherewithal to be able to do what they need to do to deal with it. They want to deal with it. They want to deal with it.
Butfor example, I had a long talk with Lula in Brazil. You know, that youthis is one I already said. I don't have to explain this to you. It's the largest carbon sink in the world. They absorb more carbon out of the air than we pollute in 1 day, every day. And yet, understandably, if you're them, why can't we do what you did? Clear everything. Why can't we do what you did?
So we should be providing and I think the international community should be providing compensation for them for not doing what they're doing, et cetera. Anyway, I'veanyway, I'll stop. [Laughter]
I'll answer any questions you have. Thank you.

2023-06-19 00:00:00,"Remarks on Efforts To Combat Climate Change in Palo Alto, California","
Well, thank you, Chiena, for that introduction.
Governor Newsom, I tell you what, it's nice to be here, as you said, working on something that's a positive thing going forward and not fixing something that happened veryvery badly. We've spent a lot of time in helicopters flying over areas that needed helped.
Folks, I want to thankAnna, thank you, kid. [Laughter] You've been incredible. You've been a friend for a long, long time in the Congress, when I was in the Senate. And you've done remarkable work. You've partnered on everything from protecting the environment to providingimproving the lives of the people in this district.
And thanks to all the climate leaders that are here today.
You know, we just visited the salt marsh, as you saw. We walked down to the end of the Safety Bay ProjectSafer Bay Project, anda public-private partnership that's harnessing the nature of our ability to do what this young woman, Chiena, did.
You know, one of theI always sayI neverand I mean it sincerely: I've been around a long time in public life. I got elected when I was about your age, when I was 28 years old. And you know what? I've never been more optimistic. I'veyou and I were talking about the privately. I swear to God, I've never been more optimistic in my life.
And the reason I'm optimistic is because of this generation. It's the best educated, the most engaged, the most involved, and the most consequential. They're inthey're in. The Governor was telling me about when they announced the program, there was 3,000 slots, and about 10,000 people immediately signed on or tried to sign on.
Well, look, these wetlands act as a critical buffer between the rising tides and the communities at risk, protecting homes, property, and infrastructure against flooding. They also absorb carbon dioxide from the air. And we're right next to Route 101, andwhere cars and trucks emit a lot of carbon pollution.
What we're seeing here is an amazing success story of how you can work together to make our communities more climate-resilient. It matters. It matters. Resiliency matters.
You know, I've toured many sites across the country that clearly show climate change is a genuineis the existential threat to humanity. The existential threat to humanity.
Here in California, the Governoryou and I stood together with first responders near Monterey Bay after touring the damage that was done. The devastating storms caused historic flooding that killed 21 people. That comes on the heels of the worst droughts in California in more than a millennia and the highest sea-level rise in more than a century.
I've seen wildfire devastation across the West, burning more acres to the ground than there are square miles in the State of Maryland. That's how much got burned to the ground and all thejust flying over, just devastating.
There's been historic tornadoes and flooding in the Midwest and the Southeast.
And just last week, across the East Coast and Midwest, we saw what you've already seen here in California: millions of Americans sheltering indoors, the air not safe to breathe, orange haze covering the sky. It's incredible.
By the way, to address those wildfire smoke that's coming from Canada, we're sharing cutting-edge technology that's already used here in California to help detect early fires and help them in sending, in addition to that, firefighters and tankers as well.
Folks, the impacts we're seeing in climate change are only going to get more frequent and more ferocious and more costly. Last year alonelast year alone, natural disasters in America caused $165 billion in damage, just last year alone$165 billion in damage. But the worsening impacts are not inevitable.
Building on our incredible effort locally, my administration is doing all we can to help recover and build so we can be prepared toand adapt. You know, it's all part of my ""Invest in America"" agenda the Governor was referencing. It starts with the most significant climate investment law ever anywhere in the history of the world. Over billions and billions$368 billion369, to be precisein clean energy development, environmental justice, conservation, and so much more.
We will cut 1 billion tons of carbon emission a year, create millions of good-paying jobs. And it's already attracting billions of dollars in the private sector, because businesses are realizing it's overwhelmingly in their interest. As a matter of fact, a couple of businesses are suing banks because they want to consider whether or not they're environmentallyanyway. I won't get into all that. I'll get[laughter].
But I want to emphasize again: We're taking the most aggressive climate action ever. It's focused on mitigationwhich means historic investments in developing clean energy by reducing dependence on fossil fueland resilience, which means communitiescommunitiescan better withstand the impacts of climate change and extreme weather.
With a combination of the bipartisan infrastructure law and the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS and Science Act, we've invested more than $50 billion so far in climate resilience; nearly $9 billion to make transportation infrastructure more resilient by elevating roads and bridges above projected flood zones; $13 billion to decrease the wildfire risk and improve forest health and paying for firefighters who risk their lives every day.
Drought mitigation: $15.4 billion to bolster the West's resilience to drought. These investments are being made in the context of a megadrought affecting the Colorado River Basin.
Forty million40 millionAmericans already drinking water that thousands of farmers rely on forfor integration [irrigation; White House correction]. And 40 million count on that river, and so do the farmers.
Six-point-six billion dollars in coastal resilience restoration of reefs and construction of other infrastructure to mitigate storm damage, plus more than $17 billion from the bipartisan infrastructure law to bolster resilience for coastal water and waterways infrastructure, including funding to address food, floods, storms, hurricane risks, and restore coastal ecosystems.
Climate-smart agriculture: nearly $20 billion in funding for precisionirrigation and planting cover crops, plus a $1 billion America the Beautiful Challenge to accelerate locally led conservation efforts.
Folks, flood mitigation: $3.5 million [billion; White House correction] to reduce or eliminate the risk of repetitive flood damage to buildings, plus $1 billion in funding mitigation measures to increase community resilience, like supporting adaptations of hazard-resistant building codes.
And maybe most important, I've committed that by 2020 [2030; White House correction], we will have conserved 30 percent of all the lands and waters the United States has jurisdiction over and simultaneously reduce emissions to blunt climate impacts.
And we're on our way. Conservation of land and waterwe put more in conservation of land and water than any President in the history of the United States sincebut John Kennedy.
And we're leading the way in Palo Alto and East Palo Alto and to Belle Haven. For instance, a local nonprofit called Climate Resilient Communities gives communities[applause]. Thank you. Are you all part of that? Thank you. It gives members a voice in planning and adaptation.
I'm here today to announce that we're putting our critical climate investment to work.
Folks, first, starting tomorrow, the Department of Commerce will launch the first and largest competitive Climate Resilience Regional Challenge to provide $600 million to coastal and Great Lake communities that are building projects to protect against the impacts of climate change from sea-level rise, flooding, and storm surge.
We're investing in the people and places that have been hit the hardest, but who are also on the frontlines of leading us forward.
Folks, the second thing we're doing: The Department of Energy is going to announce that it's investing more than $2 billion to modernize our electric grid to be more climate resilient, including more than $67 million starting off in California.
That funding can help ensure our electric grid is stronger, that the lights and air conditioning and internet stay on during heat waves and storms and other climate events, so the lights can stay on in hospital operating rooms, nursing homes, and so many other critical care facilities.
And third, later this year, we're hosting the first-ever White House summit that convenes local, State, Tribal, and Territorial leaders focused on climate resilience.
It's going to include a roadmap for how these historic climate actions are going to build more climate-resilient communities all across America, saving lives and homes and providing peace of mind.
This is how we're going to meet the moment. This is how we're going tounfortunately, some of our MAGA Republican friends in Congress are continuing to try to undo all the progress we've already made in the first 2 years.
They were holding the country hostage over the debt limit unless I would gut the climate provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act. I was determined not to let that happen. With your significant helpand I mean that sincerelyall of you here, particularly Anna in the House and the Congress, we didn't let it happen.
And in the end, we didn't just protect some of the climate money and clean energy provisions. We protected every single, solitary one.
But this ain't your father's Republican Party. [Laughter] They're back at it again with another bill to repeal the same provisions. But with your help, we're going to stop them again.
Let me close with this. Throughout our history, we're the only nation in the world that has come out of every crisis we've entered stronger than we went into it.
We're doing it again here on the climate crisis.
When I think of climate, I think of jobs. When I think of climate, I think of innovation. When I think of jobsclimate, I think of turning peril into progress.
That's why I'm so optimistic about the future. I really am.
We just have to remember who in hell we are. We're the United States of America, for God's sake. There is nothingnothing, nothingbeyond our capacity if we work together.
And that's what all of you are doing herehave been doing and we're going to continue to do. And God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.
Let's go get 'em. Let's get this done.

2023-06-19 00:00:00,"Remarks at a Campaign Reception in Los Gatos, California","
Well, Shannon and Kev, thank you very, very much. And I want to thank your family for all you've been willing to do and standing up and speaking out.
You know, it is true thatI remember when I ran the first time, I made a speech at Independence Hall withone night, with a wholeI don't know how many peoplefive, six, seven hundred people. And I talked about that I thought democracy was at risk, and I defined what I thought democracy was.
And the press, understandably, was somewhat skeptical why the heck I was talking about democracy the way I did. It turns out, after that speech was over, for the next couple of weeks, it turned out, there were over 65 percent of the American people registered, saying that they were concerned as well.
You know, we're the most unique nation in the history of the world. We're uniquely a product of our political institutions, unlike any other nation. I mean, not that we're better or worse, just unique. We're in a situation where the vast majority of countries are formed based on ethnicity, on religion, on all things that don't relate to anything other than an idea.
We're based on an idea that we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men and women are created equal, et cetera. And we've never fully lived up to it, but we've never in the pastsince, I guess, way back in the Civil Warwalked away from it. We've never walked away from it.
And so I'll tell you a quick story. When Iwhen you got me elected, and you didwhen you got me elected, I walked inI didn't realize, even though I'd been in the Oval Office every day for 8 years in a row, 9 o'clock in the morning with BarackI didn't realize there was a requirement that the outgoing President be out of the office by 10 o'clock on the 20th and the incoming President could come inI think it was at 3 or 4 o'clock.
And so I asked my brother Jim, who has better taste than I do, to set up the office for me, from everything from picking the rug, to the desk, and that kind of thing. For real. And he brought along with him a Presidential historian named Jon Meacham. And Jon Meacham was helping out, and I was unaware of that at the time.
And so when I came in that day, the other guy didn't have to worry; he never showed up at all. But[laughter].
But at any rate, what happened was that I looked over at the mantelpiece. And a couple of you have been to the Oval since then; you're all welcome, by the way. I mean that sincerely.
Thethere's a picturea big portrait ofpaintinga big oneof Roosevelt. Well, I'm proud Roosevelt was a Democratic President, but I wondered why. And then there were four portraits that are much smaller: one, George Washington, which had always been over the mantel; and then one of Abraham Lincoln; and then oneand thenanyway, without going into all the detail, the bottom line was, I said, ""Why?""
And Meacham spoke up and he said: ""Well, not since Dwight""not sinceexcuse me, not since Roosevelt has any President inheritedsuch a circumstance internationally, where there was so much at stake, in terms of the world economy as well.
And then I said, ""Why Lincoln?"" He said, ""Well, the country has never been as divided since then."" And I started thinking about it.
But I announced when I ran, the first timeI said I was running for three reasons, and I meant it: One was to restore the soul of the Nation. By that, I meant restore the sense of dignity and honor, be that we would once again be looked at as a nation that was one that led by example a little bit. Secondly was to rebuild the middle class, which had taken a real hit the previous number of years. And the third reason was to unite the country again.
And the press, understandably, wasand a lot of people who were supporting me thought: ""Well, I'm not sure that makes any sense, especially the uniting part. No one can unite the country."" But I'm convinced that the vast majority of the American people still understand who we are and what we're about.
And so what we did was, when we, in fact, put together this program, the initiatives we had, was I said that we were going to move in a bipartisan way.
Well, guess what? We inherited a circumstance where we hadthe economy was in disarray; we werewe had an ""American first"" policy that was not doing very well around the world from our allies, fromanyway, not doing very well.
And in addition to that, we found ourselves in a circumstance where it was very difficult to convince the American people that we could get things done.
And so we worked very hard. And we ended up in the first almost, I guess, 20 months22 months initiallynow it's longercreating more jobs than any President has in 4 years: over 13 million 500 thousand jobs.
We also put ourselves in the position where we found ourselves inhaving toa circumstance where we were once again beginning to be respected by the rest of the world.
I've spent, I figureI think theymy staff figured it out: With other NATO and European and Far East leaders, but particularly heads of state in thein Europe, I've spent over 180 hours with them, either together in a group, individually, or on Zoom. Because they really are looking to what we think is important, what we thinkwhat we're willing to do.
When I first got to the first G-7 meetingthat's the seven largest economiesin London, in February, after I was elected, I sat down at a roundliterally, a round table. It was a beautiful area we were sitting in, outside andin southwest LondonI mean, southwest England.
And I said, ""Well, America is back."" And Macron looked at me, and he said, ""For how long?"" [Laughter] For how long? He wasn't being a wise guy; he wasit was genuine questions.
And then I got a comment from a guy I'd become friends with, Scholz of Germany, the Chancellor. He said: ""Mr. President, what would you think if tomorrow morning you picked up the paper here in the England, and the London Times had said, 'A thousand people broke down the doors of Parliament; killed several bobbies in order to overthrow the election'""? And I hadn't thought of it that way before.
But think how the rest of the world looked at what happened here, without makingblaming anybody, just what happened. What happened.
And so what we didwe worked very hard to try to bring our allies back together, which I think we have; unite the world. We have the idea of when I was toldand I was told, folks, I was going to try to get Japan engaged and change their attitude and budgetattitude toward Korea, their budget, in terms of their military budget and their engagement in Europe.
It's never happened before. Well, it's happened. They're engaged in a big way. In a big way. They've actually made an rapprochement with Chinawith thewithexcuse me, with South Korea after all these years since World War II. Things are moving.
Things are moving in terms of what's happening as well in Europe, in terms of the NATO cohesion, et cetera. We've got the Quad going.
My generic point isI guess the reason why I'm so optimistic is, the rest of the world is like everybody else: They want to get something done. They want to get back to some sense of normality. And, for example, the idea that there is this cohesion in Europe stilland remember, everyone assumed, and it was not an irrational assumption, that Putin was convinced that he could wait and just see NATO break up over the issue of Ukraine.
Soand then, at home, similar things happened. The idea that in a 1-week span every major environmental group would endorse me, and then the verythe following week, I'd be endorsed by a group of people whowhere you think would behave trouble with environmental groupsthe major labor unions, every major labor union in America for the first time this early. And thiscoherently supported a candidate.
And then wethe same thing acrossI guess what I'm trying to say is, I think there's a hunger for a unity based on rationality, not based on just unity for unity's sake, because people know that we've lost something when we lost that sort of centerhow can I say it?that glue that kind of held democracyrock bottom, as to who we were.
And so I'm confident about this election because of the people I'm standing before. But I don't mean I'm that kind of confident. But I'm confident because I think that there is a sense of wanting to finish the job.
We've created, as I said, 1-pointexcuse me, 13.4 million jobs, 800,000 manufacturing jobs. Inflationunemployment is down to near historic low, at 3.7 percent. Black unemployment low, Hispanic unemployment is extremely low, relative to where we are. Inflation is down 11 months in a row. You are a lot of veryyou're all very successful business women and men. You understand that everything is fragile.
But I think if we keep moving, we can get things done. And let me end by saying the things I want to get done.
I think it's critically important that we lock down thehow can I say it?the sensethe idea that there are more children being killed in America by gunshots than by any other[inaudible]it just makes no sense. I own two shotguns. I'm not a big hunter, but I used to target shoot.
But the point I'm making is that the idea that you could drive your car up here, park your car, and if some 14-year-old kidif you left the key in, it took the car and ran it off the road here and hurt somebody, you'reyou're civilly liable.
Well, you should have to lock up your guns. What's the big damn deal about that? Look at all theseall theseall these kids who have blown people away, large numbers.
You know, we should be in a position where we have universal background checks. We should be in a position where the idealook, AR-15s are weapons of war. And I think the reason whyand I think it's going to become clear pretty soonthe reason why: The only industry in America you can't sue is the gun manufacturers. Imagine if that were the law with regard towith regard to tobacco. How many people would be dead today, thatare alive because we've been able to take on tobacco?
And so there are so many things we can do in that area.
We can alsoit's about time that the ultimatefreedomthe right to choose should be a right left between a woman and her doctor. And so the idea is that now we're in a position where it's been ruled that it's not a constitutional guarantee, not guaranteed by theno place in the Constitution that guarantees it for the first time in 50-some years. It's pulled away.
So there's nothing that you're going towe're not going to be able to pass a constitutional amendment, but I'll tell you what we can do: We can pass a national law taking Roe v. Wade and codifying it in every State and making sure, if you have a majority of the Statesand we're going to be in a position where that becomes the law of the land.
But my point is thatthink of all theall the horror stories you've heard, not just the normal ones, but you know, a young womanpeople moving from one State to another.
You have a guy froma former football coach from Alabama is holding upI think it'sI'll ask my sonI think it's 57 flag appointmentsmilitary appointments for the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on down the line. Because the military said if you are in the military, you're having a troubled pregnancy, and you're in a State where you're not allowed to see the doctor perform anyany remedial operation on you, then you can get paidyou can have leave to go to where you can do that.
Well, he said, unless that's changed, he's holding up all theall thesewe're in awe're in aI mean, it'sit's just bizarre. I don't remember it happening before. And I've been around. I know I don't look like I've been around[laughter]but I've been around. I've been around a long time.
But the point I'm making is, there are so many things that are of consequence that we can solve. And the vast majority of people, all the data shows, support the positions we're generically taking. It's not like these are wacko ideas that we've come up with.
And so I think it's really important we sort of reinstill a sense of, I don't knowa sense of confidence in the Constitution, even though people don't think of it in exactly those terms.
But I'm basicallynow I'm talking too much. And the view is incredible. [Laughter] My view isI see you and theand the environmentyou have a bad view. You only see me. [Laughter]
But all kidding aside, whywhat am I supposed toam I going to takeBoss, come on up here, man.

2023-06-19 00:00:00,"Remarks at a Campaign Reception in Atherton, California","
The President. Steve, thank you. I used to dream of being charismatic. [Laughter] Anyway. All kiddingthank you. Thank you, thank you.
By the way, there's the real reason we're gathered here: We have two recent college graduates in the front row here. Stand up, guys. No, you got to stand up. I'm going to embarrass you. Stanford and Cal. That's the only reason I came out. I want to get to know who's going to be running the country later.
So Ilook, I want to thank Anna for allowing me toa passport into the district. Thank you, Anna. We've been working together a long, long time.
And the fact of the matter is that, you know, Anita is here somewhere. I don't know where there you are, Anita. Well, I tell you what: You're the only reason I came out. [Laughter] Thank you. Nono, you've beenyou've been wonderful.
And I want to thank everyone here because, quite frankly, I wouldn't be standing here talking to you were it not for most of the people in this room. A lot of you have been helping me for a long, long time. I go back 217 years, to Joe Cotchett. [Laughter] JoeJoe and I go back a long way. But I'm seriouslooking around the room, some of you've been with me a long time, and I truly appreciate it.
You knowyou know, a lot of world leaders I'vethe only thing that comes with serving a long time in office is you get to know a lot of people. And I've had an opportunity to meet virtually every world leader in the past 35 years or more. And one of the things that I get askedwell, let me put it this way: I waswhen Barack was President and I was Vice President, it was clear that President Huand that was his name at the time, the President of Chinaand his Vice President, Xiwhere Xi was going to be the successor, Vice President to become President in the near term.
And it wasn't appropriate for Barack to be able to spend a lot of time getting to know him, so it was an assignment I was given. And I traveled 17,000 miles with him, usually one on one. IweI'd have a simultaneous interpreter, and he had one too. And we got to know each other fairly well.
And one of the thingswe were in the Tibetan Plateau, and he asked me one day, and he saidone of our meetingshe said, ""Can you define America for me?"" And this is the God's truth. I said, ""Yes, in one word."" He said, ""What's that?"" I said, ""Possibilities.""
In America, we are the ""ugly Americans"" because we believe anything is possible when we work together. I'm being deadly earnest now. Think about it. When has there ever been a problem that we've decided to take on we thought we couldn't solve? As hard as it would be, whenwhen did that ever happen? And it hadn't happened.
There's never been a time when we haduntilof late, until the last time around, when we decided we're going to go it alone, ""America first."" We found ourselves in the position where there wasn't much coordination, and we stopped talking to one another.
You know, I told this story before: WhenI learned early on thatafter 8 years of sitting in the Oval Office every single morning at 9 o'clock with Barack, there were two questions he'd ask. We'd start off with kidding each other. He said, ""What do you think the temperature is in Hawaii?"" And I said, ""78."" [Laughter] That was ayou think I'm kidding. I'm not.
And then I'd say to himand I'd say, ""Remember, Barack,""I just called him Mr. President. ""Remember, Mr. President, all politics is personal,"" both international and national. You get togot to know the other team. You've got to know the other person, what's motivating that person and what's not motivating that person.
And so we spent a lot of time trying to figure out where this relationship was going to go, not only with China, but with Russia. You may remember, when I became President, I checked with the intelligence community to see if I couldwithout anyhurting any one individual, to letthe world know that for the first time since World War II, 135,000 people were going to invade another country.
And I said and I predictedand I toldat the time, it was cleared. And I told the Ukrainians that they were going to be invaded. They didn't believe it either. But for the first time, we hadeverno one contemplated the notion that there would be a Russian army that would invade another country with a hundredit ended up being 185,000 people.
The point I'm trying to make is this: You know, there's amy colleagues in the Senate used to always kid me because I was always quoting Irish poets. They thought I quoted Irish poets because I'm Irish. That's not the reason; they just happen to be the best poets in the world. [Laughter]
But Seamus Heaney, a poetand his wife I got to know very well after he passed awayhe wrote a poem called ""The Cure at Troy,"" and he said: ""All's changed, changed utterly. A terrible beauty has been born.""
All has changed, has changed utterly, both good and bad. It's a different world.
When I was deciding whether or not to run in nineteenturned arounddecided to run in 2020, I wasn't sure what to do, whether I was going to run or not. Because then I wasI started to write a book on whatAmerican inflection points, the things thatthose are things that occur within a relatively short span of time, less than a decade, that change the world for the next three, four, or five decades. It's happened about eight times in modern history. And we're at one of those junctures, in my view.
And then what happened was, along came what happened in Charlottesville. And that young woman that I metthe mom of the young woman who was killed. And the President was askedand those folksremember, they came walking out of theout of the woods, the fields, carrying torches, singing the same anti-Semitic bile that was sung inin Germany in the thirties and accompanied by White supremacists in the Ku Klux Klan. And my predecessor was asked, ""Well, whatwhat do you think?"" He said there were very good people on both sides.
That's when I knew things hadhad begun to change in a way that wasif we didn't move, it would be irreversible over a period of time.
And the reason I bother to say those things to you is, I think there's enormous prospects that we have as a consequence of the changes that you helped allow us to begin. Begin, not end. Begin. And many of those changes relate tothink about it: You know, we're toldI said I was running for three reasons, and a lot of you helped me last run.
I said I was running for three reasons. One, to restore the soul of this country. And that was to restore a sense of decency and honor and be able to talk with one another, be able to communicate back and forth with one another. The second reason was toto build the economy from the middle out and the bottom up, because when that happens, you all do very well, the wealthy do very well, and the middle class has a shot. And the disaffection of the middle class was growing, growing deeply. The percentage of the working class, high-school-educated population that voted Democrat was overwhelming. But they began to be left behind, not intentionally but it was the effectthat was a fact.
And think what we inherited when we came to office: an economy in disarray, a circumstance where we were the ""America first"" crowd. We weren'twe were justwe were disregarded, quite frankly, by the vast majority of our allies around the world.
And if you think I'm exaggerating, I'm not. The first meeting I attended as a U.S.as the United States President was in England, in the southeast of Francesoutheast of England, for the G-7 meeting, all thethe seven largest economies. And I sat down. We were seven of us at a round table. And I sat down, and I said, ""America is back."" And the French President looked at me and he said: ""For how long? For how long?""
And then the Chancellor of Germany looked at menew to the job himselflooked at me, and he saidhe said: ""What would you think, Mr. President, if tomorrow you woke up and in the London Times the headline was, 'A thousand people broke into the Parliament, broke down the doors of the House of Commons, two bobbies were killed, and in the process, they tried to stop the transfer of power'? What would you think?""
And I hadn't thought of it that way before, and I don't know that any of you have. Imagine the impact it's had on the rest of the world. The United States, all of a sudden, January 6I'm not trying to make a legal case, I'm just talking about the course of history. Imagineimagine how we'd feel if that was the case.
And so I had two jobs you elected me to do. First was to reestablish American leadership in the world, not so we could beat our chestsbecause if we don't do it, no one gets it done. No one has the influence, the power, the consequence, or the history to get it done. Nobody. It doesn't mean we're better than anybody else. It meansbut we are more unique than anybodythan another country.
You know, there's aevery other country in the world is based on theirtheir country, as a consequence of ethnicity, religion, geographyor something other thanother than geography. And we're the only country in the world that we're united based on an idea. That's whatand that's not hyperbole, that's a fact. Think about it. The only country organized based on an idea: that we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men and women are created equal, endowed by their Creator with certain rights, et cetera, et cetera.
We've never lived up to it, but we never walked away from it completely. And we've been thewe've been the linchpin that most democracies around the world look to to keep things moving. Madeleine Albright was right when she said we're the essential nation.
And so the point I'm trying to make here is that we had an obligation to try to reunite the world. I have spent, because of your helpI haven't been ableI've spent over now, they tell me, about 180 hours with European heads of state and allies, including the Japanese as well, who have come alongcome along a big way. And in terms of pulling these countries together.
If you notice, Putin was certain when hevirtually certain when he invaded that he was going to split NATO, that NATO would never stay together. NATO is more united than it's ever been in an entire history of NATO, because we've worked together. And it's critically important, and that was the job that I had.
I'm going to say something outrageous. I think I know as much about American foreign policy as anybody living, including Dr. Kissinger. That's what I've done my whole lifefor the last 270 years. [Laughter]
But the second pointthe second thing was, we had to figure out how to unite the country. And the press, understandablyit's not aI'm not criticizing the press when I say thisthe press sort of made light of my saying we've got to unite America. How can a democracy function without thewithout the consent of the Government, without cooperation? How does that work? I don't know any place that ever worked.
And so we spent a lot of time working on that. And when I said, Joe, that we're going to have bipartisanship, people looked at me like I was crazy. Because remember, they said: ""Well, Biden was a real bipartisan leader when he was a Senator. And he was known for being able to[inaudible]. But this is different."" Well, guess what? We came up with a trillion-200-billion-dollar bipartisan infrastructure bill. It's going to change[applause].
How in God's namehow in God's namecan we lead the world when we rank numberI think it's 16 in quality of infrastructure? How does that happen? It doesn't happen.
And we used to invest a significant amount of ourout of our entire GBTGDP, we invested on average 2 percent of our GDP on research and development. I'm in the middle of Silicon Valley; you guys have forgotten more about this than most people around the world know. No, I'm not beingI'm not being solicitous. I'm being deadly earnest.
But we stopped doing it; 0.7 percent was the max we, in fact, invested in research and development in America. The United States of America. So that's why I came up with this legislation relating to how we're going to deal with the whole notion of dealing with investments.
And, for example, when we did thewhen I put together a legislationor proposed the legislation relating to dealing with computer chips, sources ofyou know, we talked aboutyou all understood, but a vast majority of people in America don't understand what talking about source of product is. And we never talked about source before.
But, all of a sudden, we found ourselvesand we invented the computer chip. We used to have25 years ago, we produced 40 percent of the chips, which are needed for virtually everything now, as youI need not tell any of you. Well, guess what? We were down to 10 percent. How can thathow could that have happened?
So we changed the law. We invested significant amounts of money. We attracted $450 billionbillion dollars in private sector investment in that. $450 billion.
We're in a situation now where we have awe have overall thelook, $300 billion just for building fabs, justbuilding chip factories now.
You know, there's a situation[applause]but the reason why I thought that was so important, beyond America's place in the world, was, you know, we kept losing those blue-collar workers.
You know, my dad used to say: ""Joey a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay. We're going to make it.'""
We'll, they're stripped of their dignity. We started to decide to go where the labor was cheapest. We'd export jobs and import product. Well, there's a little law that existed since 1935. It says, ""Buy America."" Any moneyany amount of money that Congress gives me, I can insist that it be purchased 100-percent American manufacturer. And consistent with the WTO. I can insistbut no one was willing to do it.
Well, guess what? You better be buying American and hiring Americans. And if you don't have the capacity, we make exceptions. We make exceptions.
But, folks, the point is thatguess what?it's created thousands and thousands and thousands of jobs.
And, for example, the fab that Intel is building outside of Columbus, Ohio, that fab is employing 12,000 people: 5,000 people working in the fab when it's constructed and 7,000 people building it. Well, the 7,000 people are getting paid prevailing wage. And guess what? The 3,000the 5,000 people that are going to work, they're going to have an average salary of an excess of $120,000 a year. And you don't need a college degree.
All of a sudden, we're paying attention to blue-collar workers again. We're building the country from the middle out and the bottom up. And the wealthy are still doing very, very well.
We also did the same thing with regard towe used toyou know, the VA can negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies. Pharmaceutical companies aren't bad guys, just so they charge Americans more than anybody else. Not a joke.
The most significant medicine you needprescription you need, you can go to Toronto, Canada; Paris, France; Madrid, Spain, and buy it cheaper from the same exact manufacturer as you buy it here.
So we said, because they can negotiate drug prices for veterans, we should be able to drug negotiate drug prices for thefor Medicare. And guess what? It had the added advantage of reducing the debt by $168 billion, just as it relates to one thing: insulin.
But here's my point: My point is, we did thiswe created 13 million-plus jobs in the first 2 years, more than any President ever has in 4 yearsin 4 years. We're now in a situation wherewe're in a situation where we're able to do things that we couldn't do before.
And allthis entire period, all this spendingthe ""big-spending Biden""guess what? We reduced the debt by $1.7 trillion at the same time because of the ingenuity of the people in this room.
You know what I said when I was talking about that Intel project? Sis it SM? Whatwhatwhat's the outfit in South Korea?
Audience member. SMC.
The President. SMC. I met with the CEO of SMC in South Korea. And I said, ""Why are you making this investment?""
And they're investing a significant amount of money$100 million they committedin the ""field of dreams,"" I call it, that thousand acres just offjust west ofof Columbus, Ohio.
And I saidyou know, I asked him, ""Why are you doing it?"" And he said: ""Because it's the safest investment we can make anywhere in the world, in the United States. And secondly, you have the best, finest workers.""
Well, a lot of you probably are wondering why I'm so prounion. I'm pro- 
Audience member. Woo-hoo!
The President. I'mwell, I'm prounion for a simple reason: what people underestimateand I thinkI've watchedI've met with the Business Roundtable. I've met withand II asked them at the meeting we had with about 40 members of the Business RoundtableI said, ""You guys are wondering why I'm prounion."" I said: ""Let me ask you a question. When I was Vice President, I visitI met with 352 of you out of the Fortune 500. And I asked you one thing: 'What do you need most?'""
You know what they said: an educated workforce. But you don't educate your workforce anymore. You don't invest the money in educating your workforce.
I come from the State of DuPont: Delaware. When I got elected 200 years ago, DelawareDuPont was the eighth largest corporation in America. Every new enterprise they engaged in, they spent the money educating their own folks. Now the public gets to do it.
So why do you oppose my effort to invest more in education? And guess what? We've got support now, investing in education.
My generic point is the same. There's so much we can do. And we can do it without hurting anyone, just growing the economy.
And look, one of the things that happenedand I'll stop with thisone of the things that happened when thelet me back up so I say it this way. How many of you are not from this area?
[At this point, a phone rang.]
[Laughter] He's calling again, isn't he? He keeps calling me. I don't know why. [Laughter]
No, all kidding aside. How many you are not from Silicon Valley? And how many are you from smaller Midwestern towns or near? You know what happens when the factory closes. The soul of the community is lost. Not a joke. It's not only the loss of the jobs. It's the loss of their sense of self-worththeir sense of self-worth.
And so, one of the things we're doing now is we'reall these offices are investing throughout the Midwest, throughout the Southin the South.
Matter of fact, I'm going to show up for a major initiative and investment that's taking place in North Georgia, in the home of Marjorie Taylor Greene. [Laughter] It's a multibillion-dollarit's a multi-multimillion-dollar project. Okay? But I'm going to be there with a spade to turn the dirt, because I saidand I mean itI represent all Americans, whether they're Democrats or Republicans or whoever they are.
Because, look, we've got to unite the country. We've got to let people know what we're doing.
And soany rate, there are a number of thingsand oneone last thing I want to talk a little bit about, and then I'll hush up, because I was told that I'm not going to get to get questions from y'all.
A couple things. The environment: The existential threat to the United States and to humanity, not a joke, is environmentclimate change, if we do nothing about it.
You know, it used to be a whole hell of a lot of people who thought that climate change was not an issue. Well, I have now flown over more burned-down forest in helicoptersa lot with your Governor, I might addas a consequence of what's happened inbecause of climate change than you can imagine. As much territory, since I've come into office, has burned to the ground that makes up the entire geography of the State of Maryland. That's how much has burned to the ground in the United States.
When I was out here about 3 years ago saying I worried about the Colorado River drying up, everybody looked at me like I was crazy. They looked at me like when I said I worried about Putin using tactical nuclear weapons.
It's real. But it's all doable. We canwe can do it. We can deal with it. We can make it happen. And we can create millions of good-paying jobs.
And what we can do when we do thisand, by the way, thatwe're in a situation where, in terms of thedealing with the environment, there is a broad political coalition that's beginning to form. The idea that I was able to, for example, get endorsements by every single major environmental group and, at the same time, every major union in America. I mean, seriously, if I had said that to you 2 years ago, what are the prospects of that?
But guess what? Everybody is kind of figuring it out. And by the way, the reason I push unions so much is they're not a bunch of thugs that are portrayed by many people. What they are isthey're blue-collar workers who have to go back to college, in effect, for 3 to 5 years in an apprenticeship, getting paid less in order to get the license to be able to be an electrician, get the license to be able to bego down the list.
Anyway, I made a commitment. I made a commitment that my term as President of the United States, I was going to make sure that 30 percent of all of our lands and all of our waters under American jurisdiction would be conserved by the year 2030.
And we're on target to get it done. For example, in Cape HaleCamp Hale in Colorado, 500excuse me50,000 acres. Boundary Waters in Minnesota, 225,000 acres. Spirit Mountain in Nevada, 5,000500,000 acres. The Castner Range in Texas, over 608600excuse me6,600 acres. Alaska, 25,000 acres I put in conservation: the Tongass Forest, Bristol Bay, the AtlanticArctic Ocean, and North Slope.
In addition to that, there are multiple, multiple miles around Hawaii that are off limits now to moving in terms of anything other than conservation. And so
And, by the way, we're going to reduce emissions by 2030 in the world byof the United States by 50 to 52 percent.
We put so much money into the power grid. How many of your fires out here have been because of those high-tension wires that have come down as a consequence of storms, tornadoes, et cetera?
The end result is the power gridwe're now gettingand your power companies and others around the worldaround the country decided they're going to put it underground. It's five to six times more expensive, but, with our help, we're going to be able to get it done. It's going to save millions of acres of land.
We're in a situation where we also haveI was able to get, on the South Lawnand this is not me just reminding people, but reminding what they really were about. I got everybody lasta year ago last summer on the South Lawn, all the auto companies in Detroit. And they agreed.
Mary Robinson [Barra; White House correction], the Chairman of the Board of General Motors, was saying that she was suing the State of California because you had a higher standardemission standard than they did. And she said no State could have a standard lower than that of the United States Government.
Well, guess what? I got a phone call after that meeting with her and all these folks on the South Lawn, saying she dropped her suit and she committed to go all electric by 2035. Know what that means?
And this is why everybody was a little suspect, because I didn't announce my environmental plan immediately because I wanted to bringbe sure I was able to bring labor along, just because we needed to bring them along.
Guess what? The end result of that is thefor example, the Electrical Workers Union is going to be employbuilding 500,000 EV stations throughout the country500,000. And every bit of evidence shows that when you build the gas stations in the old days, back in the 1900s, and theguess what? You end up building the equivalent of a McDonald's. You end up building an equivalent of otherother vehiclesother stores. It builds economic growth.
And soand by the way, thewe also have in my formermy original home State of Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia, in that part of the world, we have thousands of uncapped wellsgas and oil wellsthat are just spewing methane.
Well, now we're paying the same people to dig them, to cap them. And it's going have a profound impact on the environment in those areas.
And so I guess what I'm trying to say is, you know, a comprehensive tragedystrategy hereand I'll end with this, on the environmentis that, in the real world, agriculture60,000 farms now plant cover crops, which we were talkingI was talking to someone in here about Brazilcover crops that absorb the pollution of the air, taking it into the ground60,000.
We have, as I said, a circumstance where solar panel manufacturing has increased multifold. And what they want to get rid ofguess what?you hear your neighbors who wantthey get a tax credit for putting solar panels on the roof or buying certain electric materialexcuse mecertain products that, in fact, aredon't generate as much energy intakewindows and doors, less air conditioning or heat escaping. It's having a profound impact on the consumption of energy.
We're alsoheavy industry companies are investing billions of dollars in clean construction materials, like clean steel and clean cement. I thought I knew a fair amount about the environment, about soI didn't realize until 8 years ago how muchhow much is spewed into the air as a consequence of the production of cement and steel, how much goes into the air in terms of pollution.
Well, now we're making clean steel and clean cement. So it is having a profound impact.
I guess what I'm saying is that factories all over the country and Qcell solar factories are being built. And the end result of all of this is bipartisan budget deal with nearly a trillion dollars in deficit reduction on top of the $1.7 trillion that I've already saved.
And we can do a lot more to lower costs. But, again, I'm beginning to bore myself. [Laughter]
But I guess what I'm trying to say is theand I'll end with thisthe gigantic issues of the daywhat are the things that are going to be consequential to our grandchildren and our great-grandchildren? Whether they have clean air to breathe. Whether there's a world in which it's more likely that it's status quo ante, in terms of peace sustained, or there's war. Which is it? And I think we know the answer.
And I think we're on the trail to making sure that we can do both: have a safer world because of America's engagement in a way that it has in the pastin the distant past of nowas well as making sure that we have an economy that benefits everyone, because there's nothing worse than denying somebody who's busting their neck the dignity of their job.
At any rate, I'm going to hush up. Thank you all very much.

Q. Good morning, sir.
The President. The only reason we're going to Philadelphia: It's my wedding anniversary. [Laughter] And we figured Iwith my Philly girl, we'd go to Philly. You can smile; it's okay. It's a lousy joke.
Anyway, Ithe reason I'm excited about today is, just like what we did last week in thewith the environmental groups. I thinkI'm told this is the first time ever this early that every single union has endorsed me. I've been told that's never happened before. And the good news about that is, I also met yesterday with some businesspeople. Businesspeople and unions are beginning to work together like not before.
And so I'm excited aboutthis is the beginning of something big, in terms of changing the economic balance.
2024 Presidential Election 
Q. What kind of campaign do you think you're going to have? Do you think it's going to be a nasty campaign this whole year, the way your opponent's going after you?
The President. Well, it depends on who the nominee is.
China-U.S. Relations 
Q. On China, Mr. President, can Secretary Blinken ease tensions with China on this trip, do you think?
The President. Sure. Well, look, China has some legitimate difficulties unrelating to theunrelated to the United States. And I think one of the things that that balloon caused was not so much that it got shot down, but I don't think the leadership knew where it was and knew what was in it and knew what was going on. It wasI think it was more embarrassing than it was intentional.
And so I'm hoping that, over the next several months, I'll be meeting with Xi again and talking about legitimate differences we have, but also how there's areas we can get along.
[At this point, several reporters spoke at once.]
Ukraine/North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
Q. Mr. President, are you going to make it easier for Ukraine to join NATO?
The President. No.
The President. Because they've got to meet the same standards. So I'm not going to make it easier. I think they've done everything relating to demonstrating the ability to coordinate militarily, but there's a whole issue of: Is their system secure? Is it noncorrupt? Does it meet all the standards everyoneevery other nation in NATO does?
I think they will. I think they can. But it's not automatic.
Thank you.
Russia/Nuclear Weapons 
Q. Do you have a comment on Russia's deployment of tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus?
The President. I've commented on that many times. It's totally irresponsible.

And, to the people of Philadelphia, I want to say that we're with you. We're going to stay with you andas this is rebuiltuntil it's totally finished. And we're going to try to do that in as quick a time as possible.
And I told the Governor there's no more important project right now in the country, as far as I'm concerned. I'm directing my teamnot figuratively, but literallyto move heaven and earth to get it done as soon as humanly possible.
So, since Sunday morning, we've worked closely with Governor Shapiro, Senators Casey and Fetterman, and Representative Boyleit's his districtand Mayor Kenney to provide the necessary Federal assistance to support an all-hands-on-deck response to this crisis. And it is a crisis.
And I want to thank these officials for working collaboratively, effectively, efficiently with each other and with our Federal team.
I also want to thank the firefirst responders who dealt with the immediate aftermath and the workers onsite. We saw some of them today as we flew over the site. They've been working 24/7 to clear the debris.
Within hours of the crash, officials from the U.S. Department of Transportation were on the ground, supporting Pennsylvania officials to get the site cleared and be able to start the rebuilding. The immediate release of $3 millionit was called ""quick release"" emergency fundswere made to offset the cost of repairs.
This is just a downpayment, obviously. It's a lot more than that. We're going to be getting a lot more Federal funding out the door in the coming weeks.
Additionally, Pennsylvania has already received $8.9 billion from the bipartisan infrastructure law, including $6.5 billion for transportation projects, which gives the Governor some flexibility to move existing State funds to this project right away, knowing that this money is in the bank.
Also, union crews have been hard at work 24/7 since the crash. Operating engineers, the laborers, the carpenters, cement finishers, teamsters, and the ironworkers are going to help rebuild. And they're doingthey're doing it right now.
And folks here know that the crews finished demolition on Thursday, ahead of schedule, and now they're working on emergency repairs to quickly and safely reopen the roadway to traffic.
The Federal GovernmentI've committed we're going to reimburse 100 percent of this phase of the work in well over the first 200 days. And then, after that, 90 percent of the work. We'll be here until the end. We won't leave until it's finished.
And that's why I want toI asked Mayor Landrieu, who runs my operation relative to the infrastructure legislation, to lead the effort. He knows, as mayor, what it takesMayor Kenney, as you knowto get things done. HeNew Orleans never had any problems like tornados and hurricanes and floods and the like. But, all kidding aside, he's on iton this every day.
We're using materials made of recycled glass, manufactured here in Delaware County, Pennsylvania. And the design of the project is incredibly innovative in order to get this work done in record time. We're also working with local officials to redirect traffic, minimize congestion, andalong alternative routes.
Look, I grew up not very far from here, just across the line in PennsylvaniaI mean from Pennsylvaniain Claymont, Delaware. I know how important this stretch of highway is not just to Philly, but to the entire Northeast corridor and to my home State.
Over 150,000 vehicles travel on it every day, including 14,00014,000trucks. It's critical. It's critical to our economy, and it's critical to our quality of life.
We're going to continue to do everything we can within our power to get this back open as quickly and easily as possible. We're not leaving until it's done. And we're going to get this done, God willing, in record time.
I'm looking forward to hearing more from the folks on the ground in a moment.
And now I'm going to turn it over to the Governor, who is doing one hell of a job. He gets tired of my calls, I think, but he's doing a hell of a job.
Thank you.
Gov.
Governor Joshua D. Shapiro of Pennsylvania. Thank you.
The President. There you are.
Gov. Shapiro. Thank you very much.
[At this point, Gov. Shapiro, Sens. Robert P. Casey, Jr., and John K. Fetterman, Rep. Brendan F. Boyle, and Mayor James F. Kenney of Philadelphia made remarks; no transcript was provided. Mayor Kenney concluded his remarks as follows.]
Mayor Kenney. But hethe President of the United States called me to see what he could do to help us. And that says all you need to know about this President and this man here. So thank you very much, Mr. President. We really appreciate it, and we love you. Thank you.
The President. I might add, if I didn't, I'd be sleeping alone. [Laughter] Do I have to explainI'd better explain thatsome don't know what I'm taking about. My wife's a Philly girl. [Laughter]

2023-06-17 00:00:00,"Remarks at a Campaign Rally With Union Members in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","
The President. Hello, Philadelphia! Hello, organized labor, union labor! There's labor, and there's union labor.
Folks, it feels good to be home. I'm Joe Biden. I'm Jill Biden's husband and damn proud of it. A Philly girl, a card-carrying member of her union.
And, David, thank you for that introduction. And I want to thank LizPresident Liz Shuler, who's been a friend of mine for a long, long time and all of you.
Folks, if I can go off script for a second here, I want to say something: You know, I've been doing this a long time, but I've never felt the sense of camaraderie and pride that I feel today in this year. I really mean it.
Audience member. We love you!
The President. No, no, no, no. I'm not sayingI'm not saying
Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!
The President. Let melet me just say one thing very seriously: You know, I think this is the first timeand I've been around, as I said, a whilein history where, last week, every single environmental organization endorsed me.
No, no, no. And this week, for the first time I'm aware of, the AFL-CIO endorsed this early, and every union as well. Because we're coming together.
I look out in this crowd, and I see a lot of old friends, a lot of folksas they say in Claymont, Delawarewho brung me to the dance. I told you when I ran for President I'd have your back. And I have. But you've had my back as well.
And I'm moreexcuse me for getting a little emotionalI'm more honored by your endorsement than you can imagine. Coming this early, it's going to make a gigantic difference in this campaign.
You know, there are a lot of politicians in this country who can't say the word ""union."" Because you know I'm not one of them. I'm proud to say the word. I'm proud to be the most pro-union President in American history. I promised you I would be. But what I'm really proud aboutwhat I'm really proud aboutis being reelected the most pro-union President in history.
Look, I want to thank Kamala for all she's doing to fight for working families.
Look, folks, I've said many times: Wall Street didn't build America, you did. You did. Not a joke. I've been saying this for a long time, long before I ran for President. The middle class built this country, and you built the middle class.
Electricians, carpenters, ironworkers, steelworkers, laborers, bricklayers, plumbers, pipe fitters, police officers, firefighters, educators, nurses, painters, airline workers, custodians, transit workers, steel- and metalworkers, grocery store workers, hotel workers, so many others.
Audience member. Millwrights!
The President. And let me tell you somethingmillwrights as well. [Laughter]
If the investmentthe investment bankers in this countrythink about itI mean, this is not a criticism of them, but if the investment bankers in this country went on strike tomorrow, no one would much notice in this room. [Laughter] No, think about this in a literal sense. But if this room didn't show up for work tomorrow or next Monday, the whole country would come to a grinding halt. So tell metell mewho matters more in America?
Folks, I'm looking forward to this campaign. I want you to know why: because you've got a story to tell. We've got a story to tell. We've got a record to run on. And most importantly, we're not only changing this country, we're transforming it.
Just think back: Remember what it was like when I came to officewe came into office. Remember the mess we inherited. The pandemic was raging. ThinkI want you to really think about this. I mean this sincerely. It's not a campaign speech; it's a speech about the future of this country.
The economy was reeling. Barely 3 million people had been fully vaccinated. Supply chains were broken. Businesses were shutting down. Schools were closed.
You had carsremember carsnot just old jalopies, carsmodern cars, new carslined up for miles and miles just to get a box of food put in the back of their car for their families.
Our allies in Europe and around the world heard the last President saying our foreign policy was ""America first."" And for the first time since the Second World War, our friends began to wonder whether they couldthe United States could be relied on.
Now, look at where we are today. We've united NATO once more in a way it has never been united before. It's a wonder we're[applause].
We've created 13 million new jobs since I became President. That's more jobs in little over 2 years than any President has created in one 4-year term. The unemployment rate is down to nearly a 50-year low at 3.7 percent. I've seen record lows for Black unemployment and Hispanic unemployment as well.
We've created 800,000 manufacturing jobs. And as you heard me say before: Where in God's name is it written that America can't lead the world again in manufacturing?
Inflation has come down 11 months in a row andgoing to continue to come down. Today, it's less than half of what it was 1 year ago.
Folks, this didn't just happen. We made it happen. I came to office
Audience member. You did it!
The President. No, you guys. No, I beingI'm being sincere. You guys did.
I came to office with a theory and a plan. The theory was this
Audience members. You did it!
The President. No, please listen. I mean it. I want you to listen to this one. [Laughter]
It was time to end the trickle-down economics theory: You know, the wealthy do well, we all do well.
Forty years of handing out excessive tax cuts to the wealthy and big corporations had been a bust. Democrats as well as Republicans did it. All of it had doneall it had done was hollow out the middle class; blow up the deficit; ship jobs overseas; strip the dignity and pride and hope out of a community, one after another, all across America as the factories shut down.
I'm pretty sure you saw in your home what I saw in mine. Not a lot trickled down from my parents' kitchen table when I was growing up.
So we're changing. We decided to replace this theory with what the press has now called ""Bidenomics."" I don't know what the hell that is. [Laughter] But it's working.
Let me tell you what it's about. It's about building an economyliterally, not figurativelyfrom the bottom up and the middle out, not the top down. Because when the middle class does well, everybody does well. [Applause] Nothe poor have a way up, and the wealthy don'tdothey just do just fine.
But like I said, I didn't just come into office with a theory; I came with a plan. And it started with passing the American Rescue Plan, a plan to vaccinate the Nation and get our economy going again.
And that's exactly what it did. It put money in people's pockets, provided a lifetimelifeline for businesses to stay afloat. And one study concluded that it kept 7 million people in their homesnot losing their homes.
Oh, it did one more thing that matters a lot to you: It included the Butch Lewis Act to protect the pensions of millions of workers. And that was a big deal. That was a big deal.
I committed to you, and we worked together. Youyougot that passed for me. It's one of the most significant achievements to union workers and retirees in over 50 years, and that's a God-natural fact. But not a single Republican in Congress voted for it, but we still got it done because of you[applause]because of you.
Nextnextwe passed the bipartisan infrastructure law because of you.
We can't have the strongest economy in the world without the best infrastructure in the world. How can that be? Can you believe we used to be the best infrastructurehad the best infrastructure in the world, rated number one? But today, we rate number 1313. Twelve other nations have betterand by the way, how in the hell can you grow an economy without an infrastructure? Notnot a joke.
Under my predecessor, ""Infrastructure Week"" became a punchline. On my watch, we're making ""Infrastructure Decade"" a headline. And that's what this law is all about. It's about investing in America, in our roads, bridges, ports, airports, clean water, high-speed internet, and so much more.
We've already statedstarted some 32,000 projects all across America. As Mayor Kenney knows, none of them are more consequential than right here at I-95 in Philly. In fact, if you go to invest.gov, you'll see a map that's going to show every single project in this country.
And by the way, it creates tens of thousands of good-paying jobs with prevailing wage. And you don't need a college degree to make a decent income.
You've heard me say before many times, but it sticks in my mind. My dad used to have an expressionand I swear to God this is what he would say, not a joke. He'd say: ""Joey, remember, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about being able look at your child in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay. We're going to make it.'""
That's what this is about. He was right, and I'm determined to make it a reality for every family in this country.
But look, if I needed any reminder about how important infrastructure was in the country, I got a reminder just a few days ago right here in Philly. I visited the damaged section of I-95. We're working closely with Governor Shapiro and Senator Casey and Fetterman and Congressman Boyle and Mayor Kenney to rebuild it.
I've instructed my team to prove that the old saw is wrong. I'm instructing my team to move heaven and earth to get it done. And thanks to some smart thinking and some innovative design and using materials right here in Pennsylvania, we're going to get it done in record time because it's so important to the economy not only of Philly, but the entire Northeast Corridor and every community.
Third, we passed the CHIPS and Science Act. I kept saying for a long while here: We used to be on the cutting edge of science and technology. We used to invest 2 percent of our entire GDP in research and development. You know what it is now? Got down to .7 percent. And you wonder why the hell the rest of the world is catching up and, in some places, it was moving ahead.
Well, America got a wakeup call with the pandemic. We didn't think much about supply chains. People wonder what the hell you talk about 5 years agotalking about supply chains. They know now.
Well, guess what? We know we can never again be so vulnerable.
One key component is semiconductorsthose little, tiny, small computer chips, smaller than the fingerprintfingertip, I should saythat affect nearly everything in our lives from cell phones, automobiles, refrigerators, the most sophisticated weapons systems the United States military has.
America invented these chips. But, over time, fromwe went from producing 40 percent of the world's chips to then producing less than 10 percent. But we're turning that around.
Now, the private sectorbecause I decided we're going to get this donethe private sector is investing a record $470 billion in advanced manufacturing right here in the United States foras well as clean energy in America, again, creating good-paying jobs, a prevailing wage, changing people's lives.
And fourth, we passed the Inflation Reduction Act. It gave Medicare the power to negotiate lower prescription drug prices[applause]just like the VA has been able to do.
You know, folks, the same drug company making the same prescription, if theyif you go to buy it in Paris, it's cheaper than the United States. Go to buy it in any major country in the world, it's cheaper than the United States. How in the hell can that happen?
Well, guess what? I and many others have been trying to get this done for decades, but by the time they triedthey tried and tried, but Big Pharma always was able to stop them.
Not this time. This time, we took on Big Pharma, and we won. Now, seniors on Medicare, instead of paying 400 bucks a month for insulin, they're paying $35 a month. It's life-changing.
And it's not just good for people who need lifesaving prescriptions, it's notit's good for the nation's budget as well. Guess what? The first round of cuts in prices that we've been able to negotiate saves the taxpayer $160 billion. Hear me? [Applause]
No, no, we're not spending money. We're saving money, because we don't have to pay out an additional $160 billion for the same drug coverage. That's pretty nice, I think. Doing more for people and costing taxpayers less money to do itthat's a good objective.
And this bill includes the biggest investment ever not only in America, but anywhere in the world when dealing with climate change: $369 billion. And the investment isn't only going to help us save the planet, it's going to create jobslots of jobs, tens of thousands of good-paying union jobs.
Now, let me tell you[applause]. Now, let me tell you what one of the core principles is throughout everything I've done: Make it in America. We're beginning to make things again with American workers, American products, manufacturing in American plants. For too long, we exported jobs for cheaper labor costs abroad and imported more expensive products that weren't of a quality we needed.
We're not going to do that anymore. Under my plan, under Bidenomics, we're creating jobs at home and exporting products abroad. Union jobs.
And here's the thing: We're doing all this by cutting the deficit. The budget agreement I just negotiated cuts the deficit by $1 trillion, and we didn't give up anything of consequence.
That's on top of my first 2 years asmy first 2 years as President, I've cut the deficit by more than any President has in American history: $1.7 trillion cut from the deficit while doing these things. And I've been able to cut the deficit while protecting all the critical investments I just talked about, as well as protecting Social Security and Medicare from being cut.
You may remember, when I did the State of the Union, they startedI said did any of these guys want to cut Social Security and Medicare. And they said, ""Liar, liar!"" And so I stopped. I hadn't planned on it. I stopped, and I said, ""Oh, how many of you want to cut Social Security?""
Audience member. No one!
The President. Andnono, I'm notno, I asked them. I asked the Republicans. [Applause] Nohere, listen to this. Remember, I said, ""How many of you want it cut?""
And all of the sudden, the ones calling me liars was completely silent. And I saidI said: ""The spotlight is on you all now. How many of you promise not to cut Social Security?"" And they all said, ""We won't cut it."" Guess what? It's not cut. I'd never negotiated at a State of the Union before.
Audience member. You called them out, Joe!
The President. Yes, that's a fact. [Laughter]
One thing didn't get done in that budget agreement was dealing with the Tax Code. I think we all know: Nobody, including those who would do very well, but aren't super, superwealthynobody thinks the Tax Code is fair.
No, I'm serious. It's just simply not fair. [Laughter] How could it be fair when 55 of the largest corporations in America paid zero in Federal income tax on $40 billion in profit?
Audience members. Boo!
The President. Nowell, guess what? We need to get rid of some of these ridiculous special interest tax loopholes, like the one for Big Oil. Big Oil made $200 billion in profit last year, and they got a $30 billion tax break on top of it.
Audience members. Boo!
The President. Some of the hedge fund managers and crypto tradersthese things are going to change, I promise you, if I have anything to do with it. And the ideawe used to have about 750 billionaires in America. Now, they tell me it's about a thousand, because of the last administration.
Well, guess what? You know whatyou know what percentage they pay in taxes? Eight percent. E-i-g-h-t.
Audience member. What do you pay, Joe?
The President. I pay a hell of a lot more than that, man. [Laughter] So do you.
And by the way, they pay at a lower tax rate than schoolteachers, than firefighters, probably anyone in this room.
Audience members. Joe! Joe! Joe!
The President. It's time they paid a minimum tax. I don't mind them being billionaires. Just pay your fair share, man.
The bottom line is this: It's time that big corporations and the very wealthy start paying their fair share. I made a promiseand I'll keep it for next 4 years if I'm electedthat no one making under $400,000 will see a penny of their Federal taxes go up. And they haven't. I kept that promise, and I will keep it.
But it's about time the superwealthy start paying their fair share. So in this timethis campaign, I'm going to go to the country and ask them if they giveif they agree with me, it's time for everyone to start paying their fair share.
Folks, look, let me close with this. I truly believe this country is about to take off. I really believe it. Notmy word. The investment we've made in these past 3 years have the power to transform this country in thefor the next five decades.
And guess who's going to be at the center of the transformation? You. You. Union. [Applause] Noworking people in this country.
In 10 years, America is going to look around and say: ""My God, look what we did. Look at the nation's roads, bridges, airports, at all theall the investments."" Andwho do you think they're going to give credit for? You, because you were the
Audience member. Yeah!
The President. No, because you were the ones that will have done it. You'reyou're going to lead the world in manufacturing of semiconductor chips. Who's going to build those fabs? Who's going to workwho's going to work in them? Union members are going to do that.
A huge[applause]. A huge number of jobs we're creating won't require a college degree, but they'll pay above $100,000 a year. Who's going to get these jobs? Working folks.
We're doing something right now no one has thought possible. We're on the edge of a manufacturing boom in America. For the longest time, we've been told to give up on American manufacturing. I was told you can't do it here anymore. Well, I never believed it. And this Nation used to lead the world in manufacturing, and we're going to do it again.
Audience member. Thanks, Joe! [Applause]
The President. No, I promise you.
People studying this right now are astonished at what's going on, a boom they never saw coming. Well, we're going to show them. Who do you think is going to get stamping these products ""Made in America""? You are. You are.
But the Republicans don't like this anymore. Most of them opposed everything I've done and most want to get rid of it all. So we've got a fight on our hands.
And my question to you is simple: Are you with me in this fight?
Let me tell you something
Audience members. Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe!
The President. Because let me tell you something: If Republicans come after what I've done, when they come back to try to get rid of all these clean energy investments and they try to stop the plan on infrastructure, when they try to do these things, guess what? They're coming for your jobs. They're coming for your jobs.
They're coming for your future. They're coming for the future we're building for your kids and your grandkids. And when they come back, as they did just this past week, with their trickle-down economic plan to cut taxes for the rich, who don't thinkwho do you think they're carrying the water for?
They're tryingthey've introduced a bill again to reinstate the $2 trillion tax cut of the80 percent of which goes to the top 1 percent.
Who do you think is going to start carrying the burden?
Audience member. We are.
The President. You are. No, you are. That's the God's truth. Working people in this country.
Look, we've got a better answer. It's time for everyoneI mean everyone, no matter how rich or powerful they areto start paying their fair share. You've carried the country on your back. You've carried long enough.
It's time for millionaires and billionaires and big corporations to pay their fair share. I can get that done, but I need you badly. So are you with me?
Look, I've been at this a long time. I've been at this a long time. I can honestly say I've never been more optimistic about America's future.
I know a lot of peopleit's hard to believe, but not for me, because I know the people of this country. We just have to remember who we are. We're the United States of America. There's nothingnothing, nothingbeyond our capacity. Nothing beyond our capacity when we do it together.
Audience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!
The President. God bless you all. May God protect our troops. Keep the faith.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2023-06-16 00:00:00,"Remarks at the National Safer Communities Summit in West Hartford, Connecticut","
The President. Hello, hello, hello.
Audience members. Hello!
The President. I think maybe your patience exceeds your good judgment. [Laughter] Please, have a seat, if you have one.
Thank you for your commitment. I really mean it.
You know, as a kid, I came out of a different movement, the civil rights movement. Senator Blumenthal and I have talked about it before. I come from a State that has the eighth largest Black population in the country and was segregated when I was a kid. That's what got me engaged. And it made me believe that we could do anything. Made me believe we could do anything.
So I want to thank Chris for the introduction.
But before I say anything else, I want to acknowledge the amazing young people we just heard from. You know[applause]I really mean it.
It takes extraordinary courage for them to stand up here and retell the story. Because many of you out thereeither parents, relatives, and/or victims yourselfit's not just your story, it's the first graders, the educators of Sandy Hook. It's the kids and teachers at Uvalde who I sat with afterwards. It's the EmanuelMother Emanuel, 8 years ago tomorrow. It's the Tree of Life Synagogue. It's the families all across Hartford.
Not just the shootings that make the headlines, but every single dayevery damn day in Americain thein areas that are poor, mostly minority, there's a mass shooting. And it never reaches the crescendo that it reaches other places. Every single day.
And, folks[applause]. Folks, there's athere's a lota lot we have to do. And it takes courage to tell the story that you've been through, because, you know, I spent a lot of time as President, and I spent 30-some timesvisitsmany more days in Afghanistan and Iraq. And I watch. You know, we have posttraumatic stress, they call it, for soldiers. What's the difference between the posttraumatic stress that a soldier meets in the hills of Afghanistan and a 4-yeara fourth-grade kid meets in a classroom when they have to duck and cover? No, I'm serious.
And you're here, many of you, and it brings it all back. Brings it all back for your families, your parents, your siblings. And it brings it back for the entire country. It ripples through the Nation.
I don't know how many times I met with people at events in the country who shake my hand and say: ""I'm worried. There's been another shooting not far from where I live. I'm scared to send my kid to school."" It's had a profound impact.
And some people in this room have turned your pain into purposeI suspect all of you haveyour loss into determination; and your angerjustifiable angerinto a deep-seated commitment. You're the reason why I'm so optimistic about the future of this country. And that's not hyperbole, that's a fact. You're the best educated, most involved, least selfish, and most consequential generation in American history.
I'm also optimistic because of leaders like Senator Murphy. Chris, thanks for inviting me today to organizeand for organizing this summit. You know, Chris and I have known each other a long time and grew closer after that December day in 2012. You just elected to the Senate, and Barack and I had just been reelected to the White House, when the soul of Newtown, the soul of Connecticut, the soul of the Nation was pierced forever.
You've never forgotten that feeling, and you've never given up on something that can neverwe can never loseever lose: hope. Hope.
The same goes for Senator Dick Blumenthal, a great friend. He was attorney general when my deceased son was attorney general of Delaware. Another leader in the fight against gun violence.
And Governor Lamont and Connecticut delegation, which is incredibleI think on this issue and many others, you're the best delegation in the United States of America. [Applause] No, Ithat's the truth.
I also want to acknowledge the gentlelady from Georgia, Lucy McBath. Lucy carries her son Jordan in her heart. She proves you can run for office on ending gun violence in the South and you can win. Only by about 20 points or something like that. I've never come close. [Laughter] Lucy, I know this isn't easy for you. You'veyou're a real pro. But I know it's not easy for you. I remember.
And one of Jill's favorite people in the whole world, and mineI always introduce her asshe isMark Kelly is her husband. [Laughter] Ladies and gentlemen, Gabby Giffords. She's a[applause]Gabby has more courage than most people I have ever known.
I had the honor to bestow the Presidential Medal of Freedom on Gabby, not only for her courage, but her intellect that helped carry this movement. She's not stopping now. She's not stopping now. Gabby, I love you. You're wonderful.
And, Congressman Larson, thanks for the passport into your district. You've never given up. You've never given up either.
And to the State and local leaders, the mayor, othersthe dedication to this vital issue is critical. It really is.
Look, you know, to the survivors and families, Jill and Iand Jillmy wife, Jill, is not here today with me. She is in Delaware right now. She had to go back up.
Jill and I have gotten to know many of you over the years. Some of us have become friends for a long time. We've kept in touch. Mark, it's good to see you again and your family.
And losses may be different circumstances, but we've shared before something that's helped our family. When my wife and daughter were killed when a tractor trailer struck them andjust after I got electedmy two boys weren't expected to live.
And then later, when my son Beau, who was the attorney general and spent a yearvolunteered to spend a year in Iraq, died of stage 4 glioblastoma, my daughter Ashley tappedtaped a mirrorexcuse mea message to the mirror. The way we get toeverything gets to me through my wife and daughter now is athey know I have to shave in the morning[laughter]so they'll tape on the mirrorfor realso I can see it when I'm shaving.
And one day, she left me a quote from Immanuel Kant, who wrote that finding happiness and peace of mind when it seems impossible can be done. He said, ""You need something to do, someone to love, and something to hope for.""
""Something to do"" was to fulfill the promise I made to my son Beau and to my familyand your families, and you've made toothat I would not retreat from public life in the sadness that I felt afterwards, that I'd stay engaged to solve problems. ""Someone to love""my family, my kids, my grandkids. And ""something to hope for""all of you, survivors and advocates, who have built real movement with something to hope for. Something to hope for.
That your collective trauma and injuries are not going to be in vain. That your friend, your family member, your loved one did not die in vain. That by acting in their memory, you can prevent the next tragedy, you can save life, you can save families. In the process, you can continue to save the country. And I mean that.
Look, folks, a year ago, the conventional wisdom was, we would never get any Republicans to support gun legislation, period. That was the conventional wisdom. And all the usual obstacles would block us once again. But it didn't happen.
Instead, I signed into law the Bipartisan Safer Community Act, which you've referenced several times today, which many have described was the most significant gun safety law in 30 years. And it is.
But for me, and for most of you, here's what it really is: It's an important first step. I know it feels like it isn't enough when you turn on the news and see another tragedy at a school, a grocery store, a parade, or a place in Americahonestly, I feel like that as well.
The facts give us reason to hope though. So far this year, murder is down in many major cities across the country. There's far too much gun violence, but that's why this summit is so important and why Chris asked me to be here today with the following message.
One year ago, we did come together. We did hear the call for too many families. Every one of those families I've met at all the places I've mentioned, I was there formet with every single family. And you know what they'd say? Almost the same phrase, Dick. They'd say, ""Do something."" ""Do something."" And the response usually was, ""My prayers are with you.""
Well, prayers are fine. They're important that it doesn't happen again. But it's not going to stop it. We have to take action. We have to move, have to do something.
And so what happened? We began to continue to fight again, because for a while there, there were only about two dozen of usin the Congress or as Vice President or when I wasas Presidentwho thought anything could be done.
We did pass the most meaningful gun safety law in 30 years. We did overcome an unrelenting opposition of the gun lobby to gun manufacturers and so many politicians who hide behind the belief that they'll never have to pay a price for their inaction when they oppose commonsense gun legislation. And we beat them. We beat them.
And we did it through a bipartisan effort that included a majority of responsible gun owners. Because whether you're Democrats or Republicans, we all want families to be safe. We all want to drop them off at the house of worship, a mall, a movie, the school door without worrying that's the last time we're ever going to see them.
We all want our kids to have the freedom to learn to read and to write instead of learning how to duck and cover in a classroom. And above all, we all agree: We are not finished. We are not finished. We are not finished.
Look, I know you've had a full day of summit, getting into details of the law. But, folks listening at home, here's a quick summary of what'swhat the law is doing. It's already allowing the Justice Department, through the FBI, to run enhanced background checks on young people under 21 trying to buy a firearm.
This legislation has already provided more than $230 million for States to expand the use of tools like the ""red flag"" lawsas my son was the first to enforce when he was attorney generalwhich says that a court has a right to temporarily movetemporarily remove a firearm where there's danger to themselves or others.
More people die from gun violence as a consequence of suicide than anything else that happens in the Nation. Suicide. This legislation has already delivered more than $1.5 billion to States and communities to make schools safer, improve access to mental health services, and help young people deal with the grief and trauma resulting from gun violence, posttraumatic stress syndrome.
It includes an additional 14,000 mental health professionals hired and trained to work at our schools.
The law helps prevent domestic abusers from purchasing guns. I'm the guy that wrote the Violence Against Women Act. I proposed a long time ago[applause]I didn't mean toI didn't say it for that reason. But I care deeply about it, because the ultimate abuse: the abuse of power. My dad used to say, ""The single worst abuse of all was the abuse of power.""
We fought like hell to close the so-called ""boyfriend loophole."" If in fact you had a stay-away order issued against a man or a woman because of your boyfriend or girlfriend and they weren't your spouse, then guess what? They decidedthe last administration decided not to impose this limitation on being able to own a weapon.
So we finally can say that those convicted of domestic violence abuse against their girlfriend or boyfriend cannot buy a firearm, period. And by the way, it's already saving lives. There are fewer deaths occurring in that area.
For the first time ever, we explicitly made gun trafficking a Federal crime. They say: ""What the hell? It wasn't already?"" [Laughter] No, I'm serious. Think about it.
You go home and tell your mother, father, brother, sister, aunt, and uncle that, ""Whoa, gun trafficking is now a crime."" They're going to look at you like: ""What are you talking about? It's always been a crime."" It wasn't a crime.
We did the same thing for straw purchases. That's when a middleman, who can pass the background check, buys a gun usually for someone who can't pass the background check. It's now a Federal crime if you do that.
And finallywe finally clarified who needs to register as a Federal licensed gun dealer, because a federally licensed gun dealer is required by law to run background checks on those he's selling the weapon to. And in most citiesdown in Philadelphia and New York, areas I know welllike up hereyou'd see a truck pull up, pull to the curb, and selling weaponsselling guns, selling AR-15. Selling weapons. Well, guess what? You do that now, you go to jail.
There's so much more, but the bottom line: If this law had been in place a year ago, lives would have been saved. And it's in place now, and it is saving lives today. We got it done because of you. Not a joke.
You all think we're being nice to you. It's[laughter]. You're tough. [Laughter] Thank God. But Ibut I really mean it. It's because of you. Moms Demand Action. Big deal. All theall the[applause]. No, I really mean it.
Because what did you do when young people are coming out, people who you grew up with who didn't think this was real; the suburbanite Republican man or womanor Democrat, not just Republicanin thewho thinks, well, you know, everything is fine, and then all of a sudden they see someone of your caliber, someone of your commitment, walking down the street saying, ""We've got to do something."" It matters. It matters, it matters, it matters. And you can feel it; you can taste it, what you're doing.
And here's the deal: You're changing the culture, proving we can do more than just thoughts and prayers. You're changing our politics. You're registering voters, you're recruiting candidates, you're getting them elected. You've proven that you're powerful and you're relentless. And it matters. It matters. They know you're not going away.
As I just said when I signed the law: a call to action to do more. Because I don't see that this was enough; neither do you. Really important. Really, if nothing else happened, we have changed things for the better.
So I set out to take as much executive actionthat's a fancy word of saying: What can I do as President on my own? [Laughter] Executive action that made it illegal to manufacture so-called ""ghost guns."" I just signed that, and I said that.
It's being challenged in court, but so far, it matters. That allow anyone to assemble a gun at home, bought from several different places, in as little as 30 minutes. Come on. These weapons don't have serial numbers. That's why they like to buy them, so criminals can use them to commit crimes and not leave behind a registration of who owned the weapon.
It made it harder for people to buy stabilized braces. Put a pistol on a brace, and it makesturns into a gun. Makes them where you can have a higher caliber weapona higher caliber bullet coming out of that gun. It's essentially turning it into a short-barreled rifle, which has been a weapon of choice by a number of mass shooters.
We're making it easier to buy gun locks and other safe storage at gun stores.
If any one of you drove over the parking lot here today, got out of your car, and left a key in your car, and a kid comes along who's 13, 14 years old, gets in your car, takes it on a joyride and kills someone, guess what: You're liable.
Why should that not be the case if you don't lock up your weapon? Why should that not be the case? Why is that not required? And most gun owners agree with me.
We also established a zero-tolerance policy for rogue gun dealers who willfully violate the law. Now, instead of a slap on the wrist, their licenses are revoked.
You have a lot of gun dealers who are engaged in shady actions. Well, guess what? Used to be, they getthey'd get a fine. Now they lose their license to sell. We established a strike force to crack down on gun trafficking across State lines, including guns brought up from Georgia, South Carolina, Washington, Philadelphia, New York, right here to Hartford.
All told, we've taken more executive action to reduce gun violence than any of my predecessorsprobably than all my predecessors. They're being challenged in court, but so far, so good. [Laughter]
And the budget I submitted to Congress would help reduce crime by increasing funding to go after gun traffickers. And for theby the wayyou know what I get when Iwe're talking about the fentanyl at the border and all that? I speak with the President of Mexico. ""Will you stop sending guns to us?"" We are sending dangerous weapons, particularly assault weapons, to Mexico. To Mexico. They're asking us: ""Please stop it. Cut it off at the border.""
What in God's name are we becoming if we don't do this?
Look, ladies and gentlemen, for those who say they're concerned about crime, you can't deal with crime without dealing with gun violence. It's a simple proposition.
Remember, for a long time in America, car accidents were the leading killer of children. This was mentioned earlier. Then, in 2020, guns became the number-one killer of children in America. Guns. More than car accidents, more than cancer. Let me say that again: We can't let that just become another statistic. Guns, the number-one killer of children in the United States of America?
Folks, it's time once again that we banned AR-15 rifle-style weapons, high-capacity magazines; they're not only a weapon of war, they're the single biggest driver of profits for the gun industry. That's why they're selling them. Profit, profit, profit. The single biggest.
As I said, we did it once before, in '94, and 10 years after that, the ban wasmass shootings went down significantlythe number of mass shootings. That'swhen the ban expired, mass shootings tripled. But let the ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines come back into vogue.
Look, I find it outrageous that of all the industries in Americaand by the way, I've been doing this a long time. [Laughter] I know I don't look that old. I know. [Laughter] I'm a little under 103. [Laughter]
But all kidding aside, I thoughtI mean, I'm going to say something outrageous. I was a pretty powerful Senator. Iprettymanaged some of the biggest committees: judiciary, foreign policy, et cetera. But I didn't know 10 years agoI didn't know that there aregun manufacturers are immune from liability. I didn't know that. Gun manufacturers.
Just imagine how many more people would be dead if the tobacco industryif the tobacco industry was immune from liability, you couldn't sue the tobacco industry. I'm being deadly earnest. Think about the number of people who would be dead today that are alive because we could sue them and they paid billions of dollars for theirfor the damage they were doing.
Well, ladies, we need to end immunity for the gun manufacturers. We've got to hold them accountable. And it's time we establish universal background checks and require safe storage of firearms.
And just remember, the United States of America has the finest fighting force in the history of the world. We provide ourthese same servicemembers with the most lethal weapons on Earth. But we also require them to receive significant training before they are allowed to use them.
We require extensive background checks and mental health assessment on them before they can allow to use them. We require them to lock them up and store the weapons responsibly or they're court-martialed and put in jug.
These are commonsense requirements all gun owners should follow. Every gun owner should be required to have the same requirements held to him or her. We know what to do.
Congress needs to act. And let me be clear about something: If this Congress refuses to act, we need a new Congress.
And we need States to act as well. Not everynot every State has a Governor as competent as Governor Lamont, and I mean that. But they can do a lot more. Look what the Gov has done here in this State.
Less than 2 weeks ago here in Connecticut, Governor Lamont signed a bipartisan legislation with more than a dozen measures to improve gun safety, from providing open carry and strengtheningfrom prohibiting open carry and strengthening the ban on assault weapons and ghost guns.
Illinois, Washington State passed assault weapons bans this year, bringing the total to 10 States and the District of Columbia. Michigan, Minnesota, Colorado, Vermont passed legislation establishing or strengthening the ""red flag"" laws. Now, 21 States plus the District of Columbia have ""red flag"" laws in effect. Since 2021, seven States have passed an increase in accountability for gunfor the gun industry.
I said, beginningat the beginning, youthey've turned their pain into purpose. You turned your cause into reality.
I believe we've reached a tipping point in this Nation. I really do. Swear to God. People in this room are the big reason why we reached that tipping point. As Senator Murphy says, ""Success begets success."" But the converse is also true: Failure begets failure. That's why Jill and I, Kamala, and the entire administration are more determined than ever that you should be successful as well.
Look, let me close with this. I know many people here who have been impacted by gun violence, lost someone they loved, fought so hard for so many years. A lot of you are tired.
Audience member. Yes, sir! [Inaudible]
The President. You're tired. No, II
Audience member. Yes, sir!
The President. I get it. Try being 110 and doing it again. [Laughter]
All kidding aside, a lot of people are frustrated. My mother, God love herall 5-foot-1Catherine Eugenia Finneganshe'd look at me and say: ""Joey, never bow. Never bend. Never yield. Never kneel."" We never will on this issue. Never, never, never, never, never. [Applause]. Until we have a rational policy.
Folks, are we ever going to make progress we need to make? I'm here to tell you we cannot give up. We will not get thereI still remember the people I met with in Newtown, in Orlando, in Las Vegas, in Pittsburgh, in Charleston, Parkland, El Paso, Uvalde, Buffalo, Monterey Park, and so many other places that never make the headlines.
I've never forgotten them, and I never will forget them. And I'll never stop fighting for them. I promise you. And I believe this is true: that everyone in this room, you'll never stop fighting for them as well.
We will ban assault weapons in this country. We will ban multiround magazines. We will hold gunmakers liable. We will beat the gun industry. We will beat big money that sits behind them and the politicians who refuse to stand up and act.
It won't be easy. I have no illusions how fiercely they'll fight back, but I also have no illusions about the people in this room.
Look at what you've already done here in Connecticut and around the country. Look at the movement you've built. Look at the people you've helped elect. Look at the progress you've made in statehouses. Look at all the mothers organizing all across the country.
Listen to the young people who've spoken out here today. They're speaking for a whole generation, and they will not be ignored. They will not be shunned. They will not be silent in this moment.
In this moment, we have to remember whatI got to know himNelson Mandelawhen I tried to get to Africato South Africa to meet him. And he came back, and he met me when he was finally freed. He met me at the White House. And he looked at me, and I swear to Godit wasn't unique to me, I'm surehe said, ""It always seems impossible until it gets done.""
There's nothing beyond our capacity. That's the power of memory of your loved one. That's the power of this movement. That's the power of America. Our lives and the lives of our Nation find purpose: something to do, someone to love, something to hope for. We have just to keep going and keep the faith.
Every time I'd walk out of my Grandpop Finnegan's house up in Scranton, he'd yell, ""Joey, keep the faith."" My grandmother would yell, ""No, Joey, spread it.""
Remember who we are. We're the United States of America. And there's nothing beyond our capacity when we do it together.
God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.
We can get this done. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I mean it. Thank you.
Now, as yousome of you know, I'd usually come down and say hi to all of you. They tell me there's a storm coming in. Is that right? It's stillis that still the deal?
Audience members. Nooo!
The President. If that's the truth, now, don't make a lie[laughter]. As thatas that scene in the John Wayne movie, ""Don't make me a dog-faced, lying pony soldier."" [Laughter]
All right, well, I tell you what, here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to ask the White House photographer to come up. And what I'm going to do is, I'm going to standI can'tI usually shake everybody's hand. But I'm going to stand in front of each section. No, I really mean it. And thenand if you can see the camera, they can see you. And it's the least consequential part of this whole meeting for you, I promise.
All right? God save the Queen, man.

2023-06-16 00:00:00,"Remarks at a Campaign Fundraiser in Greenwich, Connecticut","
The President. Please, have a seat. First of all, Stephen, sir, thank you very, very much for the hospitality. Just what you all need to do in early June, with graduations going on: show up, have to get dressed on a Friday, then maybe even Saturday. Who knows. [Laughter] Anywayand I want to thank all my colleagues from the Senate and the House, and the Governor.
I think you haveand I mean this sincerelyI think you have the most consequential delegation in the United States Congress. I really mean it. And you've got a Governor who is really first rate. They know it, and they know what they do. They know how to get things done. And they've been great, great allies.
And, folks, everyone herewe wouldn't beI wouldn't be here, standing here as President of the United States, without a lot of you in this room. You'veI never raised a lot of money when I was running before, whether I was Vice President or whether I was a Senator oryou know, I wasI did all right.
But this last time out, many of youI raised more money than I think anybody has ever raised in small contributions as wellI mean, literally millions of dollars. And it allowed me to be able to say what I thought, do what I thought was the right thing to do, and be straightforward about it.
So thank you. It makes a gigantic difference.
[At this point, the President checked the hand-held microphone.]
Is this thing working or should I put it down?
Audience member. It's working.
The President. It's working.
Well, look, so far, so good, in terms of thejust a few facts and then maybe we can just mingle, and you can ask me whatever you want, talk about anything you want to talk about.
You know, I've met with a lot of world leaders. My background going into this job, I guess, was mostly constitutional issues and foreign policy. And I've met the vast majority of the heads of state in the past. And when I was Vice President, that was my job. When I was Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman, it's what I spent most of my time doing.
And there were two objectives I had. You may recall when I announced for President last timewhen you were helping me, many of youI indicated that I thought there were three things that had to be done.
One, we had to restore the soul of this Nationthe sense of decency, honor; some sense of constitutional, institutional structureagain. We had sort ofwe had, I think, devolved to a point where we hadn't been in a long, long, long time.
And soand I said, ""So I want to restore the soul of the country, number one."" Number two, I wanted to build the economy from the middle up, the bottom up. Because when that happens, the wealthy do very well and everybody has a shot. And in the trickle-down economy, not a lot trickled down to my pop'smy dad's kitchen table. Butand, number three, I said I wantedand I got legitimately and understandably criticizedI said I wanted to unite the country. Because in a democracy, we can't function if we can't unite. We need consensus in order to run this great country by the very nature of our institutions and our structure.
And so that's what we set out to do. With your help, we'veI think we've gotten a lot of it done.
For example, with regard to restoring the sense of decency and honor, people areit's notnot gottenit's not as vitriolicwith notable exceptionsas it has been. I think things are moving a little. I think people thought when wewhen we took on the very hard-right members of the House of Representatives dealing with the debt ceiling, I think people were surprisedsurprised that we were able to pull together enough people on both sides to come up with a rational and a serious budget proposal.
My first 2 years, I reduced the debtmy administration reduced thethe debt by $1.7 trillionmore than any President has in American historyin the first 2 years. We've created over 13 million 400 thousandI think it's 13-450 million jobsmore than any President has in the first 4 years of any administration. And it's not aboutit's about giving people a shotgiving people an even shot.
We also put ourselves in a position where we have done more on the environment, I think, thanI think it's fair to saythan any President ever has. And the reason I say that is because we're in a situation where, if you'reI'magain, I was warned not to make a20-minute speech here, so I'm not going to do that. But I want to just give you a few, as they used to say, factoids.
Number one, we were able to pass and maintainkeep in play, no matter what the other team tried to take away$369 billion in environmental money for the environment.
Of that, we've reduced by the year 2030, we're going to reduce 50 to 52 percent of all emissionsall emissions. We're in a situation where thewe're in a situation where we're going to move in a direction that, by 2030, we're going to have 75 percent of all the energy we produce renewable energy. By the year thirty2035, the United States is on path to do 100-percent renewable energy.
We'reconservationwe've conserved more land and water than any administration has in American history. We've conserved the mostfor example, in Alaska alone, we've been able to preserve and make sure the 9excuse me, 9 million acres. In Minnesota, the Boundary Waters, 250 millionthousand acres.
Theyou knowanyway, I won't go through it all, but we've done a great deal. Wefor example, one of the things I tried very hard to doand everybody was saying we couldn't do anything in a bipartisan wayis not just the partisan side, but the traditionalhow can Inot enemies, but adversaries.
Onea lot of people thought in the very beginning, when I didn't announce my green plan, that somehow I was backing off of what I had said before. Well, what I was doing was meeting with the auto industry and the autoworkers and the laborers to convince them that it's overwhelmingly in their interest to support these environmental changes.
Well, to make a quick analogypoint, thistomorrow, I'm going up to Philadelphia to have every major labor union in the country endorse meevery one. And yesterday every major environmental group endorsed meevery single one.
Because we figured out it's in the mutual interest. The jobs lie in the future. The jobsnot on all thethat doesn't mean we're not going to need some oil and gas andfor a while. But it does mean that we're going tomake a fundamental shift.
Andfor example, when I go to these COP meetingsthesethese meetings relating to international efforts to deal with the environment worldwide, whether it was in Cairo or thewherever it is. And guess what? We're now on a path that we're going to be able to take outwe got agreement last time out with all the major countriesover 100 countriesthat they will deal with whatthey're referred to as those really terribleterrible, terriblehow can I say it?just everything from methane to all the worst of all chemicals going into the air.
Well, you know, we've got aI proposed at one of those meetings with thethe sixthere are seven major nations in the world economiesthat we all agree to get rid of methane by the year 20well, we're moving that way. Methane is four, five, six times more damaging to the environment than, for example, just greenhouse gases. And we talk about it all the time.
We areyou know, we're in a position where we have 50 factories now in America making electric batteries and increasing the production. We're not where China is now, but we're making significant progress.
We havewe're going to have twice as many charging stations as when I began. And by the yearby the time we finish the transition to electric vehicles, we're building 500 thousand500,000 charging stations nationwide so you can go across the country like you couldevery gas station you needed was available to you. Well, same thing here.
And one of the things that I thinkand I'm going to end hereis that I've tried to bring together traditional adversaries because I think the world has changed.
There's a famous poet namedand I was quoting Irish poets, and my colleagues would always kid me because they say I'm doing it because I'm Irish. That's not the reason. I do it because they're the best poets in the world. [Laughter]
But Seamus Heaney, who'sI mean, he's passed away, but I'm friends with his wifehe wrote a poem called ""The Cure of Troy."" And there was a sentence, and he says, ""All is changed""""All is changed, changed utterly. A terrible beauty has been born.""
Well, a terrible beauty has been born. We have an opportunity to make significant progress off of it. The idea that finallyI don't hearif I were here in this living room with your friends 3 years ago, you would have had a lot of friends who would say they doubted whether there was a real environmental crisis, that there really was a serious problem.
Do you know many people saying that these days? They may say ""In my interest, I don't want to do that."" But do you know anybody who says there's not an environmental crisis?
There was an article in the New York Times three Mondays, ago; there was one again, I think, 4 days agopointing out where the State of TexasState of Texas has more solar and wind energy. I think it's 70 percent of all their energy produced by solar and wind because it is significantly cheaper. Cheaper. Cheaper. Not just because it isit is environmentally moremore friendly, but it's cheaper.
And guess what they're doing? The legislature is trying to get rid of it because they want to do the bidding of the oil companies. We're going to need oil for a while. We're going to need gas. We're going tobut nothing like we consume now. Nothing.
But it's working, and that's bothered some people that it's working.
But the other point I want to make is that it's the same way in bringing together the world. And I'll end with this.
I get both credit and blame for keeping NATO united. The fact is that when Iwe supported Ukraine, and all my colleagues in here did as well. We supported Ukraine. The concern was because wePutin was certainand I've known him for 28 years, almost 30 years, only having met with himlast time I met with him for any period of time was 2 years ago in Geneva. But I know him.
And he was confidentconfidentthat he could break the West; we would not stay together because NATO had never beenhadwas having some serious rifts internally about what to do in Europe. Well, guess what? Ask any NATO leader. NATO is more united today than it has been any time in the history of NATOin the history of NATO. That's good for America.
And by the way, when I went and told people that we'reI was going to bring Japan alongwhen's the last time Japan would have an interest in seeing what peace in Europe and supply[laughter]no, I'm serious. Think about it. Well, guess what? Became close friendI used to always kid Barack, as the Governor knows. And we'dI met with him every morning at 9 o'clock for 8 years when I was Vice President. And I'd start off and sayhe'd start talking, and I would say, ""All politics is personal, Barack.""
It's personal with heads of state. It's personal withwith dealing with colleagues. It's personal. And you have to build trust.
Well, now you haveyou have Japan significantly increasing their defense budget; Japan supporting Ukraine in Europe because he knows that there's no such thing as a major war in Europe that will not affect all the world.
You have him finally makingwhich no one believed, but when I talked to him at length about why he had to get together with South Korea and settle a 50-year difference they had about womenthe way they were treating womenwell, they've worked it out. They're now dealing with one another.
The point is that these moments of change, I think we have opportunities to not only change the direction but to change the order of things in ways that are better for the moment.
I'll end with this. Thehow can I say? Before I decided to run in 2020and I had decided not to run initially, until we saw what happened down in Charlottesville, Virginia. And that young woman was killed. And the former President was asked, ""What do you think?"" Said there were good people on both sides.
Well, you know, not figuratively, literally, my grandchildren asked for mewe have a tradition in my family, for realit's only been exercised about 10 times since I've been alivewhere any child can ask for a family meeting. And it's taken seriously. Not a joke. And you can have a family meeting to discuss what'sand if the family wants, they[inaudible].
And so I got a call from my daughterwas in her last year at Columbia Law Schoolmy granddaughter. And I got a call from my number two granddaughter, who was a senior at Penn at that time. And then I had one who was a junior. Anyway. I have four granddaughters and a grandson.
And they all came to me. That wasgot the call on Thursday; we met on Saturday. And they saidbecause they knew I was thinking of running, but I knew it was going to be an ugly campaign. And I didn'twonder whether I wanted to put the family through that again.
And they said, ""Pop""they started at age; the oldest one spoke first. And now we said, ""Pop""named after my deceased daughterI saidsaid: ""Pop, you know Dad wants you to run. Will youyou've got to run. You've got to do it."" And they all went down their reasons.
And I got to my grandson. My wife doesn't like me telling this part, but I think it's important. My little grandson, who was then a sophomorein eighth grade, almost going into ninth, and he took outhe said, ""We know it's going to be tough, Pop.""
And the reasonyou know, I mean, think about it: Their entire life, their grandfather is either Senator, Vice President and/orwell, Senator at that time or Vice President, and their dad had been attorney general. And so their whole life, theythey understood the politics, just like if you'reInever knew what the hell a mortgage was. If my dad were a banker, I would have known was a mortgage was when I was 9 years old. [Laughter]
So he took out his cell phone. He said, ""We know it's going to be ugly, Pop."" And there was a photograph online. There was a picture that was online put out by someonewho did it, I didn't even lookof me walking out of the church with a military cord on, carrying my dead son with the American flag on it and my hand on the flag, and then my hand on my little grandson around his chin. And the headlinethe chyron at the bottom said, ""Biden molests another child."" Said, ""We know it's going to be ugly, Pop.""
Well, the truth is, I think the American people are a lot better than we give them credit for. I think they're focusing. I think they're looking hard. I think they're deciding what they have to do.
And I think that's going to crossacross the board. We hear these numbers about so many people are not going to move. I think people areare looking for it. I think they sense there's real opportunity. But they don't know exactly what it is yet.
And that's my responsibility. Everything we passedwe've done polling on since it's passedit's overwhelmingly popular. It's overwhelmingly. The CHIPS and Science Act, which created literally $300 billion in direct investment, creating tens of thousands of jobs.
We're in a situation where there's a trillion two hundred billion dollars inmoney for new environmental, notexcuse me, not just environment, inindustrial capacity. How canhow can you be the most powerful and successful nation in the world with a second rate infrastructure?
We used to be number 1 in the world; we're now number 14 in the world. There's thingsand this creates jobs, and it changes the environment and changes people's attitudes.
And so there's a lot we've done. And I think we just got to let many people know we've done it and be straight with people. Just be as straight as we can about what we've done and what we haven't done.
And one of the things I decided to do wasthis time out, when I ran last timewas to say what I thought was on my mind, because there wasn't anything worth anymore tojust to keep the job.
No, II mean, it sincerely. There's nothing noble about it. I've just been doing this so damn long, I'm not going to[laughter]but for real.
And I think that's how your delegation is, by the way. I think when push comes to shove, they'd rather sayrather than move on something they don't believe, to say ""no"" and take the risk of losing. Because I think we underestimate that people reward political courage. They reward courage.
And so I think that one ofyou know, and we have four or five major issues in this campaign, from what's happening to freedom, women's right to choose, what we're doing in freedom in education, freedomI mean, did you ever think you'd go through a time when the number-two contender on another team was banning books?
I mean, you knowanyway. I'm talking too much now. [Laughter]
So, anyway, I can't tell you how much I appreciate your help. Any questions you have for me, anything you want to talk about, I'm happy to do it. I'll give it to you straight.
Andbut I really am optimistic about America's prospects, not because of me, and I mean that sincerely, but because we have a new generation of young peopleyoung people who are the best educated, the most decent, the most engaged, the most involved generation in American history. That's why I'm optimistic, for real.
And think of the periods of time and these inflection points where the decisions made in a 4-, 5-, 6-, 7-year period set theset the stage for what the next four or five decades are going to look like.
Well, the post-war period is over. We're in a different world. And we have gigantic opportunities, and we just have to have the courage and remember: This is the United States of America. There is nothing, nothing, nothing beyond our capacity when we decide to work together. I mean it. I believe that with every fiber of my being.
I can't think of a single thing we've ever set our mind to do as a nation that we haven't been able to accomplish eventually.
So there's a lot I'm hopeful for that 2-year-old. I'm hopeful for that 2-year-old, that long before they're 30. Okay? And I'm 34 years old. [Laughter]
Anyway, I'm going to hush up. Thank you for listening, and I'm happy to talk.

2023-06-15 00:00:00,Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Travel and Entertainment Industry Executives on Efforts To Protect Consumers From Junk Fees and an Exchange With Reporters,"
West Coast Ports Labor Agreement 
The President. Before I begin, I want to thank everyone involved in reaching a tentative agreement at our ports on the West Coast. This deal shows collective bargaining works.
When employers and workers come together to agree on a deal that works for both of them, it's good for the economy and keeping our supply chain open.
A special thanks to Acting Secretary of Labor Julie Su, who used toher deep experience and judgment to keep parties talking throughout the negotiations. And this is going to have a real positive impact on trade.
She willshe's shown she's a true leader, and I think she should be confirmed. She's upI think she's up in the Senate today for a hearingher confirmation hearing.
And I want to thank both sides for staying at the table and reaching a deal. And a special thanks to the longshore workers who worked historically through this pandemic, and it was really heroically as well. And we finally getthey're going to get the pay and the benefits and the quality they deserve.
Consumer Protections Against Junk Fees 
Now, to the purpose of our meeting today. In my State of the Union Address, I outlined our fight against junk feesto end junk fees: these hidden charges that companies sneak into your bill to make you pay more and without you really knowing it initially.
Junk fees are not a matter for the wealthy very much, but they're a matter for working folks, like the homes I grew up in. And they can add hundreds of dollars a month and make it harder for families to pay their bills. I think it's just wrong.
My administration has also taken a number of steps to crack down on junk fees by reducing overdrafts by $5.5 billion a year and bounced checks cost by another $2 billion a year. That's real money.
And we're seeking to require airlines to refund money and give you additional compensation, like cash or travel vouchers, if your flight is canceled or delayed. These actions matter, and it's inspiring companies to change their practices.
Today I'm pleased to announce there's even more progress. One of the major categories of junk fees are ones that companies charge right at the end of the purchasing process, after you've already spent the time comparing your options. The solution isthe solution is what is called ""all-in pricing."" And that's where companies fully disclose their fees upfront when you start shopping so you're not surprised at the end when you check out.
The companies represented here today are voluntarily committing to all-in, upfront pricing. Some of them have used this process for years to sell ticketseventslike ticktockTickPickexcuse meDICE, and Newport Festival Foundation. Tens of millions of fans have already benefited from their decision.
Others, like Airbnb, have started giving customers the option of seeing all-in prices since we called for action last year, and other businesses are committing today. Starting in September, Live Nation will automatically list all the prices upfront for all tickets to events at more than 200 venues of its own, benefiting over 30 million customers. And it will give customers the option of an all-in price for all other tickets sold on its platform.
The ticket seller, SeatGreek [SeatGeek; White House correction], is also set to give customers the option of seeing all-in, upfront prices. And I'm pleased we're also joined by x-payxBk, a small venue in Des Moines, Iowa, that's going be using all upfront pricing for its hundred events ata year as well.
Folks, we're just at the latest private-sectorwethese are just the latest private-sector leaders who are responding to my call for action. And I'm asking their competitors to follow suit and adopt an all-in, upfront pricing as well.
This isthis a win for consumers, in my view, and proof that our crackdown on junk fees has real momentum. But there's more to do to address the problem of online ticketing to protecttoexcuse meto address the problems in the online ticketing industry and to get [rid of; White House correction] junk fees across all industries.
I want to thank Members of Congress who are working on legislation to address these junk fees in ticketing, lodging, and other industries.
This is real transparency, which leads to more competition, brings down costs for working Americans, keeps growing our economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down.
And I'm going to now turn it over to Lael, our Director of my National Economic Council, to start our discussion.
So thank you.
Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken's Travel to China 
Q. Mr. President, can you tell us what you want Blinken to achieve in China, sir? What would you like Blinken to achieve in China, sir?
The President. Yes, I've spoken with him. Andbut we'll talk about that later. That's not what this is about.
Cyber Attack Against Federal Agencies 
Q. And on the cyber attack today, sir? Can you say anything about the cyber attack today for us?
The President. No.
House Republican Investigation of the President 
Q. President Biden, why is[inaudible]""Big Guy""? Why did the Ukraine and FBI informant file refer to you as the ""Big Guy,"" President Biden? Why is that term continuously applied?
The President. Why do you ask such a dumb question?

2023-06-15 00:00:00,"Remarks at a White House Screening of ""Flamin' Hot""","
The First Lady. Hello. Thank you. And welcome to the White House.
It's wonderful to see so many friends here today. And can we get another round of applause for Mariachi VagasVargas.
The President. Where are they? [Laughter]
The First Lady. This country is and has always been defined by ""We, the People."" With varied backgrounds and beliefs, each of us makes our Nation and remakes it in big ways and small ones: when we create and innovate, when we raise families and start businesses, when we run for office or show up to volunteer.
We are millions of individuals who add up to something so much bigger than any one of us. And all of us deserve to have our stories told, respected, and heard.
Richard helped change the way companies think about Latino customers, helped establish that this community and the economic power it holds deserve to be taken seriously.
But this film isn't just about Richard. It's about everyone who has been overlooked and underestimated, but reached for a dream anyway. It's about sacrifice and love and partnershiphow when someone sees the possibility that you hold, you can find the courage to take risks and rise to the top, no matter what stands in your way.
And it's about the entire community who came together to make this movie possible. Of course, that effort has been led by the incomparable Eva Longoria.
Eva, as an actress, a producer, director, nonprofit founder, and entrepreneur, you have worked tirelessly to tell the stories of your community. And you've done so much to lift up the women, especially Latinas, who want to follow in your footsteps starting businesses and shaping politics and changing our world. We're honored to screen your movie here today.
When we fight for what we believe in, when we embrace what makes us unique, what makes us stand out, the world becomes a more beautiful place to be. And as you lead and as you fight for what you believe in, remember that Joe and I stand with you.
Now it's my pleasure to welcome Eva to the mike. Eva!
Actor, producer, and director Eva Longoria. So amazing. Oh my gosh! Woo! Thank you, guys. Thank you, Dr. Biden. Woo, we're at the White House!
Iwhen we set out to make this movie, I never imagined a night like this would be possible. It's a dream I didn't even know I had. So thank you to the Bidens for making this come true forfor not only me, for our entire cast that's here; for Latinos everywhere who deserve to have their stories told.
And I'm so happy that I'm here with y'all tonight at the people's house because this truly is a people's story. When our producer, DeVon Franklin, came to me with Richard's story, I was so inspired. And I was also ashamed that I didn't know his story. I'm Mexican American. He's Mexican American. How come we don't hear about the heroes in our community?
And I became obsessed with being the only person who could tell his story. I was inspired. And I thought: I am Richard Montaez. I've been told no. I've been told, ""Ideas don't come from people like you."" ""You're a woman. Maybe you shouldn't do that job.""
And Richard dared to ask: ""But why not me? Why can't I be great?"" So
The President. You are great.
Ms. Longoria. [Laughter] So, as you may heardhave heard already, Richard Montaez disrupted the food industry in the nineties by channeling his Mexican American heritage to help turn Flamin' Hot Cheetos into a multibillion-dollar brand today and a cultural phenomenon.
We are telling a story that celebrates the American entrepreneurial dream without sidestepping the fact that the dream isn't available in the same way for everyone.
We know that even though talent is evenly distributed in this world, opportunities have not been, which is why we rarely get to see movies where we are the heroes, let alone a janitor turned corporate executive.
So I knew I wanted to highlight his story, his life, and the importance and power of the Latino community within American culture. So we worked hard to produce this authentic film steeped in inclusion both in front of and behind the camera.
We have a brilliant Chicano Mexicano cast, with our lead actorsled by our lead actors Jesse Garcia and Annie Gonzalez, Bobby Soto, Brice Gonzalez, Emilio Rivera, Jimmy Gonzales. We have so many amazing talents in this movie, and also with our brilliant writer, Linda Yvette Chvez.
And we proved that when we tell our stories, we tell great American stories, because American history is Latino history; Latino history is American history.
So now we get to bring this story to La Casa Blanca under an administration that believes in our community and shares our values. And that's very, very important.
We have a lot of work to do, you guys. There's a lot of work coming, and we have to make sure that entrepreneurs and visionaries like Richard have the opportunities and that infrastructure of opportunity to make their dreams a reality. And that can only happen when you have leaders like President Biden.
So throughout Biden's careerI've been working with President Biden for many, many years, and it has always been a great joy; we share so muchhe's been a champion for working people in search of the American Dream. You know, what he's been doing for the country means there's going to be a lot more Richard Montaezes ready and waiting to take their shot to make history.
So it is my honor and sincere pleasure to introduce to you tonight the man who has been fighting for us all: fighting for Latinos, fighting for Americans, fighting for workers, and, most importantly, fighting for democracy. A man who understands and embodies the values of family, community, and perseverance.
Please help me welcome President Biden.
The President. My name is Joe Biden. I'm Jill Biden's husband.
Thank you, Eva, for that introduction. And congratulations on your debut
Audience member. We love you!
The President. I accept. [Laughter]
your debut as a director, adding another accomplishment to an already incredible, incredible career. We've known each other a long time. She was 17; I was 40. That's a[laughter].
And thank youthe entire cast and crew and everyone involvedfor making this film. It reminds us of the powerand I mean this sincerelythe power of diversity, hope, and opportunity, which is the American storyAmerican storythe story I see in all of you: Members of Congress that are here, members of my Cabinet that are here, my fellow Americans all across the country.
As Jill said, it's important to show the country all our storiesall our stories. That's why we're honored to host you, the first-ever public screening of a film focused on the Hispanic community at the White House, the people's houseyour house.
Jill and Eva described the film. Let me add this: When I think about tonight's movie, I think about courage. So many of you, your ancestors left behind all that they knew to start a new life in the United States, a nationa nationthat's more than just a place.
We're unique in all of history, America. America is not based on ethnicity or religion orwe're founded on an idea. For real. That's what makes itan idea: We hold these truths to be self-evident, all men and women are created equal, endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights[applause]no, I'mwe've never fully lived up to it. We've never lived up to it, but we've never abandoned it. And we keep trying to make it better.
You know, since our founding, the very idea of America has nurtured, enriched, and advanced by the contributions and the sacrifice and dreams of immigrants and all their descendants.
Like so many of you, like my family and Jill's from Ireland and from Italy, we look and see American families all acrossand most of us came because we were persecuted. Most of us came because we weren't welcome where we were. And when we got here, we had to fight like hell to be recognizedto fight like hell to be recognized.
That's why it's fitting we host this screening during Immigrant Heritage Month[applause]that's what this isthe time when we celebrate the country's immigrant heritage. I want to seeI want you to know, Jill and I, we see you, we value you. We are indirectly a part of you because of our heritage as well in different ethnicities. But when we came, we were not welcome.
You know, and I'll never stop fighting for you, I promise you. Because fighting for youby the way, I love when people say, ""Well, why do we spend so much""do you realize that 26 out of every 100 students in grades kindergarten through 12 speak Spanish?
No, think about it. What in the hellheck are we talking about here? [Laughter]
Today is important for another reason. It marks the 11th anniversary of DACADeferred Action for Childhood Arrivalsone of the proudest accomplishments of the Obama-Biden administration. This has transformed the lives of hundreds of thousands of ""dreamers"" who were brought here as children, who only know America as their home, who make invaluable contributions to our Nation.
Audience member. Here to stay!
The President. As Iyou're damn right, you are. I promise you.
I said in my State of the Union Address we have to provide a pathway to citizenship for ""dreamers""thosealso, those on temporary status, farm workers, essential workers. I'm going to continue to call on Congress to pass this bill that does just that, we've been pushing.
Folks, look[applause]this is important because there are those who've made clear that they don't see you, don't want you in America's future. They demonize the community, undermine the security of this community, you know, and erase the history and contributions of the community. It's outrageous.
We have to speak out. My dad used to use an expression that came from his generation: Silence is complicity. And we will not be silent. Period. I mean it. I mean it.
Ilet me close with this. Last summer, I had the honor of bestowing the Presidential Medal of Freedom on distinguished Americans, including Juliet Garcia, the first Latina to serve as a college president in American history.
And here's what she said. She said, ""My job was always to thrust open doors of opportunity."" ""My job was always to thrust open doors of opportunity."" That's my job as well: thrust open doors of opportunity.
And tonight's film is a reminder of that essential truth: opportunity. It's a cornerstone of our democracy and the American Dream. And as you'll see in the film, that's exactly what the Hispanic community embodies: opportunity and courage.
And let me say one more thing. I've said it before. Nights like this are a reminder of the power of stories, the importance of treating storytellers with dignity andI mean this sincerely. Maybe it's because I'm Irish I think that. But it[laughter].
And by the way, I'm always quoting Irish poets. My colleagues always would kid me. They think that it's because I was Irish. It's not the reason. They happen to be the best poets in the world. That's why I do it. [Laughter]
But all kidding aside, you've got to treat everybody with dignity and respect and the value they deserve. Tell the stories of our Nation. Tell the stories of all of us.
Ladies and gentlemen, here from the White House, Jill and I are honored to present ""Flamin' Hot.""
May God bless you, and may God protect our troops.
Thank you, thank you, thank you. Enjoy the film. Enjoy your house. Enjoy the grounds. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Audience members. Si, se puede! Si, se puede! Si, se puede!

2023-06-14 00:00:00,Remarks at the League of Conservation Voters Capital Dinner,"
Hello, hello, hello! It's good to be home.
Thank you all for those introductions. And I want to get started by thanking League of Conservation Voters Action Fund, Natural Resources Defense Council Fund, NextGen PAC, the Sierra Club for supporting Kamala and me. There is no support I'd rather have. I mean it.
So many of you have been fighting this battle for a long time. And, Cristina, I don't have to tell you that it's the young people in this country in particular who are leading the way. And I mean that sincerely. One of the reasons I'm so incredibly optimistic. This is the best educated, most committed generation in American history, and they're going to take us over the endover theoverjust work it out for us.
You know, many of you have been with me throughout my career, and I can't tell you how much it means to have your support again. I was just saying to Carol Browner that we've known each other a little while. She was 12 when she got started. I was a little older. [Laughter]
And thatyou know, there's an old expression; we joke in the neighborhood I grew up in: ""You go home with them that brung you to the dance."" You all brought me to the dance a long time ago, when I got started. And you know, thanks in particular to the League of Conservations for hosting us tonight. And thank you all for your leadership in so many important issues over the years.
By the way, there's a lot of threats our children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren are going to face. This is the only truly existential threat. It's the existential threat. If we don't meet the requirements that we're looking at, we're in real trouble. Your work has never been more important than it is today. Together, we've made a lot of progress so far, but we've got to finish the job. We've got to finish the job.
And I'm glad to be here to take part in a tribute to my friend, Nancy Pelosi. And she is my friend. I honestly believe Nancy is going to go down in history as one of the most consequential Speakers in American history, and that's a fact. Nancy led the way.
You'd never had to worry when she was leading about whether she would pass the bill. She told you how many votes she had, and she had the exact number she'd tell you. [Laughter] That was really nice. You know, she was right every time, and we worked together a long time. She had the votes for so many life-changing pieces of legislation, including historic legislation to combat the existential threat of climate change.
Folks, last week, millions of Americans sheltered indoors and wore masks outside as they watched the hazea yellow haze. My granddaughter and my daughter were up in New York, and they were taking a picture of my granddaughter's apartment, and you couldn't see a block away. You couldn't see the buildings, the pictures they showed me. You know, that haze settled over our homes and our neighborhoods. And you know, it'sit was a new experience for many Americans; already, the norm for communities across the Western States.
Last year, I, with the EPA and others, traveled in helicopter all the fires that were out West. And you know, I looked down, and I saw more timber burned to the ground than the entire State of Maryland. Not the timber, theif you took a map of Maryland, every singleevery single part of that State, that's how much burned to the ground. Hurricanes and other extreme weather caused $165 billion in damage. And we still have people wondering whether there's a climate change crisis?
Over the past 2 years, a third of Americans have been personally affected by extreme weather events. One-third. Folks, this is what climate change looks like. Only it looks worse if we don't do something now. But I don't have to tell you, it's not inevitable. It is not inevitable. With your help, we're doing something about it by reclaiming our leadership on the world stage; with the leadership that Members of Congress and all of you have madethe largest investment in climate, environmental justice, and conservation ever, anywhere in the entire world.
And by the way, if you don't mind my asking, would all the Members of Congress please stand? All the Members of the[applause].
Well, let me tell you, the Inflation Reduction Act includes $369 billion to combat climate change. And from day one, we've been reducewe've been working to reduce our carbon emissions. Thanks to the historic law, by the year 2030, we'll be reducing emissions on a yearly basis by 1 billion tons a year. One billion tons a year. The law includes tax credits that are going to create tens of thousands of good-paying jobs, clean energy manufacturing jobs.
And if I could hold justdivert for just a second. Some of you were concerned, because I had been so deeply involved in the environmental movement with the folks here. What happened was I didn't announce my environmental plan for the first month after I gotI announced. And everybody wonderedwondered why. Because I said then I was convinced I could bring labor along.
Guess what? Labor is with us. Organized labor. Unions are with us. They're supporting us, particularly the IBEW. It's already attracting billions of dollars in private sector investment, even in districtseven in districtsthat, in fact, you wouldn't expect. Districts that are all over the map. And then it's already attracting that money. Where Members areof Congress voted against the bill, we're still having it.
I made a commitment. I saidlike I said to all my folks when thein theall the Americans in the State of the Union Address: I promise to be President for all the people, so I'll see them on theat the groundbreaking, all these folks. [Laughter] All of them. Even the ones that voted against. You think I'm kidding? You all think I'm kidding. I'm not.
At solar factories in the Midwest and the South; wind farms across the plains, off our shores; electric vehicle plants; clean steel and clean cement projects and so much more all across America. Working families can save thousands of dollars a year on energy costs, including rebates to weatherize their home, tax credits for electric heat pumps, rooftop solar, electric vehicles, new and used.
It's a big deal. It's really starting to have an impact. And we're focusing on communities that have been denied the basic security and basic dignity that comes with clean air, clean water, and clean energy jobs, and that have been denied environmental justice.
I signed an Executive order to make environmental justice the responsibility of every single Federal department in the United States Government. For real. And I made a historic pledge to direct 40 percent of all the benefits from these Federal investments in climate change and clean energy to communities that have been left behind for much too long.
With your support, we're living up to that pledge. It's called my Justice40 Initiative, making the biggest investments ever in frontlinefrontline, fence-line communities that have been smothered by the legacy of pollution.
Replacewe're replacing every single lead pipe in America. We're cleaning up old industry sites. Look, we're including brownfields and supersitesSuperfund sites. And with the brightyou know, we havethe blight of communities is there for decades that have been just clobbered.
All across Appalachia, the Southwest, we're plugging abandoned wellsgas and oil wells that leak methane and dangerous gasescreating jobs paying the same amount of money to those workers that dug the wells in the first place to cap those wells.
We're helping school districts across the country electrify their schoolbuses so kids don't have to breathe the polluted air from diesel exhaust. We're doing the same for the cities and towns. And just today, the Treasury Department issued guidance so, for the first time, local communities, including churches, nonprofits, can take advantage of the clean energy tax credits that are going to bring cleaner air and cost savings to every corner of America.
We're also taking historic action to preserve our country's land and water. In my first week in office, I issued the Executive order establishing the country's first-ever national conservation goal. We called it ""America the Beautiful."" And it's a nationwide campaign to conserve by 2030 at least 30 percent of the lands, waters that support and sustain our Nation. Thirty percent. And we're getting it done.
Anybody from Colorado here? Camp Hale50,000 acres protected. Boundary Waters in Minnesota225,000 acres protected. Spirit Mountain in Nevada500,000 acres. The Castner Range in Texas6,600 acres. Chaco Canyon330,000 acres in New Mexico. Bristol Bay and the Tongass Forest9 million acres in Alaska. All protected. And the list goes on.
We're working to designate 777770,000 square miles in the Pacific Ocean as a new national marine sanctuary. And we're going to get it done. This is an area larger than Alaska and Colorado put together and almost three times the size of Texas. It would make it the largest ocean area on the planet with the highest level of protection.
Look, folks, in just my first year in office, weand I mean ""we""; all of us in this roomprotected more lands and waters than any President since John F. Kennedy. And on day one of my Presidency, we moved to reenter the Paris accord, because the United States should lead the worldlead the worldin climate.
Last December, the world did follow our lead when countries across the globe committed to safeguarding at least 30 percent of the lands and waters worldwide by 2030. And by the way, there's more than when we just say they're off limit. We're paying farmers to plant carbon-absorbing plants. We're paying farmers to put more in conversation.
We've mobilized the world's leading emitters to help poorer countries deal with the impacts of climate change. They called it, at the G-7, the Build Back BidenBuild Back Better. And we realized that got confusing. [Laughter] So now we don't call it that. What we call it ishere's the bottom line: Look, we're the ones that caused the problemthe United States. We cleared all our land. We did all the things thatto make ourmake things more easy for us to make money. Not a bad thing at the time. No one really fully understood. But we, the major emitters in the world, have an obligation to help those countries.
You know, soonsoonAfrica will have 1 billion people. China has their Belt and Road Initiative. It turned out to be their debt and destruction initiative. No, I'm serious. Not a joke. Well, we're going toin, and we're going to help.
We have plans to build a railroad from the Pacific all the way across the Indian Ocean. We have plans to build in Angola one of the largest solar plants in the world. I can go on, but I'm not. I'm going off script. I'm going to get in trouble. [Laughter]
But look, at the U.N. Conference in Glasgow, Scotland, we launched the Global Methane Pledge. When I raised it inside with a small group of people, they said, ""I think we can do that."" We helped recruit over 100 countries to follow the lead in setting strong standards to tackle methane pollution, oil and gas operations, and holding companies accountable.
Unfortunately, our MAGA Republicans in Congress are trying to undo theall the progress we've made. They made it abundantly clear when the first bill they passed, this new Congresswhile they were holding the country hostage over the debt limitwas to repeal the climate provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act and replace them with handouts to the fossil fuel industry. Not a joke. Literally.
We made clearthey made clear that we'd ratherthey'd rather threaten the default of the U.S. economy than cut or get rid of, for example, $30 billion in taxpayer subsidies to oil companies who made $200 million last yearbillion. I said ""million."" Billion dollars last year.
Imagine the choice. Imagine seeing all this happenthe wildfires, storms, floodsand doing nothing about it. Imagine taking away those clean energy jobs from working-class folks all across the country. Imagine turning your back on all those moms and dads living in towns poisoned by pollution and telling them, ""Sorry, you're on your own."" I was determined not to let that happen. And with your significant help, we didn't let it happen.
You know, we started negotiations, and the MAGA Republicans in Congressand they had a bullseye on the Inflation Reduction Act. They wanted to gut it. That wouldremember, that was their original proposal. They wanted to gut it. We didn't budge. In the end, we didn't just protect some of the climate and clean energy provisions. No. We protected every single, solitary one of them. Every one.
The ink isn't even dry on our agreement, and they're back at it again with a bill last week to repeal those clean energy tax credits that they attached billions of dollars in investments to, creating tens of thousands of jobs. And with your help, we're going to stop them again.
Let me close with this. Look, I was one of the first people to introduce a climate bill in the United States Senate way back in 1986. And I come from the State of DuPont. [Laughter] Oh, excuse me, State of Delaware. [Laughter] We have more corporations incorporated in Delaware than every other State in the Union combined. But I was convinced we had to begin this.
When I was running for President, I made it a priority to meet with environmental justice leaders in fence-line communities. Their stories were unforgettable, and I knew they were true.
I grew up in Claymont, Delaware, on the Pennsylvania State line, where that arch goes up in Delaware, right along the Delaware River. There are more oil refineries in Marcus Hook, in that area, than any place including Houston, Texas, taking care of 10 million people in the region.
And we livedwhen we moved there, we lived in a place called Brookview Apartments. And what used to be I-95what's now I-95. It used to beit's called the Philadelphia Pike. It was from Wilmington and Philadelphia. And it was a four-lane access road, but it was too dangerous for a third-grade kid to walk to school. It was only about a half a mile. So my mother would drive me to school every day.
Whatweon cue, from the first major frost and thein the late fall, my mom would get in the car, turn on the windshield wiper to the get the dew off of it, and there'd be oil slicksliterally, oil slickson the windshield.
How many folks across the country have had similar experiences? As a result, saw higher-than-usual rates of childhood asthma, cancer. For the longest time, Delaware had one of the highest cancer rates in America, in large part because the winds blow east, not north or south.
Today, those communities across the countrythere's people living downwind from these factories, seeing theliterally the paint on their cars peel off because the air is so corrosive. Landfills and garbage incinerators located right in the middle of communities. Drinking water contaminated by radon and arsenic. That kind of inequity and injustice doesn't just go against everything we stand for as a nation.
And so, when I got elected President, with Kamala's partnership, we vowed to enact the most ambitious climate and environmental justice campaign in American history. And that's exactly what we've done with your help.
We've made a lot of progress, but there's so much more to do: getting to 100 percent clean energy by 2035; moving to all-electric vehicles in the future, made in America; building 500,000 EV charging stations from coast to coast; conserving 30 percent of our lands and waters by 2030. And with your help, I'm optimistic we're going to get it done, especially with the support of so many young people across this country representing your organizations.
You represent the best of us. That's not hyperbole. You represent the best of us. That's the God's truth. And you are as important as any group in foreign policy dealing with national concerns, because this is, as I saidI'll end where I beganthe existential threat to humanity. So let's finish the job. Let's keep going.
Every time I'd walk out of my Grandpop Finnegan's house up in Scranton, he'd yell, ""Joey, keep the faith."" And my grandmother would yell: ""No, Joey, spread it. Spread it."" Let's remember who we are. We're the United States of America. There is nothing, nothing beyond our capacity when we do it together.
God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.
Thank you, thank you, thank you. We've got a lot of work to do. A lot of work to do. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We can do this!

2023-06-13 00:00:00,Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and an Exchange With Reporters,"
President Biden. Well, Mr. Secretary General, it's great to have you here. It's good to see you again.
And theI apologize for having to reschedule yesterday. I had a lot of fun yesterday afternoon. [Laughter] WeI had a little toothache problem they took care of. And thank you for accommodating me.
And your leadership in the alliance has throughbeen through a really significant period, in terms of dealing with NATO's relationship with Ukraine. And you know, I think you've done an incredible job.
We saw each other last in Warsaw. And I think you said it, and I agree: The NATO allies have never been more united. We both worked like hell to make sure that happened. [Laughter] And so far, so good.
And I think it'sand we see our joint strength in modernizing the relationship within NATO, as well as providing assistance to defense capabilities to Ukraine.
And we see it in Finland's recent accession into NATO. I remember you and I talkingI think I said to you; I know I said to othersthat Putin was making a mistake. He was looking for the Finlandization of NATO. He got the NATOization of Finland
Secretary General Stoltenberg. Yes.
President Biden. and hopefully, Sweden very shortly.
And theyour friendship and leadership has meant a great deal.
We're strengthenedwe alsowe've strengthened NATO's eastern flank, made it clear that we'll defend every inch of NATO territory. And I say it again: The commitment of the United States to NATO's article 5 is rock solid.
And, at our summit in Lithuania next month, we're going to be building on that momentum, from working to ensure that allies spend enough on the defense, the 2 percentnot just as a hike, but that's the bottom line.
And NATO's engagement as well, weyou know, I've kept you completely informed of my discussions with Japan and South Korea and the Pacific. I think this is the first time ever we've had a major Pacific power engaged in dealing with aggression in Europe.
And so I want to thank you again, Secretary General, for your partnership, your friendship, and most importantly, your leadership of NATO.
Secretary General Stoltenberg. President Biden, dear Joe, thank you so much for the warm words. And thank you for taking the time to meet with me, once again, here at the White House. It's really a great honor and pleasure to meet you.
But most of all, thank you for your leadership, for your strong, personal commitment to the transatlantic bond, to Europe and North America standing together.
And let me also thank the U.S. Congress and the people of America for the strong support to Ukraine. And you just made a new announcement of additional U.S. support, and that is something which is very much welcomed.
European allies and Canada are also doing their part, with tens of billions in military and economic support for Ukraine. And the support that we are providing together to Ukraine is now making a difference on the battlefield as we speak, because the offensive is launched, and the Ukrainians are making progress, making advances.
It's still early days, but what we do know is that the more land Ukrainians are able to liberate, the stronger hand they will have at the negotiating table, and also, the more likely it will be that President Putin at some stage will understand that he will never win this war of aggression onat the battleon the battlefield.
Then I think we also have to realize that Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine was not only an attack on Ukraine, but also on our core values and on free people everywhere. And therefore, President Putin must not win this war, because that will not only be a tragedy for Ukrainians, but also make the world more dangerous.
It will besend a message to authoritarian leaders all over the world, also China, that when they use military force, they get what they want, and we will then become more vulnerable. So it's our security interest to support Ukraine.
And that's exactly what we will do when we meetall the NATO leadersat the summit in Vilnius next month, where we'll agree to sustain and step up our support to Ukraine, further strengthen our deterrence on defense, including by new commitment to invest more in defense. And I expect allies to agree that 2 percent of GDP for defense has to be a minimum of what allies have to invest in our shared security.
We'll strengthen our partnership with our Indo-Pacific partners. And then, of course, we all look forward to welcoming Sweden as a full-fledged member of the alliance as soon as possible.
So, once again, Mr. President, thank you for your leadership. Thank you for your strong commitment. And I look forward to welcome you at the NATO summit in Vilnius.
President Biden. Well, in no small part because of your leadership, we've gotbeyond NATO, we've gotten another 30-somethingwell, a total of 40 nations that are committed to the independence of Ukraine. And I think it's a real clear message.
So, God willing, we're going to be able to keep this unity up. And thank you for your leadership.
Q. President, have you discussed
Q. Mr. President, have your read the Trump indictment, sir?
Q. [Inaudible]Ukrainian
Q. Do you agree with Dr. Biden that she was surprised Republicans
[At this point, several reporters spoke at once.]
Ukraine 
Q. Sir, how's that offensive going, do you think? How's the offensive going, do you think?
President Biden. I'll let Ukraine think for themselves.

Joseph R. Biden, Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and an Exchange With Reporters Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/363415 "
2023-06-13 00:00:00,Remarks at a Reception for United States Chiefs of Mission and an Exchange With Reporters,"
The President. Hello, hello, hello! Please. I look around this room and think, ""What the hell happened to my administration? Why aren't you here permanently in Washington?"" [Laughter] I need help.
All kidding aside, you areI don't know if you fully understand how much you've done. Seriously, think about it. I've got to tell you one story before I begin.
The first meeting I hadand some of you know thiswas at the G-7 in England right after I was elected. And I sat down, andI guess I can tell this. [Laughter] I sat down with the other heads of state, and I turned to Macronwho was on my left, I believe it wasand said, ""Well, America is back."" Know what the response was? He wasn't being facetious either. ""For how long? For how long?""
And then the Chancellor of Germany said, ""What would you think, Mr. President, if tomorrow you picked up the paper here in England, and the London paper had a headline, 'A Thousand People Storm the Parliament, Break Down the Doors of the House of Commons To Protest the Investiture of the Next Secretary""or ""the Next Prime Minister of England'? What would you think?""
And I started to think about it. Imagine what we would have thought here in America. And imagine what the rest of the world thought. It's not a political statement, just a factual statement. What the rest of the world thought when, as Madeleine Albright used to say, ""the essential nation"" had something even more consequential happen.
And so you are incredibly consequential to everythingeverythingeverything that this nation is able to do or not do to rebuild our confidence around the world.
And you know, I was talking to this with our Ambassador to Mexico when Iwe talked about this being an inflection point. Remember? And I said that: ""You know, we have enormous opportunity. We're at a real inflection point in American history.""
An inflection point, my physics professor would say, was a point where you're going down the highway at 60 miles an hour, and you take a rapid turn at a right angle or at a 30-degree angle going in an opposite direction. You can never get back on the track. And your destiny has changed, at least for a couple of generations. And we're at one of those inflection points.
And so it's important. We really did, Tony and I and others, and some of you in this room sat with me during the period. We had to put things back together. And I'm not talking about an individual man, I'm talking about the state of the world at the time. We're at one of those inflection points.
And what we do over the next couple years and the last several years are going to determine what the country looks like. And it's presumptuous to say, and it's going to sound like an egotistical thing for an American President to say, but what America does, how well we do our job, is going to determine what the next four or five generations are going to look like. I really mean that. The postwar period is over. We're building a whole new international system in effect, in terms of relationships with one another.
And so, Secretary Blinken, thank you for your incredibleand I mean it sincerelyleadership and your dedication to the womenmen and women of the State Department. It's real. This guy feels it in his bones. And our Ambassadors and Chargs, welcome to the White Housea second time in 2 days. [Laughter] Thanks for coming back.
I said I had a root canal, and the press said, ""Well, is hewell, was he unconscious?"" [Laughter] Unfortunately, no, I was wide awake. [Laughter] I'm sorry to push this reception back by a day, but I'm glad to be able to host all of you. I really mean it.
Usually, it's the other way around. I know the worst phrase in the English language is, for all of you, ""The President is coming."" [Laughter] You're all shaking your heads. You know I'm telling the truth. [Laughter] Because when I show up, it's all hands on deck. It's like, ""Oh, God, where are we going?"" But we're going to create a lot of work here along the way.
And every country I've visited, with the single exception of IrelandI mean, Ireland is different. [Laughter] That was even a more difficult job for Claire. [Laughter] ""What the hell are we going to do with all these people, Mr. President?""
But at any rate, I wanted to take this chance to say, from the bottom of my heart: Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. You're not only changing America's image, you're in the process of changing the world, moving in the right direction. Think of the fundamental things that have alreadyyou've already accomplished.
Thank you for the work representing our country overseas, protecting America's interest all around the world. And thank you for the leadership you provide to the Foreign Service Officers, to the Civil Service, to the developmental professionals, to locally employed people you have in your mission, and for everyone at your mission who bring diplomacy to life. And you really do.
You'd be amazedparentheticallyyou'd be amazed how many heads of stateTony has been in the meetings and so have our folks here in the foreignand who do foreign policy in the White House. The number of heads of state who come and say ""thank you,"" for you, not to me""thank you"" for you. And thank him for the persons that he sent. I picked a couple of you, but you know. [Laughter]
But all kidding aside, thank you for helping put diplomacy back at the centerthe centerof American foreign policy. It used to be that, and then once it just seemed to start to evaporate a little bit.
Each timeand each of you and each of the teams of theeach of the teams of diplomats you lead have made a promise a reality. We've begun to rebuild the global network of alliances, for real so that today they're stronger than ever. We formed innovative ways to partnership like AUKUS, elevated the Quad, taking on the challenges of what will be adefine ourliterally define our future.
We're building a more stable, integrated, more peaceful, Middle East. Long haul, but it's hard, but we're making some progress.
We've strengthened our leadership at the United Nations, in no small part to our gifted Ambassador. Thank you, Ambassador.
And other international organizationseven, you know, Gitenstein. [Laughter] Everybody knows how everythingeverybody thinks we're brothers. You'd better keep doing a good job. You're going to reflect on me a lot. You know what I mean? [Laughter]
But all kidding aside, we've elevated our regional engagement across the board, from our work with NATO and the EU, to the ASEAN and Pacific Islands Forum, to the Gulf Cooperation Council, to the U.S. African Leadersexcuse meLeaders' Summit, to the Summit of the Americas. Because of all the work you've put in, we've been able to rally the world to take on the greatest challenges of our time.
What are they? I've been standing against the brutal war that Putin is waging against the people of Ukraine, helping them defend themselves. Because if we didn't, imagine what happens. Think about it. Not a joke.
If I told any of youand I would have been mildly prophetic if I had said itbefore we were elected, when we were running, that there would be 138- to 140,000 people in Europe invading another country, I think you would have looked at me like I was crazy. Maybe some of you wouldn't, but most would.
Managing the competition with China so that it doesn't turn into conflicttip into a conflict. It need not do that.
Addressing the existential threat of climate change in a real way for the first time. It is the existential threat to humanity. It is the existential threat to humanity. I hope I have no climate doubters out there, because it's real.
Investing in global health to address today's challenges and to ensure we're better prepared for the next pandemic, for there will be another pandemic. There will be another pandemic.
Tracking food insecurity for people around the world to feed their children. The Global South is in real trouble because of what Russia is doing and what's happening in terms of exports from Ukraine.
Driving inclusive economic growth so no one is left behind. That's a bold statement, saying ""no one is left behind."" But that should be our goal: that no one is left behind.
Advancing democracy and human rights so that we can live in freedom. I just met with the President ofanyway, I won't get into that. I guess I shouldn't start down the line. [Laughter] I'll leave somebody out.
But I'm grateful for the work you and your teams do every single day and your incredible skill and your professionalism. And that includes our Ambassador to Japan. Where is he? [Laughter]
Audience member. He's hosting Jake.
The President. He's hosting Jake? Oh, that's right. [Laughter] Oh, my God. Jake andoh. [Laughter]
He's doing a hell of a job, and he's liking it. [Laughter] And guess what? I had the Prime Minister pull me aside, ""I like your Ambassador."" [Laughter] I said, ""You ain't seen nothing yet."" [Laughter]
No, all kidding asidebut alllook, we're in a situation where, you know, the combination of political appointees and the professional State Department personnel, you know, you've got to take a message of thanks back to your teams. I really mean it. I mean it sincerely. I visited some of your Embassies. You know I mean it when I speak to them.
And by the way, I might add, to your spouses and their spousesif they have a significant other with them. Because when you appoint someone Ambassador, you appoint two people Ambassador if they're married, if they have a significant other with them.
The second part of my message is this: We've got to keep it up. We've got to double down right now. It's only going to get harder from here. But it's closer, but it's going get harder.
The word is, as I said again, the inflection point. The decisions we made todayI used to have a physics professor talk about: An inflection point, you're going down the highway at 60 miles an hour, and all of a sudden, you take a hard right turn. You're never going to get back on the path you were for at least another couple decades. That's where we are.
But we have such an opportunity to make things even better than you've begun to make them. We can't pick and choose between addressing geopolitical crises and transnational threats. We've got to sustain America's core advantage to outcompete China, to defend the principles of the U.N. Charter against Russia's brazen attacks, while also leading the world to address the issues that impact all nations.
[At this point, the President cleared his throat.]
Excuse me.
We've got to work with our partners to shape and update the rules of the road on issues like trade and technology and, shortly, artificial intelligence, which is going to become a gigantic issue for all of us to be better informed on. So the international system is equipped to meet the challenge of this new age. And it is a new age.
And to do this work, we need to harness the strength and talents of our country's full diversity. We have to protect the values and ideals we hold most dear, and drive 21st-century diplomacy and effectively pursue our interests abroad. That's where y'all come in, as you know.
You're on the frontlines of this effort, literallynot joking, literallyleading intense diplomacy alongside intense competition. They're not easy to do at the same time. We need to make sure people around the world know the United States stands for not just what we're against, but American values. The way we do business has always been a part of our world, what wewhat we think.
You know, again, parenthetically, Iand the press has heard me say this before, so I apologize for the repetition. You know, I've, allegedly, met more face to face with Xi Jinping than any world leader has. They keepas you guys who are in the intelligence side, you know they keep meticulous hours and times. And I think we're up to 85 hours, just he and I68 of them alone over a 10-year period. Because when he was Vice President and Barack was President, he knew whowho was going to succeed, but it wasn't appropriate for the President to be with him a lot. So we traveled 17-, 18-, 17- to 18,000 miles together in China and the United States.
And I had a lot of personaljust one-on-one conversations. And we hadeach had a simultaneous interpreter. I turned all my notes in. [Laughter] Butand that's not a reference to the Presidentthe former President. But look[laugher]no, it really isn't. [Laughter]
Because, lookso we want to share a positive vision of the future. We want to build with our partnersnot against anybody, but with people. Engage with them in the interests that we share and help developing nations deliver the biggest priorities for their people.
That's why the new appointee to the World Bank is someone who isone who's going to try like hell to make sure that middle income countries can qualify for concessional aid. We have towe have an opportunity not only to help our diplomacy, but to help people around the world.
When we were at the G-7, we talked aboutone of the meetings wasthey used to call the Build Back Better World. It's not that now. It's the PIII [PGII; White House correction]P-triple-I. And what it is isyou know, you have an awful lot of African nationwell, the Belt and Road Initiative of the Chineseit's ended up being a noose and debt instead of belt and road, because it's not working very well for them. And so there's a hell of a lot of debt and a lot of demands that are being made.
We have an opportunity to take everything frommoving back to debt relief, moving back to making sure we havewe deal with the climate issues.
Weyou know, our investments in Africa, for examplethere are going to be a billion people in Africa very shortly. And the ideaI know our infrastructure people are working on the possibility of a railroad from the Atlantic all the way across the continent so they have a means of transporting goods and materials all the way to the Indian Ocean. We're in a situation where we're talking about Angola having one of the largest solar facilities in the world. It's in our interest that that happen, in addition to helping other countries.
How are we going to deal with climate change as we engage the rest of the world and it's beneficial to everybody? Nations around the world choose to work with us not because of our force or threats of coercion, but because we understand what they can do better and what we can do better as well.
We know when our partners are stronger and more capable, and when there's an opportunity to make Americait's an opportunity to make the American people safer and better, when everybody does better. For real.
Make no mistake: The challenges we face are great. But our capacity to meet the moment is real.
And I've heardthey've heard me say this before, and I mean it: I've been aroundI know I don'tI know I look like I'm only still 29, but[laughter]I've been around a long time. And as one of my friends said, ""Just try to connect age and wisdom.""
But I've been around a long time. And I'vebut I've never been more optimisticnot because I'm President. I've never been more optimistic about America's future. The opportunities are immense in this moment of change.
And we're investing in our strengths at home. We're investing in our strengths abroad. The alliances and partnerships that you maintain and deepen every day are the heart of our strategic advantage in the world. And that's truth. No other nation comes close to matching us, not because I'm President, because of you and the policies you're pursuing.
So thank you again. I mean it from the bottom of my heart. Thank you again for all you do to ensure the future we're building is nono one that will be more prosperous and more securer than our children. That's what this gets down to.
So let me close. I've probably already gone on too long.
But may God protect our troops, our diplomats, and all those who serve our Nation. And that's what you're doing: You're serving our Nation.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[The President stepped away from the podium and spoke briefly to the audience using a hand-held microphone. His remarks were inaudible because the microphone was turned off; no transcript was provided. He then concluded as follows.]
Thank you! [Laughter]
Q. Mr. President
Q. Mr. President, are you surprised that Republicans are defending Trump despite his arrest and indictment?
Q. Are there tapes that you accepted bribes, President Biden? Is that true?
Former President Donald J. Trump 
Q. Would you comment on the arrest of the former President, sir?
The President. No.

Joseph R. Biden, Remarks at a Reception for United States Chiefs of Mission and an Exchange With Reporters Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/363416 "
2023-06-13 00:00:00,Remarks at a Juneteenth Concert,"
My name is Joe Biden. I'm Ashley's father. [Laughter] She's the love of my life and the life of my love. I know I couldn't be prouder of her.
Thank you all for being here: our outstanding Vice President, Kamala Harris; the Second Gentleman. Members of the Cabinet and the Congress.
Grandmother to the movement of Juneteenth, a Federal holiday, Ms. Opal Lee. Opal, thank you for being here. You're the reason we're here, in large part.
And a special thanks to tonight's gifted performers.
You know, I was leaning over and telling Kamala: I've followed some tough acts. [Laughter] I've spoken before Nobel Prize winners. I've spoken before theafter the Pope. I've spoken to everythe Medal of Honor winners, military heroes. But, my Lord, I've never spoken before a group like this. [Laughter]
I had the honor to bestow some of our Nation's highest awards to some of our most important Black artists, writers, performers, producers, theater and ballet companies. To paraphrase Maya Angelou, ""People will never forget how you make them feel."" And you all made us feel incredibly well.
Tonight's performers helped us feel the power of Juneteenth and Black Music Month, among other things.
As Kamala described earlier to honor the true meaning of Juneteenth, our entire administration is continuing the charge forward to literally redeem the soul of America. When I announced I was running the first time, I said I was running for three reasons. And even some of my staff thought I was crazy. I said onethe first reason is to restore the soul of America. Restore decency and honor.
Let me just add this: To me, making Juneteenth a Federal holiday wasn't just a symbolic gesture. It was a statement of fact for this country to acknowledge the origin oforiginal sin of slavery. To understand the war [that; White House correction] was never fought over itit wasn't just about a Union, but it was most fundamentally about the country and freedom.
To remember the Emancipation Proclamation wasn't just a document, it captured the essence of freedom that galvanized the country. It proved that some ideas are more powerful; they can't be denied. It's a reminder that the promise of America is we all are created equal in the image of God, and we deserve to be treated equally throughout our entire lives.
We're the most unique country in Americain the world. Other countries are founded based on faith, on ethnicity, on other things, religion. But wewe are founded on an idea. An idea unlike any other country in the world, that we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men and women are created equal, endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights.
While we've never fully lived up to that promise, we've never walked away from it either. On our best days, enough of us have the guts and the heart to stand up for the best in us. It matters. It really matters.
As the past few years remind us, our freedoms have been put at risk by racism that's still too powerful a force. You know, I was a kid in the civil rights movement, and I used to thinkI honestly believed that you could defeat hate. But hate only hides. It hides under the rocks. And when given oxygenjust a little oxygenit comes roaring back out again. And we have to stand up and deny it the oxygen.
So Juneteenth, as a Federal holiday, is meant to breathe a new life into the very essence of America, to make sure all Americans feel the power of this day and the progress we can make as a country; to choose love over hate, unity over disunion, and progress over retreat. Choosing to remember history, not erase it; to read books, not ban them, no matter how hard some people try.
That's what's great about it. That's what great nations do. And we're a great nation.
Let me conclude with this: As your President, I visited Tulsa, Oklahoma, to say what happened there on Wall Streeton Black Wall Street 102 years ago was not a riot; it was a race massacre. It wasn't a riot; it was a race massacre.
And from the pulpit of Ebenezer, from the bridge of Selma, in front of a graduating class at Howard, we've prayed, we've marched, we've celebrated. And here at the White House, we've hosted champion teams with Black athletes continuing a legacy of social activism and advocacy.
I signed a law, a hundred years in the making, tobelieve it or not, to make lynching a Federal hate crime and hosted the first screening of the ""Till,"" a movie a hundred years after ""The Birth of a Nation"" was screened in the same room.
Folks, my message on these occasions and on this Juneteenth day is, we've got to go forward. We have to move forward together. When we choose to protect the freedoms we all deservewhen they are attacked, that's when we cannot remain silent. Silence is complicity.
To heal the wounds of division so racism no longer tears us apart, we have to choose to be believers in a dream, doers of the world.
As the gospel song goes: ""We've come too far from where we started. Nobody told me that the road would be easy. I don't believe He brought me this far to leave me.""
My fellow Americans, I don't think the Lord brought us this far[applause]the good Lord brought us this far to leave us behind. We just have to remember who we are. We're the United States of America, and there's nothingnothingbeyond our capacity when we act together!
So happy Juneteenth! Bless you all. May God protect our troops. Thank you very much. Let's get the job done! Let's get the job done!

2023-06-10 00:00:00,Remarks at a Pride Celebration,"
The President. Hello, hello, hello.
Audience members. Joe! Joe! Joe!
The President. Hello, hello, hello.
You know, I was a lucky guykid. I had a dad and a mom whowho understood that we meant what we said in ourthat sounds cornyin ourwe're the most unique nation in the world. We're the only nation that is founded on an ideanot geography, not religion, and not ethnicitythat all men and women are created equal, endowed by their Creator, et cetera.
I'll never forget, I was going down to get an application, when I was in high school, to be a lifeguard in the city pool. And my dad was driving me down on his way to workgoing to drop me off.
And Wilmington, Delaware, is the corporate capital of the world. It was anyway. And[laughter]but all kidding aside, there's a place called Rodney Square. And the DuPont Building was there; the Hercules building was thereall these major corporations.
And I was getting out of the car to go into thein the city hall. And there were these two well-dressed men standing on a corner. The light changed. They kissed each other and went in different directions. One went to the DuPont Building; one went to the Hercules building.
And I had never seen that before. I looked at my dad. He looked back at me. He said: ""It's simple. They love each other. It's simple."" And to me, it's that simple. It's that straightforward.
Scarlet, thank you for introducing me and theand for the hope and optimism you and your family represent for our entire country.
And to all of you: Happy Pride Month. Happy Pride year. Happy Pride life.
We're joined today by leaders across our administration, which has more proud staff at every level than any administration in American history. Our Secretary of Transportation, Pete Buttigieg.
And we have the first and second transgender Americans to thebe confirmed by the United States Senate in history: Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services Admiral Rachel Levine and Under Secretary of Defense Shawn Skelly.
And by the wayby the way, I am proud that back home in Delaware the first transgender State legislator in American history, Sarah McBride.
I also want to thank two people who couldn't be here, but who made this possible: My dear friend Tim Gill and his husband Scott Miller, who is doing a terrific job as my Ambassador to Switzerland.
And it's wonderful to welcome all of you to theand over a thousand Americans from all across the country. We're gathered here today to honor the extraordinaryand I'm not being solicitousthe extraordinary courage and contributions of the LGBTQ community, to celebrate their legacy and their progress.
And we welcome to the largest Pride Month celebration ever held at the White House. But just the beginning. Jill and I, Kamala and Doug, the entire administration are doing everything we can to advance equality for the LGBTQ community in our Nationthe entire Nation.
As Commander in Chief, I was proud to have ended the ban on transgender Americans serving in the United States military. I signed historic Executive orders strengthening civil rights protections for
[At this point, the President responded to movement from an audience member.]
He's running from me; I don't know where he is going. [Laughter] Do that again, man. You're a sprinter. I canyou can[laughter]I don't know if he's running to something or from something. I don't know. [Laughter]
But look, we providewe put protections for housing, employment, health care, education, and the justice system. We're combating dangerous and cruel practices of conversion therapy. We're launching a new national strategy to end HIV epidemic by 2030by 2030. We're working with communities to treat and contain the M-pox outbreak. We're ending the disgraceful practice of banning gay and bisexual men from donating blood.
Making human rights for LGBTQ people around the worldnot just here, around the worlda top priority for my foreign policy, including a review of our engagement with Uganda following its recent antigay law, the most extreme in the world.
And last December, we felt such pride here on the South Lawn when I signed the historic Respect for Marriage Act. It protects the marriage of same-sex and interracial couples.
But, for all the progress we've made, we knowwe knowa real change and real challenges still remain. When a person can be married in the morning and thrown out of a restaurant for being gay in the afternoon, something is still very wrong in America. That's why the Congress must pass and send me the Equality Act to codify protections for LGBT community.
Joining us today are survivors of the Club Q and Pulsethe shootings that took placewho remind us why we must fully implement the significant gun law that we passedthe most significant in 30 yearsthat I signed. But it's not done yet. We have to ban assault weapons. And[applause].
You know, and when families across the country face excruciating decisions to relocate to a different State to protect their child from dangerous anti-LGBTQ laws, we have to act. We have to act as a nation. We need to push back against the hundreds of callous and cynical bills and laws introduced in States targeting transgender children, terrifying families, and criminalizing doctors and nurses.
These bills and laws attack the most basic values and freedoms we have as Americansthat's not hyperbole; that's a fact: the right to be yourself, the right to make your own health decisions, the right to raise your own children.
I recognize, for a lot of folks across this country, maybe it's not you, your kid, your family member going through whatever a transgender child and family is going through. But I think we all agree, if it were you, you'd want the space to figure it out with your family and your doctornot being told by anybody.
Look, I think we can all agree: No oneno oneshould have to fear for their safety in this country. No one should be singled out or demonized or made to feel less than anyone else. There are some things we should never question or put at risk: your life, safety, your dignity. They can never be put at risk, and they are still.
You know, too many people in the LGBT community are worried and afraid about their future and their safety. So today I want to send a message to the entire community, especially to transgender children: You are loved. You are heard. You are understood. And you belong!
And as I've made clear, including in my State of the Union Address, your President and my entire administration has your back. We see who you are: made in the image of God, deserving of dignity, respect, and support.
Two days ago, I announced a series of new initiatives we're taking to protect the LGBT communityQ community. First, ensuring your physical safety. Whether you're organizing a Pride parade, running a small business, or just trying to focus at school, you should haveyou shouldn't have to deal with bomb threats, harassment, and violent attacks.
That's why the Department of Homeland Security, with the support of the Department of Justice and the Department of Health and Human Services, is launching a safety partnership that's going to provide critical training and support to the community; dedicated resources to better protect festivals, marches, community centers, and businesses; to better protect health care providers serving the community; and help folks report hate crimes.
Second, we're taking to civilwe're taketaking on these civil rights violations, because that's what they are. An examplefor example, we're addressing how the growing threat tobook bans may violate the Federal civil rights laws when they target LGBTQ students or students of color and create hostile classroom environments.
Third, we're investing in the future of LGBTQ kids. Last year, we launched a nationwide crisis hotline for the LGBTQ youth who are feeling isolated and overwhelmed. If you need help, if you're worried, if you're just concernednot sure what to do, you need somebody to talk to, you can now pick up the phone and call 9-8-8 and talk to a counselor who can give you help.
And don't hesitate to call. This year, we're committing more mental health resources and new funding for programs that help families support and affirm their kids, a new Federal initiative to address the LGBQ homelessness, new proposed regulations requiring States to protect LGBTQ kids in foster care, and so much more.
Let me close with this. I know it's hot out there, and you're probably, ""When is the man going to finish?"" [Laughter]
[The President pretended to drop the microphone.]
[Laughter] Let me close with what I see today.
Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!
The President. Well, thank you.
Well, let me close with what I see today at the White House, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart. I see families who testified in State capitols against laws stripping them of their freedom. I see students who are leading walkouts and protests of hateful bills like ""Don't Say Gay.""
In all of youand this is not hyperbolein all of you what I see is courage. And I mean it sincerely from the bottom of myI see courage. Courage.
And those who were in the generation before you who stepped up, it's even more courage. They worried not only for their lives, they worried for their jobs. They worried for whether or not they could even be involved at all in the community. Imagine what it took 40 years ago to stand up and say, ""I'm gay."" What would have happened? No, I mean, people who had to fear for their lives just acknowledging itjust acknowledging it.
We all talk about courage. Well, I see more courage on this lawn than I've seen in any time in the recent past.
But the thing about y'all is, you not only are about courage. You generate so much hope for people, hope and light. You enrich every part of American life: educators, entertainers, entrepreneurs, athletes, actors, artists, scientists, scholars, diplomats, doctors, servicemembers, veterans, and so much more.
As I saidI mean this; I swear to Godyou're some of the mostyou're some of the bravest and most inspiring people I've ever known. And I've known a lot of good folks. You set an example for the Nation and, quite frankly, for the world. You know, we all move forward when we move together with your joy, with your pride lighting the way.
So today let us proudly remember who we are: the United States of America. And there is nothing, nothing beyond America's capacity when we decide to do it together, as you're doing today. We shall get better every single year.
Happy Pride. Enjoy the celebration.
And in just a few minutes, Jill's going to come back and introduce a performer who embodies joy of this community.
God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.

2023-06-09 00:00:00,"Remarks on Signing an Executive Order on Advancing Economic Security for Military and Veteran Spouses, Military Caregivers, and Survivors in Fort Liberty, North Carolina","
The President. Hello, Fort Liberty. It's great to be back at ""the center of the universe""especially with all you crazy guys that jump out of planes. [Laughter]
Tiffany, thanks so much for that introduction and for your family's service to our country.
General Donahue and Command Sergeant Major Holland; general officers; the Governor of the great State of North Carolina, who's here with us; the Congressman from the district, who's here with us: It's an honor to be here with you this afternoon.
I'm not going to take a lot of your time.
You know, people like to joke that when the President calls 9-1-1, the phone rings at Fort Liberty. [Laughter] Well, that's not too far from the truth. When you answer, you answer freedom's call every time. Youit's you who take on so many of the nationalsthe Nation's toughest missions.
You deploy quickly and quietly. You risk your safety and protect the safety of Americans all across the world and all around the world. I've been in over 80 countries seeing how you work, and you're incredible. We literally have the single finest fighting force in the history of the world. That is not hyperbole. That's a fact. [Applause] That is a fact.
And as the English poet John Milton once wrote, ""They also serve who only stand and wait."" In the yearsmyour son was in Iraq for a yearbefore that, in Kosovo. I get up in the morning, see my wife, who teaches schoolshe'd start earlier than I wouldand she'd be standing there at the sink, drinking her coffee, mouthing a prayer. Every one of you spouses knows what ishappenswhat possibly can happen when your son, daughter, husband, wife are deployed.
Jill and I never forget that military spouses, caregivers, and survivors serve and sacrifice as well. We never forget that you've also answered the Nation's call. And together, Jill and I and my entire administration, has never stopped working to do right by your service. You know, we're with you at thehere at Fort Liberty""All the way""Fort Liberty.
And I tell you what, as a nation, we have many obligations, but we have only one truly sacred obligations. And I used to get criticized years ago, as a young Senator, when I'd say this, but not anymore: Wethe most sacred obligation America has is to prepare those we send into harm's way and care for them and their families when they come home or deploy.
Today we're taking an important step to filltowards fulfilling that obligation. This new Executive order establishes the most comprehensive set of administrative actions in our Nation's history to support the economic security of military families, veterans' spouses, caregivers, and survivors, actions that boil down into three main goals: more flexibility, more support, and more resources.
I'll start with the flexibility piece. This Executive order encourages all Federal agencies to do more to retain military spouses through flexible policies. Policies like granting leave when their partner has to PCS, improving remote work opportunities for military spouses, including when they're stationed overseas.
And it's just common sense to keep families together. It keeps a talented workforce together. And look, it enables our Government to carry out its global mission.
Second, the Executive order means more support for military-connected families. Changing duty stations is already hard enough. You shouldn't have to navigate a complicated tax regulations or work requirements, butall by yourself just to do that. If you're certified in one State and you're military, you should be certified in every other State when you move to that State.
The first time this Executive order will enable spouses to seek advice on overseas employment issues through military legal assistance offices.
It alsoyou also need support to navigate challenges unique to military families. Challenges like juggling childcare and work while your partner is deployed or when you're caring for an injured loved one.
Too oftentoo oftenthe people you work with, they just don't know. Not they don't care; they don't know. They don't know what you're going through. They don't know how it works. They don't understand everything you go through. That can be tough, and it can be even isolating.
That's why this Executive order establishes new training for Federal human resources and hiring personnel to ensure that all our military and veteran spouses, caregivers, and survivors feel seen and supported.
And finally, this Executive order means more resources, especially when it comes to improving military families' access to quality, defendable [dependable; White House correction], and affordableaffordablechildcare.
Today we're accelerating the implementation of the Dependent Care Flexibility Spending Account, which will give military families the option to receive a pretax benefit for daycare, preschool, and summer camps, and much more.
This order also focuses on providing resourcesresourcesfor military spouses who are entrepreneurs, like some of the folks up here on this stage that will be here in a moment. That includes exploring new funding options like grants and loans to help military spouses start and sustain their businesses, and developing new resources that are going to make it easier for entrepreneurs to relocate their businesses if they have to PCS.
Folks, let me close with this: Next month, we'll celebrate 50 years of the All-Volunteer Force. At the time, there was some debate about whether or not we could draw in talentthe talent we needed, about whether Americans would answer the call to serve.
But 50 years on, we see so clearly all of you who raised your handall of you who volunteeredare the reason that our military today is the greatest fighting force in the history of the world, bar none. That's the reason.
And the reasonthe reason we've been able to sustain that force year after year, decade after decade is because military spouses, caregivers, and survivors have answered the call as well. You have your loved ones' backs just like they have the country's back.
So the only waythe only wayto keep this force strong for the next 50 years, and 50 after that and the 50 after that, is if we keep our promisesif we uphold the sacred obligation we bear to our military members, our veterans, our spouses, caregivers, and survivors.
So today I'm here as Commander in Chief to sign this Executive order because it matters. It matters to our military recruitment and retention. It matters to our troops' readiness and resilience. And it matters to our Nation's safety and security.
Supporting our military and veterans' families is not just a moral imperative, it's a national security imperative. And I'm not joking. It is. And that should unite all of us, public and private sectors.
And together, we're going to keep doing everything we can to make sure if you receive the flexibility, support, and resources that you deserve, things are going to get better. That's my promise to you.
And to all military and veteran spouses, caregivers, and survivors, may God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.
Now I'm going to go over and sign this Executive order. And thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you for your service.
[At this point, the President approached the signing desk.]
Who else?
[A baby cried.]
You've got it, kid. [Laughter]
The First Lady. Wow. That's a little baby.
The President. Come on up here.

2023-06-09 00:00:00,"Remarks on Career-Connected Learning and Workforce Training Programs in Rocky Mount, North Carolina","
The President. Hello, hello, hello. Well, thank you all for allowing us to come.
Governor, thank you for allowing us to be here. I think we have everyone on the city council here and the county council and the Congress. Anyway, this is aNorth Carolina is a great State.
And, America, thank you for that introduction. I told America, the hardest thing to do, at least for me, when I was her age was to introduce someone. I think it'sno, I really mean it. And Ianyway, I won't go into all that. But anyway.
Folks, I'm Jill Biden's husband. [Laughter]
And we brought some friends with us today. Governor Roy Cooper, a terrific partner in creating economic opportunity for the people of North Carolina.
Congressman Don Davis used to work in tobacco fields, became an officer in the United States Air Force, a minister, a professor with a doctorate, a Member of the House of Representatives. I don't know what the hell to call himdoctor, minister, reverendI[laughter]but he's got it all. He's got it all. And he's got three sons with him that are going to take care of himall these boys sitting next to him.
And, MayorMayor Roberson, thank you for the passport into the city. I appreciate it very much.
And I want to thank everyone on Rocky Mountain City Council, Nash County, EdgeEdgeexcuse me, Edgecombe County. And they're here today because we believe in youall the students here. We're proud of you, and that's not hyperbole. Great things are ahead of you, and there are a lot of training you're going to be getting.
But you know, Jillmy wife has taught in community college now for some years. And she has her doctorate as a professor there. And she has an expression. She says that, ""You know, community colleges are the best secret in America."" And then she goes on to sayand Ishe's right that ""any country that outeducates us will outcompete us."" Any country that outeducates us will outcompete us.
And we're in an incredible competition worldwide, economically, politically, and militarily. And you know, justthis best kept secret is not being kept secret much anymore. Just in this community collegeand the community colleges, sincein North Carolina since 2021, private investors have invested $16 billion in community collegeprivate investors, $16 billion. That doesn't count the billions of dollars we're investing from the Federal Government and the programs we've had.
The point is, these investments were made in good-paying jobs all across North Carolina, not just here.
Let's remember where we were just a few years ago. When I took office, the community wasthe economy was reeling. We were in tough, tough shape. Unemployment was extremely high. And across the country, the pandemicit hit us very hard. Millions were out of work. And I'm notit's not hyperbole. Millions were out of work.
But the problems we were facing started a lot earlier than that. For decades before the last administrationDemocrat and Republicanthe middle class and working class folksfamilies I come fromwere being hollowed out. Too many good-paying manufacturing jobs were moved overseas. Why? Because of cheaper labor. So we startedinstead of sending product overseas, we sent peopleor jobs overseas, and they'd send product back to us. And factories closing down all over America.
I look at a few guys in the audience, who go back a little bit, may remember what it does when a community has a factory that's working where you had 1,000, 700, or 2,000 people working and all of a sudden it closes down. The community loses its heart. It justit absolutely getsit's devastated. What to do?
How many people in North Carolina, in my home State of Delaware, and around the country have had to walk up to their mom and dad and say: ""Mom, we've got toI got a good high school education, but I've got to leave. There's no jobs. There's nothing here."" Well, guess what? It's coming back. It's coming back big time. [Applause] No, it really is.
And so one of the things that we're talking about here is: What do we do to make us, once again, the most competitive nation in the world? And you know, we're here today because, as Jill said, we believe in y'all. And Ithat's not hyperbole. We believe in y'all.
You know, thewe're in a position where things ahead of you are, thanks to the training you're going to get and investments we've made, going to be good-paying jobs all acrossnot just here in the East, but all across North Carolina, the entire State.
Let's remember who we are.
You know, as I said just a few years ago, we were really in trouble. But the problems we're facing today started, as I said, a lot earlier than that.
You know, the bottom line is this: I ran for PresidentI ran for President for a basic reason. And I hadn't planned on running again for President. I had run when I was Vice President, and then Barack and I spent 8 years together. And then the new administration came in. And in the meantime, things changed in our life and our family. I lost my son. We lost our son in Iraq. Anyway.
I hadn't planned on running. But one of the things that didn't makewhat I really decided was, we stopped paying attention to the neighborhoods that I came from. You know, I come from a neighborhood like maybe a lot of you, in Scranton, Pennsylvania, which closed down because of the mines closed down. And then we moved to a place called Claymont, Delaware, where they had 4,500 steelworkers working in the factories. That shut down completely.
All across the country, we were seeing things change. And I came because I thought we could fundamentally change the direction we were going in, to make sure the economy works for everybody, forto feel a sense of pride in what we do.
You've heard me say it before, but where in the hellwhere in heck is it written[laughter]excuse me. Where is it written that America can't lead the world again in manufacturing? Where is that written? And I was determined to make sure it got unwritten.
Because, folks, look, here's where we are: Just in a few weeks after I became President, I wrote thewe wrote the American Rescue Plan, the most aggressive economic recovery package since Franklin Delano Roosevelt. It delivered immediate relief to folks inmost in need to get our economy back on track.
Next, weI enactedwhich we were told we couldn't doI was told by the press and everyone else that we couldn't do a bipartisan bill. Well, we've invested more money in roads, bridges, internet, and clean water, et ceterathe largest investment in infrastructure since Dwight Eisenhower's Interstate Highway System.
And now we have the best economy in the world. We need the best infrastructure in the world. How can you be the best economy without the best bridges, roads, ports, et cetera?
So, to date, we've invested nearly $5 billion$5 billionin 158 infrastructure projects just in North Carolina$5 billion dollars just in North Carolinaincluding roads, and bridges, and public transit, clean water, high-speed internet. And, folks, it's working.
After I had this idea, wesome on the other team didn't like, but they came along, at least a minority of them didwith a thing called the CHIPS and Science Act. We used to invest 2 percent of our gross domestic product in research and development. We got down to .7 percent. China leading the world, not us.
So we put together thisthe whole program calledthat related to investing in science to bring key parts of our supply chain back to the United States, like semiconductors.
You know, there's 300 semiconductors that go in an automobile. Well, guess what? When theywhen we had a problem with the pandemic in Asiathose places shut downwe had to stop making cars. And the price of carsused cars went up, skyrocketed, andand the biggest reason for inflation.
Now, chip companies are investing billionsbillions of dollarsover $30 billionincluding over in Chatham County, where Wolfspeed invested $5 billion in a semiconductor manufacturing plant. It's going to create 1,800 new jobs that pay an average salary of $77,000 a year.
And these jobs, and the jobs they need at the plantsetting up electric vehicle system, operating machinery, running the facilityare exactly the kind of jobs you're being trained for here at this community college.
Then we passedwhich wasdidn't get much help from the other teamthe Inflation Reduction Act, the most significant climate legislation ever in the history of not just America, but the whole world. Over $368 billion for energy.
And here's what happened: Companies are seizing the opportunity. For example, Toyota is investing $6 billion in a new plant over in Liberty, building lithium batteries for electric and hybrid vehicles, creating 2,100 new jobs, good-paying jobs.
All told[applause]. All told, we've attracted 470 billionalmost a half a trillion dollarsin private investment all across the country, including $16 billion right here in North Carolina. Private investment, not the Government. Private investment.
And here are the results: We've created nearly 400,000 jobs in North Carolina. Remember, Gov, when we were first starting together, we were losing jobs. We were hemorrhaging jobs here. We've created 400,000 jobs in North Carolina.
And hereand by the way, we've now, in 2 years, created 13.4 million new jobs. More jobs in 2 years than any President has created in 4 years. Nearly 800,000 manufacturing jobs, brandnew. Eight hundred thousand.
Manufacturing is back. We want to make sure these jobsthese jobsthat give workers free and fair choice, by the way, to join a union if they wish to do that. And I want to make sureI want to make sure the skilled workers are ready to fit these jobs.
Look, you can't have advanced manufacturing without a highly trained workforce. They don't go together. That's where you all come in.
Here at this college, you're learning every aspect of advanced manufacturing, machining, and robotics, so you can make everything from cell phones to rocket ships, literally, not figuratively. Electric systems so you can build everything from electric vehicle parts to the assembly lines they're carried on. Automated packaging to ship goods and quickly and safely all around the world.
Ninety-five percent of the students who study advanced manufacturing at this college get jobs right after graduation. And you know, like Jill said, community colleges are the best kept secret in America. For the longest time, no one wanted to talk about it. Every time I'd raise it for the last 12, 14 years, they'd say, ""Ehh, you know, ehh""well, here at Nash, you can see why it's important. And nownowwe want to build on all that, what you're doing here, all across America.
We've invested a half a billion dollars in what we call the Good Jobs Challenge. Now, that's the goal to create good training jobs all across the country in the industries of the future like clean energy.
Here in North Carolina, you accepted that challenge. Led by the Governor, with a group called the North Carolina Business Committee for Education and North Carolina A&T, which graduates more Black engineers than any other institution in America, by the way. And we provided billions of dollars for HBCUs as well, which is another story.
But we've created a coalition of community colleges, partners, including the IBEWmore than 40 employersdifferent employers. These employers committed to hire at leastat least3,000 trainees to build solar panels, electric batteries, and clean energy technology.
And, folks, the benefit of that is, you're not only getting a good-paying job, you're going to be doing something to help save your country. Notno kidding.
Anybodyyou know, I have a lot of folks I came to work with in thewhen I was President who thinks there's no such thing as global warming. Anybody doubt it? [Laughter]
I have literally, as President of the United States, flown over more territory where woods have beenforests have been burned to the ground, from New Mexico all the way up to Washington State and Montana, that equals the size of the entire State of Maryland. That's how much has been burned to the ground.
And we're building moremore partnerships likein places like Phoenix, Arizona; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. We're investing in America Workforce Hubs all across America. Look, Jill launched one just a few weeks ago.
Folks, I guess what I'm trying to say is, I think that it's important when you have a job that not only your work conditions and your salary and your benefits reflect how you're treated with dignity, but where you really feel like you're doing something that matters. What you're doing is going to matter to people; it's going to matter to your country.
If we don't deal with global warmingit's the only existential threat that exists for humanity. All of the data shows that if we don't stay between 1.5 degrees Celsius by the year 20anyway, we're going to be in trouble.
Here's the bottom line: A manufacturing and innovation boom is happening all across America, not just in North Carolina. But the support of people like Roy Cooper and Don Davis, with the leadership of community colleges like yours.
Back in 1964, President JohnsonLyndon Baines Johnson came to Rocky Mountain [Mount; White House correction] and spoke, and here's what he said. He said, ""The time has come for us to see that every American gets a decent break and a fair chance to make good."" That's exactly what we're working to achieve. That's what this is about.
I'm so sick and tired of my whole career of what they used to call trickle-down economics: If the folks at the top do well, everybody does well.
My dad was a hard-working guy who busted his neck. We livedwe weren't poor. We lived a middle class life: four kids in a three-bedroom home with a grandpop living with us. Andbut the point wasit was in a decent, fair neighborhood, and we were just like everybody elsebut I never saw any of that economic benefit trickle down on my dad's kitchen table.
So I decidednot a jokeand you'reyou're going make me a prophetand that is that we're going to build this economy from the middle out and the bottom up. When that happens, everybody does well. The wealthy still do very well.
I'm a capitalist. If you can go out and make a billion dollars, have at it, man. Just pay your fair share of taxes.
Audience member. Yeah, pay your taxes.
The President. So, look, we've made a lot of progress. Now we've got to keep it going. We just have to remember who we are. For God's sake, we're the United States of America.
This is not hyperbole: There's never been a thing we've set our mind to as a countrynever been a single major initiative we've set our mind to as a country and we've worked together, we haven't accomplished it. It's time to remember who we are: We're the United States of America.
So, look, let's get together and move this. And I promise you, you're going toyou're not going to remember who the hell said this to you, but 15 years from now when this State is in even better shape than it is now and continuing to grow, and we're the epicenter of economic growth in the world, you're going to say, ""I think I heard somebody say that."" But it's because of you, when it happens. It really is.
There's nothing, nothing, nothing beyond our capacity. And there's nothing beyond your capacity. You just have to believe and be given half a chance.
I'm so damn proud to be with you all. So thank you very much.
And, Gov, thank you for what you put together in this State. I think you're the best Governor in the country, but thank you.

Joseph R. Biden, Remarks on Career-Connected Learning and Workforce Training Programs in Rocky Mount, North Carolina Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/363187 "
2023-06-08 00:00:00,The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Rishi Sunak of the United Kingdom,"
President Biden. Well, good afternoon. Please have aplease be seated.
I'd like to start, with the permission of my British friends, to just say a few words about the wildfires in Canada and the quality of the air here in the East Coast that's blanketed the communities in the East Coast and the smoke this past few days.
I just put out a more detailed statement, sofor the press and for the people to see. But I spoke yesterday with Prime Minister Trudeau, and I've decidedI dictated a National Interagency Fire Center response to Canada's request for additional firefighters and the fire suppression assets, such as airtankers.
We already have 600 American firefighters on the ground that have been there for a while in Canada, including Hotshots and the Smokejumper crews.
And it's very important that affected communities listen to the guidance of their State and local officials from this point forward. To keep up to date on the air quality in real time, go to the app that we provided. It's called airnow.gov. And check on one another.
And by the way, what you'll get is something that looks like this
[At this point, the President held up a graphic.]
with a calibrated piece that says when the air is clean and when the air is dangerous and hazardous. And it dictates whatwill tell you the air quality in yourin the neighborhood.
Now, it's my honormy honor to welcome Prime Minister Sunak to the White House.
Rishi, we'veyou're probably tired of meeting. We met in March in[laughter]in San Diego to discuss AUKUS andwith the Prime Minister of Australia. In April, we were there for the 25th Anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement in Belfast. We met and discussed again today the need to get the Stormont institution in Northern Ireland up and running.
Last month, together with our G-7 partners in Hiroshima, we drove progress on everything from our shared support for the brave people of Ukraine to the common principles of engaging with China.
Today, in Washington, we have had important and positive discussions to deepen our bilateral economic relationship and expand our cooperation to shape the challenges and future for thisremainder of this century.
It's a testament to the depth, breadth, and, I would argue, the intensity of our cooperation and coordination, which has existedcontinues to exist between the United Kingdom and the United States. There's no issue of globalof importance, none, thatwhere our nations are not leading together and where we're not sharing our common values to make things better.
In our conversations today, we continued to build on all that we've achieved over these past months. We discussed how we can continue to adapt and upgrade our partnership to ensure our countries remain at the cutting edge of a rapidly changing world.
Our economic partnership is an enormous strength and source of strength that anchors everything that we do together. And we want to harness that power to make sure we're creating good jobs and supporting working class families in both our countries and that growth is shared broadly and no one gets left behind.
So today we're releasing a new plan to equip our economic partnership for the 21st century. It outlines how we can enhance our cooperation to accelerate the clean energy transition that must take place and is taking place, lead the development ofonof emerging technologies that are going to shape so much of our future, and protect technologies critical to our national security.
And a key piece of that is working together to strengthen our critical mineral supply chains and to make them more resilient so we're not dependent on any one country to meet our goals.
When it camewhen it comes to technology that will shape the futurelike semiconductors, quantum computing, artificial intelligencethe U.K. and the U.S. are working together to make sure they are developed safely and responsibly and jointly.
We're going to do more on joint research and development to ensure the future we're building remains fundamentally aligned with our value set in both our countries.
And we're doing more to prevent technologies that are invented and developed in our countries from being used for military or intelligence purposes by countries that do not share our values.
Today we'realso discussed our unwavering support for the people of Ukraine and defendwho are defending themselves against the most brutal aggression we've seen in a long time, at the hands of Russia and Putin.
The U.K. and the United States, together with more than 50 partners, have committed historic levels of security assistance to Ukraine. And I want to thank the Prime Minister for his strong, strong leadership, contributing significant amounts of security assistance and training Ukrainian troops so they can effectively use the equipment and ammunition we've collectively provided them, and in bringing the world together later this month to drive support for Ukraine's long-term economic recovery.
You're doing a great deal.
So, Mr. Prime Minister, I thank you for making the journey to Washington.
Earlier this week, we marked the 79th anniversary of D-Day, anda timely reminder of the proud history ofour nations share and the valuesthe valuesthat we have long stood together to defend.
That's the unshakable foundation of this special relationship. And it is a special relationship. There's no country closer to us than Great Britain.
Today, as NATO allies, partners in innovation, as friends in a shared vision of the future, and the two nationsour two nations are ready to meet the challenges of our time and meet them together. And I'm confident the United Kingdom and the United States will continue to lead the world toward greater peace, prosperity, and security for all.
So thank you again, Mr. Prime Minister. And the floor is yours.
Prime Minister Sunak. Thank you, Mr. President. And before I begin my remarks, a word, if I may, on what happened in France this morning.
All our thoughts are with those affected by this unfathomable attack, including a British child, and with their families. I've been in touch with President Macron. We stand ready to offer any assistance that we can.
Mr. President, Joe, it is an honor to be here at the White House, and thank you for your very warm welcome.
Not for decades has the relationship between our two nations been so important. The values we share, our belief in freedom, democracy, and the rule of law have never changed. They never will.
But what has changed are the challenges that we face. And standing here together, as our predecessors have done for generations, I feel confident that through the strength of our relationship, we can shape the world once again in our pursuit of liberty, prosperity, and the possibilities of a new age.
And that begins with our highest priority: national security. Last time I was here in the U.S., we signed AUKUS, the most significant defense partnership in generations, because we recognize that the security of the Atlantic and Pacific regions are indivisible.
And just a fortnight ago, in Hiroshima, President Biden and I stood with President Zelenskyy and our G-7 allies in a powerful display of unity. The U.K. is proud of our contribution, including providing tanks, long-range weapons, and training Ukrainian soldiers.
But let no one doubt U.S. leadership and resources are the decisive contribution allowing the forces of democracy and freedom to prevail. As I said in Congress, and I say again now to President Biden and to the American people: Thank you.
And just as we collaborate to protect our national security, so must we increasingly do the same to protect our economic security on which our prosperity depends.
Countries like China and Russia are willing to manipulate and exploit our openness, steal our intellectual property, use technology for authoritarian ends, or withdraw crucial resources like energy. They will not succeed.
Today we have agreed the Atlantic Declaration, a new economic partnership for a new age, of a kind that has never been agreed before. Yes, a partnership that protects our citizens, but more than that, a test case for the kind of reimagined alliances President Biden has spoken so eloquently about.
And that means new investment. This week alone, 14 billion of new American investment has been committed into the U.K., creating thousands of jobs. It means stronger supply chains with a new action plan on clean energy. And it means reducing trade barriers in the technologies of the future with a new secure U.K.-U.S. data bridge, helping tens of thousands of small businesses. An agreement to work towards mutual recognition of more professional qualifications in areas like engineering.
And we're launching negotiations on a new critical minerals agreement. Once concluded, this will give U.K. companies stronger access to the U.S. market.
And we're building on our extraordinary shared strengths in cutting-edge future technologies, with joint research collaborations in areas like quantum, semiconductors, and AI.
Now, our job as leaders is to ensure that this technological revolution makes us more secure and not less. Last week, the pioneers of artificial intelligence warned us about the scale of the challenge, as well as the opportunity. The U.S. and the U.K. are the world's foremost democratic AI powers. So today President and I agreed to work together on AI safety, including multilaterally.
Now, the U.K. looks forward to hosting the first global summit on AI safety later this year so that we can seize the extraordinary possibilities of this new technological age and do so with confidence. And we are well placed to do so.
I know some people have wondered what kind of partner Britain would be after we left the EU. I'd say: Judge us by our actions. We're committed to our values as ever, as reliable an ally as ever, as attractive an investment destination as ever.
But we're changing too. We're strengthening our relationships, not just with old friends like America or in Europe, but with new friends in the Indo-Pacific too. And we now have the freedom to regulate the new technologies that will shape our economic future, like AI, more quickly and flexibly. That is the future that we are creating in Britain: confident, proud, and free.
And let me close with a personal reflection. As Joe mentioned, he and I have seen quite a lot of each other in recent months. I gather our wives have even started to take spin classes together. [Laughter] And we were talking earlier about our hometowns. Joe is very rightly proud of Scranton. And I was telling him a little bit about Southampton, in England, where I'm from.
Now, not everyone knows this, but it was in a church in Southampton, where in the days before he set sail for these shores, that John Winthrop first spoke about his dream of building ""a city on a hill."" And that reminds us that the relationship between our two nations is unlike any other. Our alliance is so strong because it is not abstract. It is rooted in our people. And it's never been about our history alone, but about our ability to grasp the future.
We share the same beliefs, pursue the same purpose, and act according to the same ideals. And that's why today, as we meet the challenges of our time, we can depend on each other with absolute conviction.
When the United States and the United Kingdom stand together, the world is a safer, better, and more prosperous place. And that's why ours is the indispensable alliance.
Thank you.
President Biden. Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister.
All right. First question goes to James [James Politi] of the Financial Times. Unless he left.
U.S. Assistance to Ukraine/International Assistance 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate the question. Withyou spoke about your unwavering support for the people of Ukraine. So much of that depends on funding from the U.S. Congress. And now with the counteroffensive underway, when do you expect to return to Congress and ask for new funding? And how much do you expect you will need? And do you think that Speaker McCarthy will agree to it, given some skeptical comments that we heard earlier this week?
President Biden. No, not sure, and yes. [Laughter]
Q. And to Prime Minister Sunak, you spoke earlier this week about the importance of finding long-term security arrangements and agreements for the defense of Ukraine for many years ahead. Do you think thathave you found a common position with President Biden on that issue? What's your preferred model for a long-term security agreement with respect to Ukraine? And does it need to be sorted out before the Vilnius summit?
Thank you.
President Biden. Let me begin by answering your question. First of all, the Ukrainians should speak to the military operations; I won't do that from here. We've done everything we could collectively, but individually in the United States, to make them ready, to support that it willthat it's going to continue, and an evolving situation that we'rewhere we're very optimistic.
In talks with the Ukraineand Ukrainians and particularly with Zelenskyy and our allies and partners, on commitments to Ukraine, long-term securitylong-term security to deter future aggression after this war ends is the goal. And we're advancing this goal by providing them the support Ukraine needs now on the battlefield and helping them strengthen their military over the long term.
The fact of the matter is that I believe we'll have the funding necessary to support Ukraine as long as it takes. And I believe that we're going tothat that support will be real, even though there areyou hear some voices today on Capitol Hill about whether or not we should continue to support Ukraine and for how long we should support them.
The fact of the matter is, I ask people to picture what would happen if we were not supporting Ukraine. Do we think Russia would stop in Kyiv? Do you think that's all there would be happening? I think not, and I think the vast majority of my colleagues, even the critics, think that would not be the case as well.
There's much more to say about Ukraine, but I hope that answers your direct question.
Prime Minister Sunak. James, thank you for the question. If I might actually touch on your first question first.
And so it's actually entirely reasonable for the American people to hear what I say and, hopefully, acknowledge the thanks that we have for their support of the situation in Ukraine, but also ask if everyone is doing their bit. And that's why, as I said, the U.K. is proud to be, behind the U.S., the biggest contributor to the military effort in Ukraine.
And I think it's right that other countries also step up and do their part. We're lucky to have America's investment in European security, but we need to share the burden alongside you, which is why defense spending in the U.K. haswasbeen above the 2 percent NATO benchmark. It's on an increasing trajectory, and we would encourage other countries to follow the lead that the U.S. and the U.K. set, because our security is collective.
I think the other thing for you to know about us as an ally is, we also view security as indivisible between the Euro-Atlantic region and the Pacific. That's why the AUKUS partnership is so important. That's why we're strengthening our engagement and alliances in that region too so that the U.S. can count on the U.K. as a partner and an ally, sharing the burden, but also working together in every sphere that it matters.
And on your latter question, I agree with what the President said: It's about deterrence. President Putin will be thinking that he can wait us out, that the alliance will tire, we'll get fatigued, and we'll give up.
Now, that is not the case. And the more we can put in place support for Ukrainenot just in the here and now, but support that will last for a time and for years to comeI think it sends a strong signal to him that there is no point in trying to wait us out. We're not going anywhere. We will be here for as long as it takes. And hopefully, that will speed up the calculation in his mind that he should withdraw his forces and stop what is an illegal and unprovoked act of aggression.
President Biden. Also, if you don't mind my making an addendum, I'd point out that not only do we have Europe respondingI spent a lot of time in Japanthe Japanese have stepped up. They've stepped up in terms of their budget. They've stepped up in terms of their involvement. They've stepped instepped up in terms of their support for Ukraine, realizing that an advancea glaring invasion, with no pretext by anything other than conquering land, occurring in the 21st century is a danger not only in Europe but everywhere in the world.
The next question from the PBS NewsHour. Laura.
Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Rights 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President.
President Biden. I think you're going to steal the mike. That's why they're
Q. [Laughter] Yes, they're holding on to it.
Laura Barrn-Lpez with the PBS NewsHour. All over the country, Mr. President, Republican-led States are passing lawspassing anti-LGBTQ, antitransgender laws that restrict rights and medical care. Intimidation is on the rise. This week, anti-LGBTQ protesters turned violent in California.
And also, recently, I spoke to the parents of a transgender girl in Texas who told me that they're afraid and that they are considering leaving not just their State, but the country.
Sir, why do you think this is happening? And what do you say to parents, like the ones that I spoke to, to those families who are contemplating leaving the country because they don't feel safe anymore?
And then, PrimePrime Minister Sunak, thank you. You mentioned that AI has been a key part of your visit. What are the U.S. and the U.K.what is the U.K. doing with the U.S. to protect elections and democracy from AI-generated disinformation campaigns waged at scale by foreign actors?
And you also mentioned the warning letter sent by AI leaders about the potential threat that this technology, if misused, can pose to humanity. How is regulating artificial intelligence going to be any different than what has been done at the global scale, so far, to deal with climate change, another existential threat?
President Biden. Let me answer your first question. First of all, maybe quietly, when we finish this, you can give me the number of that family, and I will call them and let them know that the President and this administration has their back. And I mean that.
Look, as President, I was proud to end the ban on transgender troops in our military, sign the Respect for Marriage Act, strengthen the civil rights protections for LBGT Americans, and advance LGBT human rights around the globe.
But our fight is far, far from over because we have some hysterical and, I would argue, prejudiced people who are engaged in all of what you see going on around the country. It's an appeal to fear, and it's an appeal that is totally, thoroughly unjustified and ugly.
It's wrong forthat a person can be married in the morning in the United States and fired in the afternoon by their employer because they arethey're gay. It's wrong that the violence and hate crimes targeting LGBTQ people is rising. It's wrong that extreme officials are pushing hateful bills targeting transgender children, terrifying families, and criminalizing doctors.
These are our kids. These are our neighbors. It's cruel and it's callous. Not somebody else's kids; they're all our kids. They're the kidsand our children are the kite strings that hold our national ambitions aloft. It matters a great deal how we treat everyone in this country.
And the fact is that I'm announcing today a series of new initiatives that we're taking to protect the LGBT community. I was going to do this at the fore out on South Lawn. We're having Pride Day, but we're going to have to postpone it because of the climate, because of the weather and the pollution out there because of the fires.
But number one, we're going to strengthen the physical safety, dedicated resources, the Federal coordination to better protect Pride celebrations, marches, community centers, health care providers, and small businesses.
Secondly, we're addressing civil rights violations, a new coordinator to protect LGBT students from book bans, which make it harder for kids to learn and may violate their civil rights at the same time.
We're also engaging in mental health and other supports, more mental health resources and funding to help families support their kids, new efforts to protect LGBTQ kids in foster care, and steps to endthe absolute end of LGBTQ homelessness.
Congress has to passand I'm not giving up on this. Just like they told me we couldn't get Marriage Act passed. Congress must passmust passthe Equality Act and send it to my desk.
LGBTQ Americans, especially children: You're loved, you're heard, and this administration has your back, and I mean it. We are not relenting one single second to make sure that they're protected.
Prime Minister Sunak. Laura, theon your question, it's clear that AI can bring incredible and will bring incredible benefits to society, our economies, to all of us. And actually, one of your leading venture capitalists just published an essay on this, which made the point very eloquently yesterday.
And it's also clear, though, that it does pose very real risks that we, as leaders, need to be cognizant of and put in place the guardrails to mitigate against.
Actually, President Biden and I had a very good conversation on this just a couple of weeks ago in Japan in one of our sessions in Hiroshima. And we are aligned in wanting to discuss with other countries what those guardrails should be.
I think here in the U.S., you've convened all the companies together recently; we've done the same in Downing Street just a couple of weeks ago. And I think there are a series of measures that we can implement working cooperatively, as we have been discussing, that will ensure that we can enjoy the benefits of this technology whilst mitigating against their risks. And that's what our citizens would expect.
And you talk about climate change. You know, we come together at COP to work multilaterally across multiple countries to bring down carbon emissions, to get funding to the countries that need it, to share research on how we can develop the green technologies of the future. Indeed, that's part of our conversations and agreement today.
And we need to bring that same spirit of urgency, I think, to the challenges and opportunities that AI poses, because the pace of the technological change is faster than people had anticipated. And I think the letter that you mentioned kind of reminded us that we do need to work urgently to address this issue. And I'm delighted that Joe and I and others will be doing that with all great haste.
And I think a couple of questions on our end. Could I call on the BBC?
United Kingdom-U.S. Relations/China 
Q. Thank you. Chris Mason from BBC News.
Prime Minister, your aim as the Conservative Party at the last general election was a full free trade deal with America. Isn't the simple truth of what's been announced today an acknowledgement of a failure to do that?
And to the President, why won't you do a full trade agreement with the U.K.? Thank you.
Prime Minister Sunak. Thanks. So if you look at what we've announced today, what it does is respond to the particular opportunities and challenges that we face right now and into the future. And it asked the question: What do we need to do, working together, that can bring most benefit to our citizens as quickly as possible? And our agreement does that. It's a first-of-a-kind agreement that's ambitious in what it seeks to achieve.
I think that I've structured around a couple of different areas. The first is economic security, because the challenges we face are much more economic in natureit's a big subject of our discussions at the G-7 recentlyand the only way we're going to meet those challenges is to work together to strengthen the resilience of our supply chains, to research the technologies of the future together.
And that's what we've announced today, is a partnership that will deepen our cooperation to strengthen the economic security. And that's good for all our citizens at home.
And those risks have intensified in the past couple of years. I think that's very evident. But it also seeks to build prosperity and create jobs in both of our countries.
We've announced billions of pounds of investment into the U.K., which is going to support thousands of jobs. And the agreement that we've struck today will continue to do that. It will support tens of thousands of small businesses in the U.K., removing unnecessary redtape so that they can trade and do business in the U.S. far easier.
And I think those types of specific, targeted measures that will deliver real benefits to people as quickly as possible are the right things for us to be focused on.
But I think be in no doubt, as Joe and I were discussing earlier, the economic relationship between our two countries has never been stronger. The trade is worth hundreds of billions of pounds, or dollars, a year. Over a million of our citizens in each other's countries work in each other's companies. We are one of the largest investors in each other's countries, and that trade is growing at something like 20 percent last year.
So the relationship is strong; it's booming. But our agreement today focuses on the particular challenges, opportunities of the moment we're in. And I think that's the right thing for us both to be focused on.
President Biden. I think we had a really good discussion today about our economic relationship. And we've launched negotiations on critical materials and an agreement to deal with climate crisis.
For example, there is no reason why Great Britain will not play a major role in not only critical materials, but in investing in the United States of America and all of our initiatives relating to the need for critical materials, including battery technology and a whole range of things. Number one.
Number two, cooperating on data and AI. It is in a limitless capacity and possibility. Webut we have to do it with great care, not relative to one another but relative to the issue. Because when I convened the leaders in AI aboutI think there were 13here in the United States, the very architects of thisAIthey're also very concerned about it getting out of hand, and we've got to make sure we're all on the same page.
And we're looking to Great Britain to lead that effort this fall in putting together a proposala group of nations to deal with how do we deal with this. It not only has the potential to cure cancer and many other things that are just beyond our comprehension, but it has the potential to do great damage if it's not controlled.
And so wewe're looking forI'll overstate it: We're looking for watermarks on everything that has to do with""produced by AI"" so we know from whence it comes. But there's a lot we have to do.
And we're also addressing the national security risk posed by certain types of outbound investments. I had a discussion with Xi Jinping in China: Why was I not transferring certain technological capabilities? And I said, very simply, ""Because you're using them for weapons of mass destruction and intelligence intervention."" And I said, ""If we can work out something on that, we'd have a very different relationship.""
So what we're trying to do is figure out how together we can make sure that we have thelet me back up and say it this way: I don't think ever in the history of human endeavor has there been as fundamental potential technological change as is presented by artificial intelligence. It is staggering. It is staggering.
You have some of these leaders in the industry talking about how they're concerned whether a machine will be able to begin to think for itself, not need to be programmed. I mean, it's justI know it sounds like science fiction, but it is close to science fiction, some of the things. It has enormous potential.
And we're looking to Great Britain to help lead that effort, to figure out a way through this. So we're in fulltotal cooperation, because there's no one, no country we have greater faith in being able to negotiate thisnonot negotiate with individuals, negotiate our way through thisthan the Prime Minister. And so we are in lockstep.
White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. Last question.
Prime Minister Sunak. Thank you. Last question is the Times.
North Atlantic Trade Organization (NATO)/United Kingdom-U.S. Relations/National Economy 
Q. Thank you. Chris Smyth from the Times. Prime Minister, you've made clear your support for free trade, but is today's agreement essentially a recognition that in light of COVID, the growing threat of China, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, that the era of unfettered globalization is over? And if so, the U.S. has made clear that it thinks that requires a much more interventionist industrial policy to respond to that. Why do you think that approach is wrong for the U.K.?
And, Mr. President, what do you say to those abroad who say that your new ""Washington consensus"" is simply a fancier way of saying ""America first""? And in light of the warm words just now about U.K.-U.S. defense collaboration, particularly in Ukraine, do you think it's time for the first British NATO Secretary General in two decades?
President Biden. What's the last part of your question? I'm sorry.
Q. Is it time for a British NATO Secretary General?
President Biden. Maybe. That remains to be seen. We're going to have to get a consensus within NATO to see that happen. They have a candidate who's a very qualified individual. But we're going to havewe have a lot of discussion, not between us, but in NATO, to determine what the outcome of that will be.
And with regard to the first part of your question you wanted me to respond to?
Q. It was about: Is the new ""Washington consensus"" that you and your National Security Adviser set out simply another way of saying ""America first,"" which some overseas think it is?
President Biden. Well, look, my economic policy is totally consistent with what I think is in the interest of our NATO allies and our allies around the world.
One of the things that I decided to doand I find that the Wall Street Journaland I'm sure there is someone here from the Wall Street Journal and other publications that are talking about Bidenomics. I didn't realize it wasI had Bidenomics going.
But the bottom line was this: that the fundamental changes taking place in terms of international trade, nobody inat least very few people in United States, and I suspect around the world, knew what a supply chain meant, what they're talking about, the supply chain.
When we found out during the pandemic that the reason why we couldn't build automobiles was because the outfit that we got our semiconductors from in Southeast Asia had shut down because of the pandemic, we realized thatI decided that no longer would we rely on one center of support for any of the things that are needed for our economic growth.
And I made it clear to all our NATO allies and our partners as well that although we were going to generate afor example, an AI capacity hereI mean, excuse me, a semiconductor capacity here in the United States, attracting literally several hundred billion dollars in investment, that that was available to all of our allies, all of our friends. And they're investing as theyas we are and benefiting in a similar way.
The bottom line here for me is that I think that the world is changing in a way that globalization is still real. But the measure of what we used to call in the United States trickle-down economics, where if theif the trickle-down economics resulted in bothin Democratic and Republican administrations for generationsin making sure we found the cheapest labor in the world, sent the product tosent the work to thoseto that neighbor or those neighbors who have the cheapest labor, and they send back their products.
Well, I'm not doing that anymore. We're going to make sure that we, in fact, have a flip of that. We're sending capacityhere in the United States, we're attracting capacity to build here in the United States to send product overseas, not the reverse.
And I know it sounds simplistic, but it's working so far. And it's not going to hurt any of our allies or friends in terms of the trade piece of this. Matter of fact, I'm finding they're benefiting from it as well, because they're engaging in it with us. And at home, they're doing similar things.
So that's why we talked about the need to have relationships in terms of certain materialsthe battery technologiesto share. We rely on Great Britain to produce a lot of that for us.
So it is increasing trade. But right now it looks like it isbecause the United States is doing so incredibly well, it makes it looks like it's only the United States. It's not. It's just a change in direction in terms of how we view generating economic growth.
Prime Minister Sunak. And just to add to that, I'd say I'm absolutely of the view that the United States, this President does not believe in zero-sum competition amongst allies. That's what we declared together with our G-7 partners just a few weeks ago in Hiroshima. This is a President and an administration that is completely attuned to the needs and concerns of its allies on these issues. And you can see that.
Today, as the President said, we are launching negotiations between the U.K. and the U.S. on a critical minerals agreement so that the U.S. can provide us with that interaction and cooperation we need.
And the Atlantic Declaration that we've announced today just talks about strengthening, deepening our cooperation. It's not about looking in and being protection; it's about the exact opposite of that.
And it's about strengthening that cooperation across the full spectrum of economic, technological, and other spheres. And that's what you will see. You'll see that from the President. You'll see it from me. You'll see the U.K. and the U.S. working even more closely together on all the big economic issues of our time, because that's what the moment demands, and that's what our citizens need us to do. And that's what the President and I plan to deliver.
President Biden. And it's not just our citizens. Look, the Global Souththere are going to be a billion people in Africa very shortly. One billion.
At the G-7, it was originally called Build Back Better World, but we were talking aboutthere's a new PPI [PGII; White House correction]anywayan industrial policy that we're all signed on to, to provide the countries in Africa and in the Global South an opportunity to grow, significantly grow, which benefits the United States, benefits Europe, benefits every country.
Because the reverse is true: If we don't figure a way in which these countries can grow and participate and have toand be able to build infrastructureyou know, the Canadianstheexcuse me, the Chinese have a Belt and Road Initiative. Well, the Belt and Road Initiative turns out to be a debt and confiscation program. Not going very far.
But what we're doingand we're going to be doing with our NATO allies, with the G-7is providing opportunities. For example, AngolaIshould be in a position very soon to have the largest solar facility in the world, generating significant amounts of energy. It benefits us, benefits them, brings them into the 21st century in a way that they'd never been before.
We're talking about buildingand I had my team putting together with other countries as wellto build a railroad from the Pacific Oceanfrom the Atlantic Ocean all the way to the Indian Ocean. Never occurred before. Howwe'reour Departments of Agriculture are working with these countries.
So there's a significant amount of cooperation, not to hoard capacity, but to expand capacity to further expand opportunity, because we all benefit from it.
And one thing I've learned is that we are not going to be able to deal with the global warming, which is a consequentialsingle most consequential threat to humanity if we don't do it, unless we engage more together, not fewernot less together.
And so the United States will do what it can do well and invite all of our partners to be part of it if we can.
Thank you.
Prime Minister Sunak. Thank you.

Thank you.

2023-06-08 00:00:00,Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Prime Minister Rishi Sunak of the United Kingdom and an Exchange With Reporters,"
President Biden. Well, Mr. President""Mr. President."" JustI've just demoted you. [Laughter]
Mr. Prime Minister, it's great to have you back. And you know, in the past few months, we've met each other in San Diego, and then we met in Belfast, and we met Hiroshima, and now we're here. And we're going to solve all the problems in the world right in this next 20 minutes.
But you know, Prime Minister Churchill and Roosevelt met here a little over 70 years ago, and they asserted that the strength of the partnership between Great Britain and the United States was the strength of the free world. I still think there's truth to that assertion.
And together, we're providing economic and humanitarian aid and security assistance to Ukraine in their fight against a brutal invasion of the Russians. And we've worked out an arrangement with AUKUS, with Australia, to make the Indian Ocean and that whole area safer and more secure. And you know, we're building on the Good Friday Agreement25 yearsand keep that going. We can talk about that a little bit.
As NATO allies, we're working together to help provide the collective defense of all of us. And we're going to furtherI hope we canwe're going to discuss today plans to further strengthen our economic relationship.
And the global economy is undergoing, I think, the greatest transformation that's occurred since the Industrial Revolution. And something you know a lot about, AI, is going to play a big part in that, and I want to hear your views on that as well.
And we don't have a closer ally than Great Britain. And I'm delighted that you're here.
Prime Minister Sunak. Well, Mr. President, thank you. Thank you for the warm words. But also thank you for welcoming me to the White House and for allowing me to stay in Blair House, which, I've got to say, the spare room in the flat in Number 10 Downing Street doesn't quite compare. So it's been a real privilege.
And, as you said, it's daunting to think of the conversations that our predecessors had in this room when they had to speak of wars that they fought together, peace won together, and incredible change in the lives of our citizens.
And again, for the first time in over half a century, we face a war on the European Continent. And as we've done before, the U.S. and the U.K. have stood together to support Ukraine and stand up for the values of democracy and freedom and make sure that they prevail, as I know we will.
But also, I completely agree with what you said: Our economies are seeing perhaps the biggest transformation since the Industrial Revolution as new technologies provide incredible opportunities, but also give our adversaries more tools for harm.
But one thing I know won't changeI'm confident won't changeis the strength of our partnership and our friendship. And we will put our values front and center, as we've always done, to deliver for the British and American people.
President Biden. Well, if we had time, I'd take you over to the Residence where I live. And when you were over in Blair House, thePresident Truman was there because they were redoing the White House. He put a wholethe Truman Balcony exists now because of Blair House being available. The balconythat second balcony you seethe first balcony you see going up.
So, at any rate, and there's an awful lot of stories that are toldprobably a bunch, apocryphalabout the former Prime Minister liking to take baths up theanyway.
Prime Minister Sunak. Wandering around at 3 in the morning.
President Biden. That's right. [Laughter]
Prime Minister Sunak. Yes, Winston Churchill was botheringbothering Mrs. Roosevelt. Yes. So you won'tdon't worry, you won't see me there at[laughter]
President Biden. All right.
Prime Minister Sunak. bothering you and the First Lady.
President Biden. Anyway, welcome, welcome, welcome.

Thank you, everybody.

2023-06-06 00:00:00,Remarks in a Cabinet Meeting and an Exchange With Reporters,"
The President. All right, well, good afternoon. This could have been the week that a catastrophic default happened, putting millions of people's jobs in jeopardy. But instead, we prevented the default, and our historic recovery continues.
And you know, through a bipartisan agreement here, we proved once again that American democracy can function, and I think it's impossible for it to be able to function unless you can have compromise and consensus. And we got a lot of that done.
And we got another piece of good news on Friday. We learned that our economy produced 339,000 jobs last month. That's up to 13.1 million jobs since we came to office.
And today I'm here with my Cabinet continuing to focus on getting the job done for the American people and continuing to invest in America. ""Invest in America"" is more than just a slogan. We're investing in the American people, in our infrastructure, our manufacturing. We're investing in jobs in everyalmost every community across the country.
And for the first time in a long time, America is actually investing in itself, and it's beginning to pay off.
Today we're going to discuss the progress we're making investing in America and the steps each agency around the table here is taking to build on that progress and finish the job. Because we're not finished yet. We've got more to do.
We'll also review the bipartisan budget agreement signed lastI guess I signed it last Saturday, I think it wasto reduce the deficit by nearly $1 trillion on top of the $1.7 trillion we already reduced in the first 2 years of our administration. And after my predecessorthe last guy thatto sit in this chairhe actually increased the national debt by $8 trillion in 4 years.
And the agreementthisour agreement protects Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and veterans care. And it protects the economic progress, like the $470 billion in that private investment we've attracted to the United States and in the United States in manufacturing, clean energy, and our historic investments into fight climate change.
And it also protects the progress we've made in lowering costs for insulin and other prescription drugs and home energy bills as well.
Our administration, led by the folks in this room, is focused on implementing the laws we've passed and continuing to invest in America. And we're focused on securing our border, combating the climate crisis, and protecting the fundamental rights of Americans.
And one more thing: Just today we've launched a new website. It's called invest.gov. You can go online and find the projects we're delivering on, both the public and private. There's 32,000 investment projects and billions of dollars in private sector projects that arecommunities all across America are already beginning to experience. And we've got a lot of work to do.
I'm going to ask Natalie, quickly, to explain, while you're all here, how it works. We don't have the abilityit's not awe don't have a laptop to type of arrangement here. We're just going to show you. She'll explain the rest of what's going on.
Nat.
White House Deputy Chief of Staff Natalie Quillian. I think you explained it quite well. This shows all of the infrastructure investments on this map. And then if you toggle over, you can see all the private sector investments as well. And then you can go by your State and find what's happening in your community.
The President. You can go byyou can go down to every city, town, anywhere on the map and find out exactly how much has been invested so far, what the investment is for, and how it's going to affect your community. And so people will know. You can check it out and what's going on.
So, anyway, thank you all for making the effort to come in. And I'll see you in a little bit.
[At this point, several reporters began speaking at once.]
Q. Mr. President, what's your message to Russia?
Q. Mr. President, it's June the 6th, it's D-Day, the anniversary of D-Day[inaudible]

2023-06-05 00:00:00,Remarks Honoring the 2023 Super Bowl Champion Kansas City Chiefs,"
The President. Well, welcome to the White House the 2023 Super Bowl champions, the Kansas City Chiefs!
Now, I have to be careful what I say today. I'll explain in just a second. You can smile, man. It's okay. [Laughter]
I married a Philly girl. That explains a lot, doesn't it? [Laughter] Fortunately, she is overseas right now, in the Middle East. [Laughter] She's a rabid Eagles fan, and on the waythe way the game ended, I might be in for a rough night. [Laughter] Jill still doesn't even believe the Eagles player who acknowledged the holding penalty.
But I figure if the Kelce family can make it work with Travis and Jason, the first two brothers to play against each other in the Super Bowl, then I know there's hope forhope for the rest of us.
Please sit down, by the way. Please sit.
It's an honor to be with Super Bowl champs, who include former University of Delaware players. Brett, your GM, was born in Pennsylvania and went to college at the University of Delaware. That's one heck of a combination from where I come from. A wide receiver. [Laughter] Matt, your offensive coordinator, was Delaware's star quarterback, setting 20 school records. And Joey, your wide receivers coach, played the same position in college when Delaware won the national championship in 2003.
The three of you had one of the same coaches that I had, the great Tubby Raymond, who was namedwho wasanyway, he's a hell of a coach. [Laughter] I played freshman football at Delaware and ended up low atI shouldn't say this, but you had to have two-oh to keep going and I had 2.99I mean, a 1.99. And my mother made me quit, but I went back out my junior year to play and my senior year.
And while Tubby was the assistant coach, I played defensive back. And after running the drills in that spring practice, he came over, and he said, ""Biden""you know how he'd kind of
[At this point, the President coughed.]
cough when he talked to you like thissome of them will remember this""you run faster backwards than anyone I've ever seen."" [Laughter] Well, my political opposition thinks the same thing of me. [Laughter]
Look, we've got a lot of Chiefs fans here today, including Kansas Governor Laura Kelly. Laura[applause]. Aww, look at her. There you go. God love you.
And Kansas City, Missouri, Mayor Quinton Lucas. Quinton, how you doing, man? Goodyou are good, man. [Laughter] And by the way, he can still go to his left.
At any rateand several Members of the Congress from Kansas and Missouri are present as well. But allwould you all stand up, all the Members of Congress? I tell you what, man, we don't get a quorum that quickly. [Laughter] Good to see you guys and ladies. Appreciate it very much.
And we also know that we're missing one of the most loyal Chiefs fans there ever was, Norma Hunt, who passed away this weekend. I'd like to suggest a moment of silence.
[A moment of silence was observed.]
You know, Norma was known as the ""First Lady of Football."" She attended everyeverysingle Super Bowl in history, all 57, including the past one, where her Chiefs won. And Jill and I send our condolences to the entire Hunt family, including their son and current CEO Chiefof the Chiefs, Clark Hunt.
The Chiefs not only hold the title again, they're building a dynasty. Super Bowl champs in 2020 and 2023, dominating the league with 64 wins in the last 5 years, the best record in the NFL.
Yet, somehow, last summer, people still counted you guys out. But you kept the faith, you overcame injuries, dominating the regular season 14 and 3. In the playoffs, you beat the Jaguars then the Bengals, averaging last year'sexcuse me, avenging last year's AFC Championship game. And then, with 200 million people watching, yet another thrilling game, you beat the Eagles, becoming the Super Bowl champs again.
You know, it's no surprise. You've got a young quarterback named Patrick. The boy can play, man[laughter]two-time MVP, comeback king, the only player in history with a winning record when down by 10 points or more.
We saw him play with that high ankle sprain, another legendary chapter in the story of one of the greatest quarterbacks of his generation and, I predict, of any generation.
You've also got Travis, one of the greatest tight ends ever.
You've got a young team built from unheralded draft picks that turned into a deep roster of six All-Pros, an explosive offense, and a tough defense.
And then there's Coach Andy Reid. And I was asked by the mayor of Philadelphia to arrest him and take him back to Philly, but I can't do that. [Laughter] Twenty-four seasons, the only head coach in NFL history with at least 100 wins for two different teams. You know, they've called him ""a beacon of offensive brilliance,"" ""a beautiful mind."" Well, the guy who gives full meaning to the word ""coach"" because he makes you believe in yourself.
Most important, as much as these guys know about football, they know about life and how to use their platform to make a difference: speaking out for racial justice, honoring veterans as you do, supporting tutors and mentors for local schools.
This is an organization that emphasizes community service and encourages players to create their own charitable organizations, which many have done. And it matters.
You're showing the power of one of the most elusive things in the world: unity. When people from different backgrounds, each with your own personalities, work together as one team. You play together with a distinct style, in constant motion with a real joy of the game and a love for each other and a great city toyou represent.
And from that unity, you strive to bring out the best in yourselves and each others. In fact, I've heard how even after the wins, Patrick and those players go up to Coach Reid and ask him how we could do better. That's pretty incredible. That's pretty incredible.
For everyone watching, especially our children, that's the power of this team, the power of sports, and, I might add, it's the power of this country. It's the power to remind us who we are as Americans. We're the United States of America, and there is nothingnothingbeyond our capacity when we do it together, like these guys behind me.
Folks, congratulations to the Super Bowl champs, the Kansas City Chiefs. And good luck next season.
And by the way, you've got three coaches whofrom the University of Delawareor played there.
[The President put on his University of Delaware hat.]
I've got my University of Delaware hat on.
God bless Norma Hunt's memory, and God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to turn this over to the team president, Mark Donovan.
Mark.
You can use the handheld, Mark, or you can usethey work as well though.
Kansas City Chiefs President Mark Donovan. Thank you.
The President. Get this out of your way.
Mr. Donovan. Appreciate that, President.
Mr. President, on behalf of the entire Kansas City Chiefs organization, thank you for having us here this afternoon. It is a tremendous honor to be here.
Today our entire organization is mourning the passing of our matriarch. Norma Hunt was an amazing woman. And our hearts, our thoughts, our prayers are with the entire Hunt family.
Norma was a joyful soul. She loved her Chiefs. She was really proud of this team and really proud that they had the opportunity to be here today. I can tell you from personal experience, there was no one better to celebrate a championship with than Norma Hunt. And I know for a fact that she wants us to celebrate today.
So please join me in celebrating Norma and celebrating this great team.
Sixty years ago, Lamar Hunt brought this team to Kansas City. And although this is the third Super Bowl championship team, this is the first Chiefs team to ever visit the White House. And for that reason, we're even more proud to be here representing our organization and our town on this national stage.
I want to thank the Missouri congressional congressor delegation and the Kansas congressional delegation who are here with us today. I'd also like to thank members of the President's team who helped us coordinate all the details of this special, special visit.
The men who stand behind me are just remarkable examples of the American spirit, and not because they won a lot of football games. It's because they exhibited the qualities that lead to success.
First, they worked together. This season was never about one individual. It was about a group of men having each other's back, coming together to accomplish something special.
Second, they'd overcome adversity. From a completely retooled roster with a lot of young players counted on to the injury to our star quarterback, these players persevered all season long.
Third, they believed in themselves. When the media experts and the NFL draftniks said that ""Maybe the Chiefs' run was over"" and ""Maybe the division was just too tough,"" the guys behind me proved the naysayers wrong.
And lastly, we are all particularly proud of how they united our community. As the President said, sports has the power to do that. And we're proud to that they united Chiefs Kingdom, a fan base that has proven their reputation as the most passionate in all of football.
Finally, I have to acknowledge and recognize our amazing leadership team that makes all this possible: our chairman and CEO, Clark Hunt; our general manager, Brett Veach; and the man you'll hear from next, our head coach and a future first-ballot Hall of Famer, Andy Reid.
Kansas City Chiefs Head Coach Andrew W. Reid. I'll tell you what, we're fired up to be here, as a football team.
President Biden, your staff, we thank you from the bottom of our hearts for inviting us to the White House. I mean
[The speaker malfunctioned.]
Quarterback Patrick L. Mahomes II. All right now.
Coach Reid. Everybody good? [Laughter] We're really fired up. [Laughter] We are really fired[laughter]inviting us to the White House for this celebration of a championship. From the tourfrom the tour that we had, to the history here, to the great food, manyou can't forget the great foodto the great food, and to this right herethis celebration: We thank you. It's been 100-percent first class, and we appreciate your hospitality.
To the Hunt family, we're thinking about you. Doggone, we're thinking about you. Hmm.
To the Veaches, we love you. To the Donovans; to our staffthe Kansas City Chief staff; to the coaches and to the players: What a phenomenal job we have been able to put things together this past season.
And what a great challenge it is to present ourselves this next year, like President Obamaor excuse me""President Obama""doggone. [Laughter] Like President Biden said, nobody believed us before. Nobody believed us before. And I'm sure it's going to be that same way this time, and we come out and prove them wrong.
To Chiefs Kingdom and the city of Kansas City, man, we appreciate all the support that you give us. It's week in and week out; it's on the road, it's at home. You're the best fans in the business. We love you. We appreciate you. We sure appreciate our support here too.
And then, again, I'm proud to be the head coach of the Kansas City Chiefs, man. Oof. Doggone. Doggone.
Anyways, listen, it's been a long wait to stand before you. Again, we're fired up. We missed the first one to due to COVID, but we are here strong, men, Kansas City strong.
Thank you.
With that, Travis Kelce and Pat Mahomes are going to take over this stage.

2023-06-05 00:00:00,Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen of Denmark,"
President Biden. All right. [Laughter] Well, welcome. I am delighted to have Madam Prime Minister here today. Great to see you again.
We were just talking about the last time we met. I had the opportunity, which was a great opportunityunrelated to anything having to do with foreign policythatfor her to meet my granddaughters, who are bright young women who are college and law school graduates, who still talk to me about their meeting with the Prime Minister.
Prime Minister Frederiksen. Thank you.
President Biden. And as we all knowwe don't talk often much about itDenmark is one of our greatest allies and most reliable friends, closest friends, and on lockstep in every global issue that we've been engaged in.
And I understand today is Constitution Day.
Prime Minister Frederiksen. Yes, it is. It is.
President Biden. And it'sit reflects the fact that we have the same values. I mean, you know, I always talk about how it's about values, whether a country is organized around a certain set of values, and Constitution Day is not dissimilar than our U.S. Constitution. And the idea that there's a shared commitment to the core values ofthat gives our strength. At least, that's what I believe.
And together, we're working to protect those values, including standing up for the people of Ukraine against the brutal aggression of the Russians.
And we've alsoaddressing the global challenges, from promoting inclusive economic growth and the climate crisis. And I want to thank you for your clean energy transition leadership. I really mean it.
And together with NATO allies, we're taking steps to strengthen our shared security, including finishing our bilateral defense cooperation agreement that we're working on.
And I want to thank you again, Madam Prime Minister, for making the effort to be here. We're anxious to see you.
So, welcome. And the floor is yours.
Prime Minister Frederiksen. Thank you so much, Mr. President. It's really nice to see you again and to be here.
I would like to thank you for your leadership. I mean, from a European perspective, to have a President in U.S. who is committed to the transatlantic alliance has always been extremely important.
But I mean, nowadays, when war has returned to our continent, in Europe, it is so important that our allies and our friends, that we stick together and that we are united. And we have truly been for now 15 months, in Ukraine. We will, of course, continue, from a Danish perspective, our very strong support to Ukraine, but I'm looking forward to work even closer with you on defense and security.
I would also like to thank you for your leadership on the green transition. I mean, you have brought U.S. back to the fight against climate change, and you are doing it in a very interesting way because you don'tyou have high ambitions when it comes to climate change, but at the same time, you insist on making sure that Americans will have a job because of this. So sustainable growth is so important.
So thanks for your leadership, and thanks for welcoming us today.
President Biden. Well, I'm delighted to have you here. Thank you.
Thank you all.

2023-06-02 00:00:00,Address to the Nation on the Passage of Public Debt Limit and Federal Budget Legislation,"
My fellow Americans, when I ran for President, I was told the days of bipartisanship were over and that Democrats and Republicans could no longer work together. But I refused to believe that, because America can never give into that way of thinking.
Look, the only way American democracy can function is through compromise and consensus, and that's what I worked to do as your President, you know, to forge a bipartisan agreement where it's possible and where it's needed.
I've signed more than 350 bipartisan laws thus far in almost 2 years, including a historic law thatrebuilding America so that we can rank number one in the world in infrastructure instead of where we're ranked now, number thirteen in the world.
Another historic law, rebuilding our manufacturing base so that we'll lead the world once again in making semiconductor chips so much moreand so many more and so many sophisticated ones.
And now, a bipartisan budget agreement. This is vital becauseit's because it's essential to the progress we've made over the last few yearsis keeping full faith and credit of the United States of America and passing a budget that continues to grow our economy and reflects our values as a nation.
That's why I'm speaking to you tonight: to report on the crisis averted and what we're doing to protect America's future. Passing this budget agreement was critical. The stakes could not have been higher.
If we had failed to reach an agreement on the budget, there were extreme voices threatening to take America, for the first time in our 247-year history, into default on our national debt. Nothingnothingwould have been more irresponsible. Nothing would have been more catastrophic.
Our economy would have been thrown into recession. Retirement accounts for millions of Americans would have been decimated. Eight million Americans would have lost their jobs.
Default would have beenhave destroyed our Nation's credit rating, which would have made everything from mortgages to car loans to funding for the Government much more expensive. And it would have taken years to climb out of that hole. And America's standing as the most trusted, reliable financial partner in the world would have been shattered.
So it was critical to reach an agreement. And it's very good news for the American people.
No one got everything they wanted, but the American people got what they needed. We averted an economic crisis, an economic collapse. We're cutting spending and bringing the deficits down at the same time. We're protecting important priorities, from Social Security, to Medicare, to Medicaid, to veterans, to our transformational investments in infrastructure and clean energy.
I want to commend SenatorSpeaker McCarthy. You know, he and I, weand our teamswe were able to get along and get things done. We were straightforward with one another, completely honest with one another, and respectful with one another. Both sides operated in good faith. Both sides kept their word.
And I also want to commend other congressional leaders: House Minority Leader Jeffries, Senate Majority Leader Schumer, Senate Minority Leader McConnell. They acted responsibly and put the good of the country ahead of politics.
The final vote in both Chambers was overwhelming, far more bipartisan than anyone thought was possible. So I want to thank the Members of Congress who voted to pass this agreement, which I'm going to sign tomorrow and become the law.
So here's what the deal does. First, it cuts spending. And over the next 10 years, the deficit will be cut by more than $1 trillion. And that will be on top of the record 1.7 trillion$1.7 trillionI already cut the deficit in my first 2 years in office.
And it's clear: We're all on a much more fiscally responsible course than the one I inherited when I took office 4 years ago. When I came to office, the deficit had increased every year the previous 4 years. And nearly $8 trillion was added to the national debt in the last administration.
And now we're turning things around, and that's good for America.
You know, my dad used to have an expression. He said: ""Joey, don't tell me what you value. Show me your budget; I'll tell you what you value."" And that's at the heart of this debate: What do we value?
Protecting seniors. You may remember, during my State of the Union Address there were a spiritedthere was a spirited exchange between me and a few Republicans spontaneously occurring on the floor of the House of Representatives. I was pointing out that, for years, some of them were putting forward proposals to cut Social Security and Medicare.
And some of them that night took exception, and they said very loudly that that wasn't true.
So I asked them on the House that night. I saidasked them a simple question: Will you agree not to cut Social Security and not to cut Medicare? Would they agree to protect these essential programs that are a lifeline for millions of Americans? Programs that these Americans have been paying into every single pay check they've earned since they started working and that provide so much peace of mind.
With the bright lights and cameras on, those few Republicans who were protesting, they agreed. They said they wouldn't cut it. That's how we protected Social Security and Medicare from the beginning and from it being cut, period.
Health care was another priority for mea top priority. I made it clear from the outset I would not agree to any cuts in Medicaid, another essential lifeline for millions of Americans, including children in poverty, the elderly in nursing homes, and Americans living with disabilities.
The Housethe original House Republican proposal would have cut health care for up to 21 million Americans on Medicaid, and I said no. And Medicare [Medicaid; White House correction] was protected and so were millions of people most in need.
Look, I've long believed that the only one truly sacred obligation that the Government has is to prepare those we send into harm's way and care for them and their families when they come home and when they don't come home.
That's why my last budget provided VA hospitals with additional funding for more doctors, nurses, and equipment to accommodate the needs of veterans and more appointments. The House Republican plan would have meant 30 fewer million VA health care visits for our veterans. But we didn't let that happen.
In addition, this bill fully funds the bipartisan PACT Act, the most significant law in decades for veterans exposed to toxic burn pits and for their families. It expands access to those veterans and their families to health care and to disability benefits.
Look, we're investing in America and in our people and in our future. We've created over 13 million new jobs, nearly 800,000 manufacturing jobs. Where is it written that America can't lead the world again in manufacturing? Unemployment is at 3.7 percent. More Americans are working today than ever in the history of this country. And inflation has dropped 10 straight months in a row.
In this debate, I refused to put what was responsible for all this economic progress on the chopping block. This bipartisan agreement protects the law that will help us build the best infrastructure in the world.
It fully protects the CHIPS and Science Act, which is going to bring key parts of our supply chain to America so we don't have to rely on otherslike semiconductors, those tiny computer chips smaller than the tip of your finger that affect nearly everything we rely on, from cell phones to havingbuilding automobiles, to the most sophisticated weapons systems, and so much more.
We protected another law that I passed and signed last year that finally beat Big Pharma, which I've been trying to do for over 30 years. It finally gives Medicare the power to negotiate lower drug prices, just like the VA has been able to do for veterans. This law has already dramatically cut the cost of insulin for seniors from as much as $400 a month to just $35 a month for insulin.
Negotiating lower drug prices not only saves seniors a lot of money, it saves the country a lot of money, $160 billion that is not having to be paid out, because we have drug prices that are more rational. We pay the highest drug prices of any industrial nation in the world.
And it's just the beginning. You know, we also protected the most significant breakthrough evereverin dealing with the existential threat of climate change.
Today, new wind and solar power is cheaper than fossil fuel. Since I've been in office, clean energy and advanced manufacturing have brought in $470 billion in private investments. That's going to create thousands of jobsgood-paying jobsall across this country and help the environment at the same time.
And remember, at the beginning of this debate, some of my Republican colleagues were determined to gut the clean energy investments. And I said no, and we kept them all.
And there's oneand there's so much more to do. We're going to do even more to reduce the deficit. We need to control spending if we're going to do that. But we also have to raise revenue and go after tax cheats and make sure everybody is paying their fair share.
No oneI promise no onemaking less than $400,000 a year will pay a penny more in Federal taxes. But like most of you at home, I know the Federal tax system isn't fair. That's why I kept my commitment, again, that no one earning less than $400,000 a year will pay a penny more in Federal taxes.
That's why last year I secured more funding to gomore IRS funding to go after wealthy tax cheats. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Officeand it is nonpartisansays that this bill will bring in $150 billion, and other outside experts expect that it would save as much as $400 billion, because it's forcing people to pay their fair share. Republicans may not like it, but I'm going to make sure the wealthy pay their fair share.
I'm alsoproposed closing over a dozen special interest tax loopholes for Big Oil, crypto traders, hedge fund billionairessaving taxpayers billions of dollars. RepublicansRepublicansdefended every single one of these special interest loopholes. Every single one. But I'm going to be coming back. And with your help, I'm going to win.
Right nowcatch this: Right now the average billionaire in America pays just 8 percent in Federal taxes. Eight percent. Teachers and firefighters pay more than that. That's why I proposed a minimum tax for billionaires. Republicans are against it, but I'm going to keep fighting for it. No billionaire should pay less in Federal taxes than a teacher or firefighter.
Look, let me close with this. I know bipartisanship is hard and unity is hard, but we can never stop trying, because in moments like this onethe ones we just faced, where the American economy and the world economy is at risk of collapsingthere is no other way.
No matter how tough our politics gets, we need to see each other asnot as adversaries, but as fellow Americans. Treat each other with dignity and respect. To join forces as Americans to stop shouting, lower the temperature, and work together to pursue progress, secure prosperity, and keep the promise of America for everybody.
As I've said in my Inaugural Address, without unity there is no peace, only bitterness and fury. And we can never become that country.
I can honestly sayI can honestly say to you tonightthat I've never been more optimistic about America's future. We just need to remember who we are. We are the United States of America, and there's nothingnothingwe can't do when we do it together.
So thank you all for listening, taking the time tonight to listen to me.
May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you.

2023-06-01 00:00:00,"Commencement Address at the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado","
The President. Well, hello, Falcons!
Audience members. Hello!
The President. Big day!
It's great to be back at the Air Force Academy, at the altitude of 7,258 feet above sea levelfar, far above that of West Point or Annapolis. [Laughter]
I figured I should say that so my Air Force One pilots, Colonel Kirkland, class of 1999, and Colonel Donnelly, class of '01, make sure they are willing to take me back to DC. [Laughter] I also brought with me today my Air Force and Space Force Military Aides, Lieutenant Colonel Jon Roe, class of '07, Lieutenant Colonel Ann Hughes, class of '08.
These officers travel the world with me, demonstratingand I mean this sincerelydemonstrating the values of this institution every single day. It's no exaggeration to say I trust my life through Academy graduates. And some of my team members have trusted their lives through academy cadets.
A few months ago, I called to speak to my National Security Adviser, who was out here. But I was told he was unavailable. Turns out, Firstie Andrew Dever had him out doing loops and barrel rolls in a glider. I asked if I could do that today. And the Secret Service said, ""No, we'll have to shoot it down."" [Laughter]
Look, thank you, Colonel ClarkLieutenant ColonelLieutenant General Clark, and to all the faculty and staff here at the Academy for your dedication and commitment in shaping the next generation of American air power and space power.
And thank you to all the parents and families and sponsor families out there in the stands. You've supported these cadets throughout their lives. You taught them how to stand up, never bow, never bend, never yield. You inspired them to put integrity first, to choose service over selfit sounds like hyperbole, but it's literally what you didto pursue excellence in all they do. But I know you're bursting with pride at what they've already accomplished.
So, graduates, give your families a round of applause. Stand up and give them a round of applause. Show them your appreciation. I think they're excited.
Audience member. We love you[inaudible]!
The President. The only thing your moms and dads are saying is, ""I wish I could have paid for this education."" [Laughter] Every other graduation I doand I've done somea lot of graduationscollege graduationsI usually say: ""Parents, today you all get a pay raise. No more tuition.""
But, Secretary Kendall, General Brown, General Saltzman, thank you for leading our Air Force and our Space Force to take on the missions that most mattermost matterfor today and the future so we can continue to maintain air and space superiority just as we have in every U.S. conflict in this century.
But, graduates, you're not just commissioning into the Air Force and the Space Force, you are commissioning into a Joint Force. One thing working more closely together across the service branches than ever before in new ways to deter, if necessary, defeat every threat to our Nation.
Last week, I was proudand I mean it sincerelyto nominate your Air Force Chief, General C.Q. Brown, Jr., the next Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Stand up, General. General, our country thanks you. And I look forward to working with you as Chairman.
And these graduates will have the additional pride of starting their careers of service led by, General that might say, a butt-kicking American airman. I think you used that phrase. [Laughter]
Class of 2023
Audience members. Thor!
The President. All right, man. You'd better.
This is a day you've worked hard to reach. Think back to that first day of Basic when the bus dropped you off at the Footprints. You didn't know what the hell would lie ahead. Maybe you were wondering what exactly you'd gotten yourself into.
And then, after a few days of acclimating, getting yelled at nonstop by your cadre, hearing those words that meant it would only get worsequote, ""PT ban has been lifted."" [Laughter] As if that's a good thing, right? [Laughter] ""The PT ban has been lifted."" [Laughter]
Marching down to Jack's, building tent city, even sweeping the dirt to make it look like there were hallways. You know, before making it past the Assault Course Fall and Assault Course NunezNuez. And I tell you whatyou're all crazy. But at any rate[laughter]no, I'm only kidding.
Rememberrememberthe pride you felt joining the Flying Wedge in the T-Zo, the first time during the Acceptance Day parade, only to face an even more difficult challenge when the schoolyear began: academics.
It wasn't all pushups and cramming for prog week, though to set the Guinness Book of RecordsWorld Recordsmost simultaneous pushupsthere had to be an enormous amount of pushups.
Beyond you, beyondbut all of youI think you had some fun along the way. Maybe a good use of your Epic Passes. [Laughter] That would be reason enough to join. [Laughter] Had a few steaks and tortellini dinners to celebrate commitment and job drops.
I got to see some of you at the White House a few weeks ago to celebrate winning the Commander in Chief Trophy for the 21st time.
When I was graduating from high school 300 years ago[laughter]I applied to the Naval Academy. And I was picked by the Senatorthere's two ways Senators can pick. You can pick individually, or they can name 10 people and let the Academy choose. And I was a relatively good football player, so I had a shot.
And I remember the day that a guy name Steve Dunning, from my class, was also nominated. We drove up. It was about 7 in the morning. We were going to drive down to Annapolis. And I had just heard the night before: They had a halfback named Joe Bellino, won the Heisman Trophy, and a quarterback named Roger Staubach. I went to Delaware. [Laughter]
The Blue Horizons rocketry team managed to send the Superintendent's flight cap all the way to space. [Laughter] I don't know whether he knew it or not, buteven more impressive, you got it back, some 70 miles away.
Of course, there may also have been achievements of less sterling nature. Maybe you had to do a few tours. Maybe you're one of the cadets who decided to enjoy the view from the top of the Chapel in the Box.
So, before I forget, since I was at one of those schools, at a State university, I found myself in a little bit of trouble a couple times. I really wish that a Commander in Chief had spoken at my graduation, because I have the power to hereby waive any confinements and restrictions of minor cadet disciplinary systems violations. They're waived. And, manI wish that my commencement speaker had that power.
Look[laughter]after 4 long years, you pushed to the limits and forged into leaders of character. And after finally getting to jump into the fountain, you commission as a Second Lieutenant of the United States Air Force and the United States Space Force, part of the greatestand this is not hyperboleyou're part of the greatest fighting force in the history of the world.
That is the truth. That's the God's truth. That's not an exaggeration. We have the finest military in the history of the world.
And you have earned it. And this day is the day to celebrate. And as your Commander in Chief, I'm honored to be here as you take on the duties of serving and defending our Nation.
In the years to come, you'll have even more asked of you. You'll take on greater responsibilities, and you'll be challenged even beyond everything you've yet experienced.
But you have those mountains. You leave them as you lookI'm sure you're going to be thinking about this a lot as you're moving through your careers. As you leave these mountains where the air is rare, you're going to take with you the confidence that your years have prepared you for whatever is ahead.
After all, your time at this proud institution is defined by so much history, so much tradition, and marked by significant change, as was referenced earlier. Unlikeand overcome time and again to reorient yourself together with your squadron and your wing and find new ways to soar.
As been mentioned already, when COVID hit during the fourthyour 4-degree year, you had toexcuse meyou had to rapidly redeploy back to your homes and learn new ways to study and maintain camaraderie during ""COVID-cation.""
And by the way, I wonder how many of you had to kick your brother out of your room when you went back.
But all kidding aside, recognition may have been cut short, but it came back in the fall. You did the Run to the Rock. You earned the prop and wings, just like every cadet before you.
Resilience, creativity, endurance, commitmentthese have been essential parts of your unique Academy training. And you're going to need those qualities as you continue your careers because the world you are graduating into is not only changing rapidly, the pace of change is accelerating as well.
We are seeing proliferating global challenges, from Russia's aggression and brutality in Europe to our competition with China, and a whole hell of a lot in betweenfrom growing instability to food insecurity to natural disasters, all of which are being made worse by the existential threat of climate change.
I don't hear many of my friends anymore saying there's no climate change. They've finally figured it out. We've been trying to push that since 1981.
But we are seeing engaging technologyemerging technologies allAIfrom AI and 3D printingthat could change the character of conflict itself. They're not going to be easy decisions, guys.
I met in the Oval Officein my office with 12 leadingno, excuse me8 leading scientists in the area of AI. Some are very worried that AI can actually overtake human thinking and planning. So we've got a lot to deal withan incredible opportunity, but a lot to deal with.
We're also working across multiple domains, developing new capabilities, like our new next-gen B-21 Raider. And we'reyou're going to be flying that sucker.
And we are going to count on you to keep us at the forefront of air and space dominance, enabling an entire Joint Force to be stronger.
Graduates, you've made a noble choice to lead a life of service. Now you also shoulder a great privilege and a mighty responsibility: leadership. Yes, leadership, a word often used.
In the years ahead, your airmen and guardians are going to look to you for guidance and inspiration, because the world is going to get more confusing. They'll put their trust in you. And you, in turn, must strive to always be worthy of their confidence. Listen to them. Listen to them.
I've always believed that America is strongest when we lead not only by the example of our power, but by the power of our example. Let me say it again. I've traveled the entire world, been in almost every country. The reason why we're respected so much is not just our power, but the power of our example.
And it matters. It matters.
The same is going to be true in your own experience of leadership. No matter what changes or challenges come, your character, your moral clarity, your capabilities must never waver. Again, not hyperbole: The Nation needs yougenuinely needs you.
Our world stands at an inflection point. I had a professor who used to say an inflection point is when you're driving your car down a highway at 60 miles an hour and suddenly you turn the wheel 10 degrees. You can never get back on the same track you were on before. The decisions we make today are going to determine what the world looks like decades from now.
No graduating class gets to choose the world into which they graduate. Every class enters the history of a nation up to the point that has been written by others. But few classes, once every several generations, enters at a point in our history where they actually have a chance to changechangethe trajectory of the country.
It's the only reason I ran. I said to our speaker, I read his article. That's why when I ran, I said I was running for three purposes, two of which were to restore the character of this country and, two, to unite it.
You'll face that inflection point today, and I know you're going to meet the moment to make sure that the future we're building is one that fundamentally aligns with our values and protects America's interests; to make sure that our skies and orbits remain open and navigable to everyone; to make sure that new technology is used to lift people up to new heights, new opportunities, not hold them down or exploit them; and to make sure that the fundamental rules of the international system we put in place more than seven decades ago to prevent another world war are upheld and strengthened to address new threats.
One of the greatest strengths the United States of America brings to this effort is one of the greatest assets you will harness throughout your careers. It's our unmatched network of alliance and partnersallies and partners.
I've spent the bulk of my first year just reestablishing that, meeting hundreds of hours with our NATO allies and others, those nations who willingly stand beside us to face down threats and solve shared challenges.
You've already gotten some sense of that with the friendships and bonds you've built with the cadets graduating today, who will commission in their home militaries across Europe, the Middle East, North Africa, and the Indo-Pacific.
Our partnerships amplify our strength and make us more effective. And don't think our adversaries don't understand it. That's why they work so damn hard to try to split us.
We've sent itwe've said itwe've seen it over and over again, especially in the global support for the brave people of Ukraine as they defended their families and their homes against Russia's brutal assault.
Remember what was said? Putin was certain that NATO would crack, that they would not stand together. We put 40 nations together. The United States has rallied the world to stand strong with Ukraine and defend the values that the American people hold so dear: freedom, sovereignty, democracy, simple dignity.
Working with a coalition of more than 50 nations, we have delivered historic security assistance that has enabled Ukraine to defend itself. I've been there many times before the war, spoke at the Rada. I've been there since the war began.
The United States Air Force and Space Force have been the backbone of that operation, providing airlift capacity and logistical know-how to move artillery, ammunition, fighting vehicles, antitank, and air defense system; providing missile warning space-based ISR, supporting communications.
No other nation in the worldin the whole worldhas the enabling capacity we doand what we have to do to thank you and your immediate predecessors.
Just a few weeks ago, I was with President Zelenskyy in Hiroshima at the G-7. I told him that we'd work with our partners to begin training Ukrainian pilots in Europe on fourth-generation fighter aircraft, including the F-16, so Ukraine can defend itself today and in the future.
The Ukrainian people's iron resolve to live in freedom will never be broken. They are incredible: average women and men fighting, giving their lives for their country and their families.
And the American people's support for Ukraine will not waver. We'vealways stand up for democraciesalways. I'm going to ask you to contemplate what happens if it wavers and Ukraine goes down. What about Belarus? What about the rest of Eastern Europe?
Look, the G-7 also demonstrated remarkable unity in the world's leading democracies when it comes to China. The United StatesI've met with Xi Jinping more than any personmore than any leader in the world, starting back when I was Vice President.
The United States does not seek conflict or confrontation with China. China and the United States should be able to work together where we can to solve some global challenges like climate. But we are prepared for vigorous competition. And we will stand up for our interests, for our friends, and for our values.
With our G-7 partners, we issued a set of shared principles for engaging with China and minimizing the threats to our nations: by bolstering our economic security, resisting economic coercion, countering harmful practices, and protecting a narrow set of advanced technologies critical to our national security by not trading them.
By working together with nations that share the most fundamental values, we multiply one another's strength and firmly fix a course toward our shared vision for the future. In every part of the world, we advanced our partnerships in concrete ways that strengthen the American security.
In the Indo-Pacific, we've deepened our alliance and our trilateral cooperation with Japan and the Republic of Korea, who are now talking together and working together to enhance deterrence against threats in the region, including from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
We've elevated the Quad, bringing together Australia, India, Japan, and the United States to advance an Indo-Pacific that's free and open, prosperous and secure. It didn't exist before.
We're delivering on AUKUS, a new strategic partnership that brings the United States closer together with Australia and the United Kingdom, two of our most capable allies.
NATO is more energized and more united than it's been in decades, and it's now even stronger with the accession of our newest ally, Finland, and soon Sweden, in the alliance as soon as possible. [Applause] It will happen. I promise you.
We're working with Canada to upgrade NORAD's capabilities and ensure that North America's air defense surveillance systems are the best in the world.
And in just the past 12 months, I've hosted in the United States the leaders of every country in the Western Hemisphere, every country in Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands. We are a Pacific nation.
These nations may not all agree with us on every issue, but they want to work with us; they choose us, not because of threats or coercion, but because of the common interests we pursue together to make the world a better and safer place for everyone. Thatthatis what the United States stands for.
When people around the world see a United States gray tail flying overhead or the stars and stripes on your shoulders, they know what that means no matter where you go: freedom, opportunity, possibilities, hope. It's who we are. It's what we fight for. It's why we choose this path.
So, graduates, as you head out, whether to graduate school or pilot training, to serve as missileers or space operations, scientists or engineers, never forget the sacred oath you swear and the mission you serve is something far, far greater than any person or President. It's our Constitution. It's our country. And it's our enduring American values.
You know, we're the most unique nation in the world. And say, ""Well, everybody says""but we are. We're the only nation in the world formed and based on an idea. An idea. Every other nation in the world is formed based on things like geography, ethnicity, religion.
We're the only nation built on an idea that we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights: life, liberty, pursuit ofthat's the organizing principle of America.
We haven't always lived up to it, but we neverexcept on one brief momenteven thought about walking away from it. Generations of our forebears have fought and sacrificed to defend it, sacrifices we honored earlier this week on Memorial Day.
My son was an Army officer, a major; the attorney general who sought permission to go fight with his unit in Iraq for a year. Unfortunately, his hooch was very close to these burn pits, and he came home with stage 4 glioblastoma and died.
I remember looking at him in the bed. This is the God's truth. I hadn't planned on saying this, and maybe I shouldn't. He looked at me and saidand we're talking about war. He said, ""Dad""he was attorney general, odds-on favorite to become the Governor. He said: ""Dad, the proudest thing I've ever done in my life is putting on that uniform. The proudest thing.""
Just before he passed, he said: ""I'm not afraid. I'm not afraid.""
That's what you all are made of as well: pride. Pridenot in yourself, but what you're fighting for. It's a sacred charge that you now inherit as well.
This year, we mark the 75th anniversarythis yearof an integrated force, the 75th anniversary of women serving in the force, and the 50th anniversary of an All-Volunteer military. And your class is one of the diversemost diverse classes in the history of this Academy or any academy to graduate. That's why we're strong. That's why we're who we are. That's why we'll never give up. That's why!
We also recognize that with every step we've taken to harness the full diversity of our Nation, to tap more of our indomitable American spirit, our Armed Forces have only grown stronger, more effective, and more admired. The same is true of this institution.
This year's graduating class is among the most diverse in academy history. You're graduating the highest percentage of women. By the way, I met with thewho are those guys that fly over shortly? You've heard of them, haven't you? Three of them are women. [Laughter] So don't screw around, guys. And the highest percentage of minority cadets in history.
You're a strengthening force, a force that dependsdependson American values, that reflect America itself. And each of you has an obligation to treat the airmen and guardians you lead and everyone you encounter with dignity. Your honor code says, ""We will not lie, steal, or cheat, nor tolerate among us anyone who does.""
So it's on all of you to root out the scourge of sexual assault and harassment in the military and to never tolerate it amongnever tolerate it; to make sure that every member of our Armed Forces, no matter who they are, who they love, feels safe and respected in the ranks.
Class of 2023
Audience members. Thor!
The President. you've been trained to lead, to set an example of leadership for others. You've been given the skillset to think clearly, to make strategic decisions, and to do what is right, under pressure.
You've earned the trust and respect of your fellow cadets and your instructors. And you are the very embodiment of the American military excellence, and you are ready for anything. Anything.
As I look out today, I give you my word as a Biden: I've never been more optimisticnever been more optimisticabout the future of this country, in no small part because of you. I mean it sincerely.
Four years ago, you arrived as individuals. Today, you're part of a Long Blue Line. Future generations will stand in your footsteps, strive to meet the heights that yourof your expectations, draw inspiration from the example of honor and integrity that you're going to set.
Held aloft by the core values you learned here, our Air Force, our Space Force, our Joint Force, indeed our Nation, is safe and steady hands with all of you.
May God protect you all as you set out on your journeys. And rememberremember: Never bend, never bow, never yield. And remember who we are.
May the Lord guard and guide the ones who fly through great space and sky, and may God protect all those who wear the uniform of the United States of America.
Let us hear us one more time for the class of 2023.

2023-05-31 00:00:00,Remarks Following a Briefing on Extreme Weather Preparedness Efforts and an Exchange With Reporters,"
The President. I just had a significant briefing from Cabinet members and agency chiefs to prepare for the 2023 hurricane season and peak wildfire season.
And last year, hurricanes and other extreme weather events here in the United States caused over $165 billion in damages. Three hurricanesFiona, Ian, and Nicolemade landfall and did damage across a half a dozen States.
Thanks to the National Oceanic andOceanic Atmosphere andOceanic and Atmospheric Administrationso-called NOAAnew hurricane modeling systems, we're getting more and more accurate forecasting of hurricanestheir tracks, their intensity, their associated storm surgewhich means saving more lives because we can anticipate what is likely to happen with greater accuracy.
But there's more to do. Just last week, a supertyphoon weakened havewrecked havoc across Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands, causing a tremendous amount of damage. And our hearts go out to the people who have been affected.
But the pace of recovery there is an example of the importance of investing in our infrastructure. Recently installed cement utility poles mitigated the damage of the typhoon-force winds on the island's electric and communications systemsas opposed to wooden posts, which would have snapped. But the poles cost more up frontthat's obviousbut they save money, they save lives, and they last a long time.
And the summer is also bringing a more active wildfire season to the United States. This year alone, wildfires have destroyed an area almost as big as the State of Maryland. Over the past 2 years, a third of Americans have been personally affected by extreme weather conditions.
With the impacts of climate change rapidly intensifying, more and more Americans will be affected. That's why we've also invested so much in making sure we deal with climate change and mitigate it.
We've just discussed the significant actions we've taken to help address these disasters and to mitigate the damage going forward. My ""Investing in America"" agenda includes new investments to make our communities stronger, to make our communities more resilient, and we're making the most significant investment ever in combating the climate crisis.
For example, the bipartisan infrastructure law, the Inflation Reduction Actthey both include record funding to increase community resilience to drought, flooding, and wildfireslike funding to clear trees and brush to create fire buffers in high-risk areas.
For example, I'm traveling to Colorado this afternoon, where the Forest Service is funding $1.1 million to treat 600 acres of hazardous fuels, like trees and brush. This project, with over 300 homes and buildings in the area, is going to reduce the overall risk of wildfire in that area and, God willing, if anything happens, save lives.
We're also harnessing new tools like advanced satellite technology that's going to help get better at predicting where wildfires and storms are going so that we can better position our resources ahead of time to respond. We've funded over 130 water projects to address the drought crisis in the West, including projects that are going to conserve tens of millions of gallons of water in drought-stricken areas like the Colorado River Basin.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers isthe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationthey've funded hundreds of projects across the country to improve flood and coastal resilience.
We're hardeningI asked about one coastala particular towncity. And instead of building back thethe beach to the point where it waswhere it was before, you put how much more sand?
Lieutenant General Scott A. Spellmon, Chief of Engineers and Commanding General, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Yes, sir. Basically, we're building it back to its full design profile. So instead of 30,000 cubic yards of sand, over 100,000 cubic yards of sand.
The President. Which is going to increase resilience as well and save people.
And we're hardening the electric grid to withstand stronger storms with stronger materials, and we're burying lines where we can. And that's likely to increase, God willing. We're creating microgrids to reduce the impact when power goes out and make it possible to get back up and running faster after a storm.
We're also funding conservation, restoration, and protection of coastal areas and flood resilience projects in disadvantaged communities. Across the country, we've got 32,000 projects funded or underway.
And if you want to find out what's going on in your area and how you may be impacted, just go to build.govbuild.gov. And you can see a map and theof the projects and search by county as to whether or not your community is affected and what we're doing in that community.
I want to close by thanking the brave Americansand I mean that sincerelythe brave Americans who put their lives on the line to keep our communities safeto the firefighters and other first responders, including FEMA personnel, who run toward danger while everyone else runs the other way.
And by the waywe were talking here earlierwe have firefighters in Canada right now helping the Canadians fight significant fires. They've helped us.
And we also have relationships with Australia. We have arelationships around the world with organizationswith firefighting organizations that are available to us as we're making our firefighters available to them and theirour rescue people.
So thank you all very much for coming in.
And, again, go to build.gov, and you'll see a map there. And you can check what is in store for your communities and what we're doing.
Thank you.
[At this point, several reporters spoke at once.]

Q. Mr. President, some progressives don't like the debt ceilingdebt deal. What's your message to them?
The President. I toldII told all these guys you wouldn't ask anything about what we just talked about. [Laughter] Was I right? Just wanted to show you I was right, right? Now, we're going to deal with the debt ceiling. We havewe haveI think things are going as planned, God willing.
I'll haveI'll be landing in Colorado tonight in preparation for my commencement speech at the Air Force Academy tomorrow. And, God willing, by the time I land, the Congress will have acted, the House will have acted, and we'll be one step closer.
Thank you very much. Appreciate it.

2023-05-29 00:00:00,"Remarks at a Memorial Day Ceremony in Arlington, Virginia","
Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Please.
One hundred and fifty-five years ago, retired Union General James Garfield spoke here at Arlington, marking our Nation's first Memorial Day. Standing amid rows and rows of marble stones, many of his own fallen soldiers among them, he asked: ""What brought these men here? What high motive led them to . . . welcome death?"" And he answered his own question. He said, ""Our Nation's life.""
My fellow Americans, Jill, Vice President Harris, Second Gentleman Emhoff, Secretary Austin, Secretary McDonough, Secretary Mayorkas, General Milley, and most importantly, veterans, service men and women, and their survivors: Today we once again gather in this sacred place, at this solemn hour, to honor fallen heroes, to once again stand amid the rows and rows of marble stones and bear witness to the brave women and men who served and sacrificed for our freedom and for our future; those who died so our Nation might live.
Every year, as a nation, we undertake this rite of remembrance, for we must never forget the price that was paid to protect our democracy. We must never forget the lives these flags, flowers, and marble markers represent: a mother, a father, a son, a daughter, a sister, a spouse, a friend. An American.
Every year, we remember. And every year, it never gets easier.
To all those here and across the Nation who are grieving the loss of a loved one who wore the uniform, our Gold Star families, and to all those with loved ones still missing, unaccounted for, I know how painful it can be, how it can reopen thatrip open that black hole in the center of your chest you feel like you're just sinking into, bringing you back to that exact moment you heard that knock on the door or the telephone ring, the exact moment you had to tell your children that mom or dad would not be coming home.
The hurt is still real. It's still raw.
Tomorrow marks 8 years since we lost our son Beau. Our losses are not the same. He didn't perish in the battlefield. It was cancer that stole him from us a year after being deployed as a major in the United States Army National Guard in Iraq.
As it is for so many of you, the pain of his loss is with us every day, but particularly sharp on Memorial Day. It's still clear. Tomorrow is his anniversary. But so is the pride Jill and I feel in his service, as if I can still hear him saying, ""Dadit's my duty, Dad."" ""It's my duty."" Duty.
That was the code my son lived by and all those you lost lived by. It's the creed that millions of servicemembers have followedfrom the fields of Yorktown to the shores of Normandy, to the rice paddies of Pusan, to the valleys of Kandahar, to the mountains of Sinjar, and beyondmany of whom never returned home.
Throughout history, these women and men laid down their lives, not for a place or a person or a President, but for an idea unlike any other idea in all of human history, the ideathe ideaof the United States of America.
This sanctuary honors that sacrifice and tells their stories. And in turn, it tells our storythe American story: a story of the patriot who died to deliver a nation where everyone is entitled to certain unalienable rights, among them life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness; the story of hundreds of thousands of soldiers who shed their blood to make these words real; the story of the brave Americans who fought the forces of fascism and died for preservation of democracy.
As we're reminded by the hundreds of graves here in Section 60 of Arlington and across our Nationthe story of the women and men who sacrificed everything to keep democracy safe and secure during the last two decadeseach of themeach of them a link in a chain of honor that stretches back to our Founding Fathers and those days. Unbreaking, unbending, not just in their duty and devotion, but something even deeper: in their faith in ustheir faith in usthat we will be worthy of their sacrifice.
Our servicemembers have always embodied the highest expectations of our democracy. They've always held faith in our country, in all that we could be: a citadel of liberty, a beacon of freedom. For our democracy is our strength, the wellspring of possibilities, and the source of endless, endless renewal.
It's how we've been able to constantly change and adapt through the centuries. It's why we've always emerged from every challenge we face stronger than we entered it. It's how we come together as one Nation, united, and why there's nothing we can't do in America when we do it together.
It's a truth we celebrate this year as we mark 75 years of a desegregated military, 75 years of women's full integration, 50 years of an All-Volunteer force. Throughout the annals of history, our troops have fought for our democracy and, if necessary, died for it. And today, their service and sacrifice, and that of their families, echoes far beyond those silent stones out there.
We see it in the strength of our NATO alliance, built from the bonds that we forever forged in the fires of two World Wars. We see it in the troops still standing sentinel on the Korean Peninsula, preserving peace side by side with our allies. We see it at every base, every barrack, every vessel around the globe where our military proudly serves and stands as a force for good in the world.
And just as they have kept the ultimate faith to our country, to our democracy, we must keep the ultimate faith to them. As a nationand people have all heard me say this for a long timeas a nation, we have many obligations, but I believe with every fiber of my being we have only one truly sacred obligation: to prepare those we send into harm's way and care for them and their families when they come home and when they don't.
It's a sacred obligation, not based on party or politics, but on a promise, a promise to unite all of us. There is nothing more important, nothing more sacred, nothing more American.
But together, over the last 2 years, we've worked to make good on that promise, passing more than 25 bipartisan laws to support our servicemembers, their families, caregivers, and survivors.
That includes the PACT Act, the most significant law in our Nation's history, to help millions of veterans who were exposed to toxic substances and burn pits during their military service. Pits the size of football fields that incinerated the wastes of war such as tires, chemicals, jet fuel, and so much more.
Too many of our Nation's warriors that have selflessly served only to return home and suffer from the permanent effects of this poisonous smoke. Too many have diedexcuse the personal referencelike my son Beau, or like Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson, for whom the act is named. Last year, after I signed the PACT Act, I handed the pen to his daughter Brielle. She and her grandmother are with us today.
After I handed her the pen, this beautiful little girl, who's sitting over therethank you for waving, baby[applause]who had lost half of her worldher whole worldheld the pen in her hand, and looked at me and said, ""Thank you for my daddy."" ""Thank you for my daddy."" God love you, honey.
But I don't think she was just thanking me. She was thanking all of us, everyone who fought so hard and came together to keep our promise to our veterans, to keep faith with our heroes.
On this day, we come together again to reflect, to remember, but above all, to recommit to the future our fallen heroes fought for, that generations of servicemembers who died for a future grounded in freedom, democracy, equality, tolerance, opportunity, and yes, justice. We use those words all the time, but we've seen of late here, and around the world, that they have to continually be fought for, not just for some, but for all.
This is more important than just our system of government. It's the very soul of America: a soul that was forged by our Nation's first patriots; a soul that triumphed over trials and testing less than a century later; a soul that endured because of the sacrifices of generations and generations of the servicemembers ever since.
Together, we're not just the fortunate inheritors of their legacy. We must be the keeper of their mission, the bearers of the flame of freedom that kept burning bright for nearly 247 years.
Thatthat's the truest memorial to their lives: our actions every day to ensure that our democracy endures, our Constitution endures, and the soul of our Nation and our decency endures.
Ladies and gentlemen, 155 years ago, our ancestors stood here and asked themselves: What brought our heroes to this hallowed ground? What high motive led these brave souls, as General Garfield said, to welcome death?
Today, we must ask ourselves what can we do, what must we do to uphold the vision for which they lived and which they died. Today, it's on all of usall of usto ensure that sacrifice was not in vain; to keep working toward a more perfect Union, one where all women and all men are created equal.
We're the only nation in the world built on an idea. Every other nation is formed based on things like geography, ethnicity, religion. We're the only nation in the world built on an idea that we're all created equal. We haven't always lived up to it, but we've never walked away from it.
And today, standing together to honor those Americans who dared all and gave all for our Nation, we can say clearly: We never will.
God bless who gaveall those who gave their lives so our Nation might live, God bless their families, and may God protect our troops, today and always.
Thank you.

2023-05-28 00:00:00,Remarks on Federal Budget Negotiations and the Public Debt Limit and an Exchange With Reporters,"
The President. Happy Sunday.
Q. Thank you.
The President. I'm sorry to keep you waiting, but we've got good news. We've got aI just spoke with Speaker McCarthy, and we've reached a bipartisan budget agreement that we're ready to move to the full Congress.
And I think it's a really important step forwardexcuse me.
[At this point, the President cleared his throat.]
And it takes the threat of catastrophic default off the table; it protects our hard-earned and historic economic recovery. And the agreement also represents a compromise, which means no one got everything they want. But that's the responsibility of governing.
And thethis is a deal that's good news for, I believe you'll see, for the American people. The agreement prevents the worst possible crisis: a default for the first time in our Nation's history, an economic recession, retirement accounts devastated, millions of jobs lost.
It also protects key priorities and accomplishments and values that congressional Democrats and I have fought long forlong and hard for. Investing in America's agendathat's creating goods jobs in communities throughout the country. It protects Social Security, Medicare, and veterans, and so much more.
The Speaker and I made clear from the start that the only way forward was a bipartisan agreement. That agreement now goes to the United States House and to the Senate. And I strongly urge bothbothChambers to pass that agreement.
Let's keep moving forward on meeting our obligations and building the strongest economy in the history of the world.
I'll take a few questions.
Public Debt Limit and Federal Budget Negotiations 
Q. Mr. President, you said at the beginning that the debt ceiling was not negotiable. Isn't that what you've just done here? And isn't that what you've[inaudible]?
The President. You guyslook, we're not negotiating the debt ceiling. Here's the deal: They passedthey said they're going toif they pass the debt ceiling, and they said they'd only do it on condition that it have all these cuts in it. I said: ""I'm not going to do that. You pass the debt ceiling, period. I'll negotiate with you on the cutswhat you say what's going to happen, what the budget is going to look like.""
That's what we are negotiating in order to get to them deciding that they're going to go along with a new debt ceiling, meaning that it's not attached. Something totally different attached than was attached before.
But if you want to try to make it look like I made some compromise on the debt ceiling, I didn't. I made a compromise on the budget.
Q. But that's what they wanted, is you to make a compromise on the budget, and that's what you've done, even though you haven't gone as far as they wanted. Isn't that right?
The President. Sure. Yes. Well[laughter]can you think of an alternative? [Laughter]
Federal Budget Negotiations 
Q. Mr. President, what do you say to members of your own party who say you've made too many concessions in this deal?
The President. They'll find I didn't.
International Perceptions of U.S. Budgeting Process 
Q. Mr. President, on your allies and adversaries to America, would you be willing to say about what you think this process said to those adversaries and allies? You have a deal now, but what does the process say? What does the struggle say to them?
The President. Well, it says we've been through this more than once, and it's just the nature of the way we handle the deficit and handle whether we're going to, each year, going to pay our debts. And it's happened more than once. It will probably happen again. But it's not going to happen at least for another 2 years here. And I don't think beyondI think beyond that, it won't either.
Public Debt Limit 
Q. Mr. President, do you think it's time for the U.S. to get rid of the debt limit? That this isyou know, for thatthe reason you just laid out?
The President. No, I think it would cause more controversy getting rid of the debt limit, although I doI am exploring the idea that we would at a later date, a year or two from now, decide whether or not the 14th Amendmenthow that actually would impact on whether or not you need to reduce the debt limit every year. But that's another day.
Thank you all.
Speaker of the House of Representatives Kevin O. McCarthy 
Q. Mr. President, do you believe Speaker McCarthy has the votes? And did he negotiate in good faith?
The President. I think he negotiated with me in good faith. He kept his word. He said what he would do. He did what he said he'd do. And I have no idea whether he has the votes. I expect he does, or I don't think he would have made the agreement.
Turkey 
Q. Mr. President, do you have a comment on the elections in Turkey? Have you spoken with President Erdogan?
The President. I have not spoken to him yet.
Q. Do you have a comment?
Federal Budget Negotiations 
Q. Some of your Democratic colleagues are saying that this policy will lead some people to go hungry. What is your response to that?
The President. It's a ridiculous assertion.
Timing of the President's Federal Budget Negotiations 
Q. Do you wish you had started these negotiations sooner?
The President. No, it wouldn't have made any difference.
Q. Mr. President, is financial aid for Ukraine secured in your new budget?

And you started this year, you know, unranked, and then you went 14-and-oh. And just to keep everybody's interest, you lost the next six of eight games[laughter]and they counted you out. It's not bad, isn't it? But you got a coach who decided that doesn't matter. And, hell, he knows something about how to win.
Heby the way, he's brandnew to basketball, in the family. [Laughter] You knowbut you bounced back with a resounding 15-2 run. That ain't bad, man: 15-2 run.
Startedseededyou were a fourth seed, and you won every single game by double digits; in the final blowout, a fifth national championship. Congratulations. Congratulations. Nothing like a comeback, man. I think you all did that deliberately. You know what I mean? [Laughter] To keep peoplelook, you know, andand did it all as a team, and the whole country could see it. Anybody who loves basketball watched it all.
When three players fast through Final Four because ofit falls during the holy month of Ramadan, the country sees what it means to commit to something bigger than yourself.
And when another star player scores 16 points after being sick all night with food poisoning[laughter]he's nuts. I mean, I don't know how the hell you did that, man. [Laughter] I don't know how you did that. Prettyyou know, it gets the sense of what it means to dig deep and show up for others.
And you know, with Coach Hurley's family in the stands, on the sidelines, on the court, and the country got to see what it means to devote your whole life to a shared passion. And, Coach, you had an unwavering and unyielding belief in this team, and it was clear, and it made a difference.
This team is proof that there's no quit in UConn, just like there's no quit in America. None. There's nothing we can't do when we believe we can do it if we do it together. And that's exactly what you all did. You stood up.
And that's what sports and this country is all about: possibilities. Possibilities.
And one more thing: I hosted the LSU women's team earlier today for their championship title. Jordan, I heard you and your cousinyou know, Angelplayed one-on-one growing up. Is that true?
Guard Jordan Hawkins. We did.
The President. You did? [Laughter]
One's the child of a brother; the other, the child of a sister. So I've set up a basketball court on the South Lawn. [Laughter] There's a court down there by the tennis courts. And, Jordan, your uncle thinks he can take you as well. [Laughter] So I just want you to know that we're going toafter this, we're all going down to see that one-on-one game.
I tell you what, man, it's in the blood, isn't it? [Laughter] It's in the blood. What a greatwhat an incredible thing. What an incredible thing.
And congratulations to the whole UConn Nation. It's got to make you feel good.
How many here arefamily members have a son or a daughtera son up here? A mom, dad, brother, sister out there? Raise your hand.
Look at whose hand goes up first. I've got to find out what your name is. [Laughter]
What
Child. Luke.
The President. What's your name?
Child. Luke.
The President. Do you know anybody up there?
Child. My dad.
The President. You're kidding me. [Laughter]
Hi. What's your name?
Audience member. Go ahead. Say it in the microphone.
Child. Cash.
The President. Cash, I tell you whatI want to know who your haberdasher is, man. [Laughter] You're looking good.
Anyway, look, this is a family affair. I want to wish youthank you all for being here.
And you know, there's nothing likethink about anywhenever the Nation has been down, what's always brought us back? Sports. Sport. And thank God we're not down yet. But you guys are something else. And I wish you all the best of luck in the whole world.
How many of you graduate this year or leave this year? Well, you've gotwe've got room on the team down here too, you know what I mean?
So thank you so very, very much.
Madam President, thank you. I started to ask the president about the team, and she started to tell me it was a great team, but then she started to tell me all the other significant things that happened at UConn. Okay? [Laughter]
And so I just want you to knowand I want to just wish you all the best of luck. And God bless you all.
And I'm going to turn this over to Coach Hurley.
Coach.
[The President pointed to the podium microphones.]
The President. Any one you want to do.
Head Coach Dan Hurley. ItII
The President. And by the way, he married a Jersey girl too. [Laughter]
Coach Hurley. Jersey girl. It's worked out pretty good for both of us. Yes, no doubt.
The President. We both married way above our station.
Coach Hurley. Yes, we did. [Laughter] Yes, we did.
I always would really dread speaking after Geno Auriemma. This is a whole 'nother level[laughter]whole 'nother level of fear right here, coming up here. So I'm going to stick to my script. [Laughter]
Yes, so, Mr. President, you know, you grow up in sports, and obviously, you know the sacrifice and commitment, you know, it takes to achieve anything great. But you know, you grow up, you're working and competing, you know, dreaming of achieving something, like, really enormous, something really big in team sports.
And it's, like, the first thing that comes to your mindright?when you do something big and win that incredible championship is like: You know, we get to go to the White House and meet the President of the United States. And it's such an honor to meet you, President Biden. So thank you for having us here.
And it's an honor that you truly got to earn, you know? Toyou know, to earn one of the greatest honors in sports, you'veyou know, you've got to work. And obviously, you never forget it. You know, but you earn it through having tremendous, you know, culture and brotherhood, you know, which we work to every day to develop as a program.
Obviously, this team'syou know, their abilities on the court, you know, were unmatched in terms of anyone in the country. This was, you know, truly the elite teamyou know, the elite team in college basketball.
We had the greatest leadership in terms of what we got from our older players in Andre Jackson and Adama Sanogo. We had a really miserable[applause]. Yes. Right? You know, like politics and sports, two tough businesses to get into, right? [Laughter]
You know, January was a rough month, and the leadership of those two men, you know, really got us through a really difficult time. And you know, this becomes, you know, one of the greatest teams in UConn's storied basketball history. This team right here. So I couldn't be prouder.
Mr. President, Dr. Biden, Vice President Harris, Second Gentleman Emhoff, and the White House staff who have been unbelievable todayyou know, it's crazy too, by the way, right? These cameras and all the[laughter]you know, the people playing the music. [Laughter] Telling
The President. You're telling me!
Coach Hurley. No, you know what was crazyI've got to say this too: The police escortswe could get used to that. [Laughter] Right? And particularly when you're in Houston, man. Those copsthe police there in Houstonman, they were a well-oiled machine. We were getting places fast. [Laughter]
But on behalf of UConnUniversity of Connecticut, the great State of Connecticut, and then all of Husky Nation, I just want to thank you and your administration, you know, for providing for us like what will be a day and memories we will never forget.
And then, as a token of our appreciation over there, we're going to have our captains, Adama Sanogo and Andre Jackson, Jr., present you with that UConn jersey. [Laughter] You don't want him posting you up, President. [Laughter] That's a big boy.
The President. No, no, no, I want him standing next to me. [Laughter]
[Guard Andre Jackson, Jr., and forward Adama Sanogo presented the President with a team jersey.]
The President. I thought these guys were standing on risers. [Laughter]

2023-05-26 00:00:00,Remarks Honoring the NCAA Women's Basketball Champion Louisiana State University Tigers,"
The President. Thank you. Please, be seated. This is getting old hat for the coach. [Laughter] She's been here with 19 Presidents. [Laughter] All with championship teams. But I think this may be her best moment in terms of the team she's with.
Folks, thanks, Kamala and Jill. And you just described how inspiring this team is, and we we're joined by many, many fans all across the country. And by the way, it seems to me half the folks in this room are from Louisiana.
I want to welcome back President Tate. The last time we were in the White House, we talked about the leadership guiding the university through the pandemic. This time, we're celebrating the champions that have captivated the Nation with their talent and their heart and their grit.
You know, we're joined by Members of the Louisiana delegationTroy Carter, Garret Graves, Mike Johnsonand a lot of alumni too. We have the proud alumni of Louisiana State here in my Cabinet. Linda Thomas-Greenfield. Stand up, Madam Ambassador. [Laughter] Class of 2004, right? [Laughter]
U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield. Yes. [Laughter]
The President. Okay. All right.
She brought[laughter]she's brought hershe's brought globalglobal leaders together. You know how she does it? She's up in the United Nationsand by the way, she's a major, major player in this administration. And I wondered how is she getting all these folks up in theyou know, the United Nations to work together. She gives themshe takes them to her kitchen[laughter]no, no, noto get to know each other. She calls it the ""gumbo diplomacy."" [Laughter] No, that's notnot a joke.
Director of Management and Budget Shalanda Young. Where is Shalanda? There you go. Shalanda Young back there, Director of Management and Budget, putting together a deal, hopefully. She grew up in
[At this point, the President spoke briefly in a Louisiana accent as follows.]
Baton Rouge[laughter]in Clinton, Louisiana, and is now helping lead the critical budget talks forin the middle of now. But she said, ""I'm notI'm leaving the talks to be here."" [Laughter]
And we're all here to celebrate a remarkable group of student athletes. You know, Angel, Alexis, Jasmine, Flau'jae, you know, the entire team. You'reless than a year ago, you'd never even played together.
And, Coach, like I said, you're Hall of Fame, man. I tell you. [Laughter] That'sIisn't this getting old for youwinning all this time? [Laughter] A Hall of Fame championship coach had a vision: nine new players joined into one powerhouse team.
You started the season five straight 100-point games. Continued into the record 23-and-0 run. Rolled through the regular season with the best in the nearly 20 years and into the Big Dance and one of the most exciting Final Fours ever, winning LSU's first national championship basketball title.
Angela Reeseor, excuse me, Angel, youyou're named the Most Outstanding Player. Wasn't any reasonit didn't surprise me. [Laughter] Demand for tickets was so high youyou couldn'tyou know, you made them more expensive for people to come. [Laughter] You know what I mean? The cost of tickets went up 10 times. Ten times. And more than the men's games. [Laughter]
The final was the most viewed game in the history of women's basketball. More viewers than anythan the NBA playoffs. And, folks, we witnessed history. And here's what else we saw: Parents and children who watched every single one of your games together, sometimes driving 10 hours just to see you play. And thenand then we've seen you take the time to talk to them, to laugh with them, to show millions of our daughters they can do anything as well. Anything.
You know, in this team, we saw hope, we saw pride, and we saw purpose. It matters. You know, it's been 51 years since Congress passed title IX, guaranteeing all and girls equal right to participate not only in sports, but in any school program.
Today, 58 percentand that's amy colleagues don't like me always mentioning thisbut 58 percent of all college students are women, up from 42 percent[applause]not athletesin college are women. And there are now about 10 times more female athletes in college and high school than there were. Millions more women are getting sports scholarships and a chance not just to play, but to earn degrees and build their lives. But there's more progress to make.
In the media, 95 percent of sports stories are still about men. It's not an issue though[laughter]not with this team. [Laughter] Folks, we need to support women's sports not just during the championship runs, but the entire year, in every season. Showing up in person. Watching on television. Creating more programming and sponsorand scholarships and sponsorships and opportunities for millions of women and girls to realize their dreams and know they can do literally anything at all.
You know, I used to tell our daughters, our granddaughters, they can do anything at all. Anything any man can do, they can do. And that's what makesthat's what America is all about: possibilities. And that's what this team is all about: incredible athletes redefining what's possible.
And one more thing: We're hosting the UConn's men basketball team later today. And they're the men's champs
[Louisiana State University Tigers forward Sa'Myah Smith fainted on stage.]
The President. It's a lot of standing. Folks, it's okay. We're getting
[The President paused as Ms. Smith received assistance.]
The President. Everything is okay. We're going toeverything is all right. It's a lot of standing. I apologize.
[The event was delayed while Ms. Smith received medical care.]
The President. She's okay. She'sit's happened lots of times.
[Ms. Smith continued to receive care. The President then resumed his remarks as follows.]
The President. Well, it'slike I said: This is not the first time it's happened, not to her but to anya lot of folks standing up on this stage. So, folks, theI know it's time to move on, but the one thing I understandI started to say: Later this afternoon I'm going to be with the Connecticut team, the men's team, and your cousin wants to have a one-on-one. [Laughter] I'm putting my money on you, kid.
Forward Angel Reese. Okay. [Laughter]
The President. Did you know that? She's got ashe's got a cousinstarts on another team. I think hiswhat's his name? Hawkins? Something like that?
Ms. Reese. Jordan.
The President. Jordan, do you think? Maybe, yes?
Ms. Reese. Yes. [Laughter]
The President. Yes, well, we've gotwe've gotwe've got a bet going in ourinside. So wethere's a basketball court down below. [Laughter] You think I'm joking. So we're going to work something out here, right?
Ms. Reese. Yes.
The President. One on one? [Laughter]
Forward Emily Ward. I have Angel.
The President. Yes, I've got Angel too. [Laughter]
And besides, I've got Secret Service to make sure Angel's going to win. [Laughter]
I tell you what, between a brother and a sister having two stars on championship ball clubs the same year, it ain't bad. But they're all around the Baltimore area, right?
Yes. That's my familyall of my family was from
[The President briefly imitated a Baltimore accent.]
Bawlmer. Bawlmer, as they say.
At any rate, thank you all, again, for yourfor your patience for being here.
Look, there's an awful lotan awful lot to be proud of. And the way in which women's sports has come along, it's just incredible. And you're changing theand it's not just in sports. It's across the board in every single thing. And it's really neat to see since I've got four granddaughters.
We had some pretty good athletes. I wasn't a bad athlete; my brothers weren't. But all the real athletes in this family are women. [Laughter] Soyou've got it. You've got it.
Any rateso, thank you all for being here.
Coach, I'm going to turn this over to you. And I, again, want to congratulate you. I assume I'll be seeing you next year and next year. So[laughter].
Head Coach Kim Mulkey. Thank you, sir.
And by the way, that doesn't even count the new fashion line she's going to come out with. [Laughter]
Coach Mulkey. Thank you.
The President. Thank you.
Coach Mulkey. Thank you. The President. All yours, kid. You might want to use that.
Coach Mulkey. Do I have to? [Laughter]
The President. No.
Coach Mulkey. No.
The President. You can use this, if you want.
Coach Mulkey. It doesn't matter.
The President. Either one. You can leave, if you want; anything you want to do. [Laughter]
Coach Mulkey. Well, as you can see, we leave our mark where we go. [Laughter] Sa'Myah planned that.
No, Sa'Myah is fine. For those of you who are concerned, Sa'Myah is fine. I'll assure you of that. She's kind of, right now, embarrassed. She doesn't want to leave; she wants to stand with us, but she needs to be checked out.
I would like to thank you, President Biden, Vice President Harris. I don't want to get emotional here, but we are a proud State. I came back to the State of Louisiana to be a positive. Little did I know that I would get to coach this group of people. They came to our State, and you are looking at the finest our State has to offer right here.
We have parents here. I don't think I've ever come where the parents were allowed to come. That touches my heart. We have my grandchildren, my family. We have coaches' families. We have administrators here. As I said, we're very, very proud.
I would like for Angel Reese, I would like for Emily Wardour cocaptainsto present to you and your better half, Dr. Jill Biden[laughter]a token of our appreciation.
Get in the picture. Get in the picture. [Laughter]
[Ms. Reese and Ms. Ward presented the President and the First Lady with matching team jerseys and posed for a photograph.]
The President. By the way, one thing about Louisiana is it's dangerous. You know why? Our daughter was going to go to school where her brothers went to school, but she decided to go to Tulane. [Laughter]
And I was worriedand see that guy down there? Landrieu, the former mayor.
Coach Mulkey. I know a thing or two about his father, Moon.
The President. Oh, I know tooand his father, Moon, is a hell of a guy and took care of my daughter. Because I was worried she was going to come home with some boy from Bayou La Fouche or something, you know? [Laughter]
Coach Mulkey. Yes.
The President. And talking funny. I couldn't understand. You know what I mean?
Coach Mulkey. We still speak the French language. Whatthat part of Louisiana hasn't washed away yet.
The President. I know. Well, none of it is going to wash away. And besides, it's an incredible, incredible State.
But anyway, thank you, thank you, thank you.
Coach Mulkey. Thank you. We are honored.

2023-05-25 00:00:00,"Remarks on the Nomination of United States Air Force Chief of Staff General Charles Q. Brown, Jr., To Be Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff","
The President. Good afternoon. Please, everybody, be seated. Thank you.
Federal Budget Negotiations/Public Debt Limit 
Before I begin, I want to address aongoing budget negotiations with congressional leaders. I'll be very brief.
Speaker McCarthy and I have had several productive conversations, and our staffs continue to meet as we speak, as a matter of fact, and they're making progress.
I've made clear time and again: Defaulting on our national debt is not an option. The American people deserve to know that their Social Security payments will be there, that veterans hospitals remain open, and that economic progress will be made and we're going to continue to make it.
Default puts all that at risk. Congressional leaders understand that, and they've all agreed: There will be no default. And it's time for Congress to act now.
Now, I want to be clear that the negotiations we're having with Speaker McCarthy is about the outlines of what the budget will look like, not about default. It's about competing visions for America.
Under my administration, we've already cut the deficit by $1.7 trillion in our first 2 years. But Speaker McCarthy and I have a very different view of who should bear the burden of additional efforts to get our fiscal house in order. I don't believe the whole burden should fall on the backs of middle class and working class Americans. My House Republican friends disagree.
Instead, Republicans passed a bill that would make huge cuts in important programs that millions of working and middle class Americans count on. Huge cuts in the number of teachers, police officers, Border Patrol agents, and increased wait times for Social Security claims. And I won't agree to that.
I put forward a proposal that will cut spending by more than $1 trillion, that freezes spending for the next 2 years. That's on top of the nearly $3 trillion in deficit reduction I previously proposed through a combination of spending cuts and new revenue raisers.
I've proposed making the wealthy begin to pay their fair share, which will reduce the deficit. But it won't cut programs for hard-working Americans depending on itthose fundsin order to continue big tax returns for the wealthiest AmericansAmericaand America's largest corporations.
But we can reduce the deficit both in short term and long term with a combination of spending cuts on programs that help Big Oil and Big Pharma by closing tax loopholes and making the wealthy pay their fair share.
I reduced the deficit, as I said, 1.1$1.7 trillion in my first 2 years without raising a cent in raising taxes above anyone making less than $400,000.
The economy is growing. The only way to move forward is with a bipartisan agreement. And I believe we will come to an agreement that allows us to move forward and that protects the hard-working Americans of this country. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Nomination 
Now, for the reason we're here. I'm sure you didn't come to hear that. [Laughter]
Vice President Harris, Secretary Austin, Representative Calvert, and Representative Calhounexcuse me, Calhoun is not here. McCollum. And I want to thank you all for joining us.
And, Chairman Milley, I want to start by thanking youand I really mean itfor your years of service as Chairman and for your lifetime of selfless commitment to our country.
And I also want to thank ouryour incredible wife Hollyanne and your two children, Peter and Mary. You know, your family has served alongside you every single step of the way. And our entire country is grateful.
As Chairman, you have led our military through the most complex security environment our world has faced in a long, long time. And we've strengthened our alliances, from NATO to the Indo-Pacific, and built new partnerships, like AUKUS. We've participatedwe've anticipated new threats in domains like space and cyber.
We've addressed challenges that transcend borders, and responding to global pandemics by tackling the existential threat of climate change. We've ended the longest war in American history. We've continued to take terrorists off the battlefield. And we've rallied the world to stand with the brave people of Ukraine as they defend their freedom against Russian aggression.
Thoughthrough everything, Secretary Austin and I have had candid and direct counsel. I've valued his insight. And more than that, I've truly enjoyed working with you. I trust you completely. Completely.
You've helped set our country and our military on a course that will put us in the strongest possible position to succeed in the years ahead. I'm looking forward to continuing our work together as you finish your term and prepare to pass the baton to your successor.
So today I have the honor of introducing my nominee to be the next Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Charles Q. Brown, Jr. General, welcome.
General Brown is a warrior, descended from a proud line of warriors. His father, a U.S. Army Colonel, C.Q. Brown, served in Vietnam. His grandfather, U.S. Army Master Sergeant Robert E. Brown, Jr., led a segregated unit in World War II.
And command pilot General Brown brings to this role more than 3,000 hours of flightingflying experience, including 130 combat hours. He knows what it means to be in the thick of battle and how to keep your cool when things get hard, like when your F-16 was on fire. [Laughter] And you returned to the base in Florida in 1991. C.Q. had to eject more than 300 milesat 300 miles an hour, landing in the Everglades. That's a lot of fun, huh? [Laughter]
Well, I tell you what: He was back in the cockpit the next week with a new call sign, ""Swamp Thang."" [Laughter] New call sign. I asked him inside the Oval what it was like. But I'll tell you about that later. [Laughter]
General Brown is also a warfighter who has commanded in Europe, the Middle East, and Indoand the Indo-Pacific. And he has an unmatched firsthand knowledge of our operational theaters and a strategic vision to understand how they all work together to ensure the security for the American people.
And while General Brown is a proud, butt-kicking American airman, first and always he's also been an operational leader of the joint force. He gained respect across every service from those who have seen him in action and have come to depend on his judgment. More than that, he gained the respect of our allies and partners around the world, who regard General Brown as a trusted partner and a top-notch strategist.
No matter how complicated the mission, from helping build and lead the coalition now of more than 80 nations strong to counter ISIS threats in the Middle East, to positioning our Air Force for the future in Indoin the Indo-Pacific, General Brown has built a reputation across the force as an unflappable and highly effective leader; as someone who creates an environment of teamwork, trust and then executes with excellence; and someone who smokes a mean brisket.
I understand you have that smoker still with you.
General Brown. Yes, sir. I do.
The President. You carry that around everywhere. Was it in yourI won't ask you that. [Laughter]
But General Brown has said he doesn't play for second place; he plays to win, and that's obvious. That mindset is going to be an enormous asset to me as Commander in Chief and to the United States of America as we navigate challenges of the coming years.
Over the past 3 years, as Chief of Staff of the Air Force, General Brown has become known for his signature approach: ""Accelerate change or lose."" ""Accelerate change or lose."" General, you're right on. As I've often said, our world is at an inflection point, where the decisions we make today are going to determine the course of our world for decades to come.
And to keep American people safe, prosperous, and secure, we have to move fast and adapt quickly. We have to maintain a combat-credible force capable of deterring or defeating any potential threat. And we have to manage our competition with China and meet the reality of renewed aggression in Europe.
And we need to make sure we retain our competitive edge in an age where emerging technologies fromtechnologies, from AI to 3-D printing could fundamentally change the character of conflict.
With General Brown as Chairman, I know I'll be able to rely on his advice as a military strategist and as a leader of military innovation, dedicated to keeping our Armed Forces the best in the world. And they are the best in the history of the world, and that's a fact.
I'll also be able to rely on him foras a thoughtful, deliberate leader who is unafraid to speak his mind, as someone who will deliver an honest message that needs to be heard and will always do the right thing when it's hard.
That's the number-one quality a President needs in a Chairman. And that's the leaderthat's the leaderthat all Americans meetmet 3 years ago when General Brown gave an unflinching video testimonial sharing his own experience of racism and his deep love of our country to which he's dedicated his entire adult life. It took real backbone, and it struck a chord not only with our military members but with Americans all across the country.
C.Q. is a fearless leader and an unyielding patriot. And that's why, 3 years ago, he was concerned by the Unitedconfirmed by the United States Senate 98 to 0. I urge the Senate to once again confirm General Brown with the samethe sameoverwhelming bipartisan support fromfor his new role as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
And I also want to recognize C.Q.'s family: his wife Sharene. She is herewould you mind standing, Sharene? I know that's embarrassing you. [Laughter] Thank you. And his sons Sean and Ross. Throughout General Brown's stellar career in the Air Force, C.Q. and Sharene have always put family first. And they both know from their own experience growing up in military families that it's not just the person who wears the uniform who serves, the whole familythe whole familyserves, and the whole family sacrifices on behalf of the Nation.
Sharene, you and C.Q. are true partners in our dedication to the health and well-being of the women and men in uniform and their families: ""Five Thrive""""Five and Thrive"" initiative that's doing important work to address the greatest issues affecting military families: childcare, education, spousal employment, health care, and housing.
And I know that Jill and I look forward to working even more closely with you on these issues through her Joining Forces initiative.
Let me close with this. This year will mark the 75th anniversary of an integrated force and the 75th anniversary of women serving in the force and the 50th anniversary of the All-Volunteer force. We're celebrating the root of our national strength, the most American of ideas, the most self-evident truth: that all women and men are created equal.
And that nono more powerful testament to this than the Armed Forces of the United States of America. The steps we've taken over the decades to harness the full diversity of our Nation have grown our Armed Forces into the greatest fighting forceand I'll say it again a second timethe greatest fighting force in the history of the world.
And, General Brown, you've been an essential leader in making our Nation and our force even stronger.
You've made history. And you have even made it as a Jeopardy clue. [Laughter] Did you know that? [Laughter] You made it as a Jeopardy Clue, the Daily Double no less. [Laughter]
Well[laughter]so, thank you, General Brown and Sharene and the whole family, for being willing to take on this mission. And I can thank no one better suitedthink of no one better suited or more qualified to lead our force through the challenges and responsibility ahead.
And I look forward to having you at my side, advising me as the next Chairman and helping keep the American people safe.
And thank you all, and I thank all the military in the audience here. Thank you for your service, and thank your families as well. And may God protect our troops.
Thank you. Congratulations.

The President. Before I beginwell, I'm beginning, butI realize this is a really tough day for all the families. Remembering is important, but it's also painful.
One year ago today, Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, turned into another killing field in America.
A few days later, Jill and I traveled there and stood before those 21 crosses that were outside the school. On each cross, a namelike in these candles behind usof 19 children9, 10, 11 years oldand 2 devoted educators, and 17 more injured. We spent hours with the grieving families who were broken and never, ever will quite be the same.
To the families of the children and the educators whowe know that, 1 year later, it's still so raw for you. A year of missed birthdays and holidays, school plays, soccer games, just that smile. A year of everyday joys gone forever: the bend of his smile, the perfect pitch of her laugh.
At a vigil a few months later, one of the moms said: ""When I lay in bed and turn on my side, envisioning her staring back at me, I want so badly to be part of an alternative reality that just doesn't exist. This is my reality, because my 10-year-old daughter was murdered in her fourth-grade classroom.""
Standing there in Uvalde, Jill and I couldn't help but think that too many schools, too many everyday places have become killing fields in communities all acrossevery part of America. And in each place, we hear the same message: Do something. For God's sake, please do something.
We did something afterwards, but not nearly enough. We still need to ban, in my view, AR-15 firearms and assault weapons once again. You know, they've been used time and again in mass killings of innocent children and peoples.
We need to ban high-capacity magazines, the ability to shoot 20, 30, 40, 60 bullets without reloading. Because today, guns remain the number-one killerthe number-one killerof children in America. Guns. And over the last year since Uvalde, our country has experienced a staggering 650 mass shootings and well overit's hard to saywell over four40,000 deaths due to gun violence.
We can't end this epidemic until Congress passes some commonsense gun safety laws that keep weapons of war off our streets and out of the hands of dangerous people, until States do the same thing.
How many more parents will live their worst nightmare before we stand up to the gun lobby to establish universal background checks, establish a national ""red flag"" laws, require safe storage of storage of firearms, and end immunity from liability for gun manufacturers? The only major corporate entities that doesn't havethat's immune to liability.
Even a majority of responsible gun owners support these commonsense actions to save lives and keep our communities safe. So it's time to act. It's time to act. It's time to make our voices heard, not as Democrats or as Republicans, but as friends, as neighbors, as parents, as fellow Americans. And I'm being deadly earnest when I say that.
You know, I know, for a long time it's been hard to make progress. But there will come a point where our voices are so loud, our determination so clear that we can no longer be stopped. We will act.
You know, a year ago, after visiting the school, that same day, we attended mass at Sacred Heart Catholic Church. In the pews, families and friends held each other tightly. As the Archbishop spoke, he asked the children in attendance to come up on the altar and sit with him as he spoke on the altar.
And there wasn't enough room for everybody to go up on the altar, so a mom and her young son sat next to us. They had us in the first pew, and they sat next to us. As we left the church, a grandmother, who had just lost her granddaughter, came up to us and quietly passed us a note, a handwritten letter.
And here's what it read: ""Erase the invisible line that is dividing our Nation. Come up with a solution and fix what's broken and make the changes that are necessary to prevent this from happening again.""
My fellow Americans, you knowyou'veyou can byyou can almost feel the pain, for we've lostwe've lost children. We have to do this to save our children. For the Nation we love, to erase that invisible line.
Jill and I stand here today as, earlier this morning, we were talking about planning a memorial service this weekend celebrating the anniversary of the death of our son Beau.
Well, guess what? While everyone's pain is different. We, like many of you, have some understanding what it's like to lose a child on more than one occasion.
For those who have lost a loved one in Uvaldeto the moms, the dads, the brothers, the sisters, and grandmoms, the grandpops, this is what I know: One, they'll never be gone from your heart. They'll always be part of you.
And I know this as well, as unbelievable as it sounds, I promise you, a day will come when you pass that ice cream store or you pass that park, you pass that thing that brings back the memory of your son or daughter. It's going to bring a smile to your lips when you think of them before it brings a tear to your eye.
That's when you know you're going to make it.
And our prayer for you, from the bottom of our heart, is that day come sooner than latersooner than later. But, God willing, it will come. As I said, that's when you know you're going to make it.
God bless those 21 blessed souls lost on this day in Uvalde, and may God bless their families. We're thinking of you.
Q. Any update on the debt talks, Mr. President, please?

2023-05-22 00:00:00,Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Speaker of the House of Representatives Kevin O. McCarthy To Discuss the Public Debt Limit and an Exchange With Reporters,"
The President. Everybody in? Okay. Well, I'm glad the Speaker is here today. We're optimistic we may be able to make some progress because we've both agreed that wedefault is not really on the table; we've got to get something done here.
And the consequence of failing to pay our bills would be the American people would have a real kick in their economic well-being. As a matter of fact, the rest of the world would too. [Laughter]
And so we also agree we need to reduce the deficit. And I might add, in my first 2 years as President, I reduced it by $1.7 trillion. It matters. And so I'm all for reducing and continuing to reduce the deficit.
Andbut we allwe both talked about the need for bipartisan agreement. We have to be in a position where we can sell it to our constituencies. We're pretty well divided in the House, almost down the middle, and it's not any different in the Senate. So we've got to get something we can sell to both sides.
And we need to cut spending, but wehere's the disagreement: We have toI think we should be looking at tax loopholes and making sure the wealthy pay their fair share. I think revenue matters as well asas long as you're not taxing anybody under 400,000 bucks.
And so we're going towe still have some disagreements, but I think we may be able to get where we have to go. We both know we have a significant responsibility.
With that, I'm going to turn it over to the Speaker. Kevin, it's all yours.
Speaker McCarthy. Well, I thank the President for spending time. We had a very productive conversation yesterday, even though he was coming back from the G-7 meeting.
We do have disagreements. I think we hadof a 50-year average, we're having more revenue than any time coming in. But I think we both agree that we need to change trajectory, that our debt is too large. And I think, at the end of the day, we can find common ground, make our economy stronger, take care of this debt, but more importantly, get this Government moving again to curb inflation, make us less dependent upon China, and make our appropriations system work when we get done, right?
The President. I'm all for making appropriations work[laughter]now that I don't have to be there to do it.
Federal Budget Negotiations 
Q. Mr. President, is overall spending the way to resolve this, to agree on that kind of number?
The President. Not alone. Not that alone. [Laughter] You're a brave man. [Inaudible]getting up.

2023-05-21 00:00:00,"The President's News Conference in Hiroshima, Japan","
The President. Please have a seat. I don't think there's enough press here. [Laughter]
Well, good evening, everyone. Before turning to the important work we accomplished here at the G-7, I want to take a few minutes addressing the budget negotiations that I'm heading back home to deal with.
Before I left for this trip, I met with all four congressional leaders, and we agreed the only way to move forward was on a bipartisan agreement.
And we'veI've done my part. We put forward a proposal that cuts spending by more than a trillion dollars and on top of the nearly $3 trillion in deficit reduction that I previously proposed through the combination of spending cuts and new revenues. Now it's time for the other side to move theirfrom their extreme positions, because much of what they've already proposed is simply, quite frankly, unacceptable.
And so let me be clear: I'm not going to agree to a deal that protects, for example, a $30 billion tax break for the oil industry, which made $200 billion last yearthey don't need an incentive of another $30 billionwhile putting health care of 21 million Americans at risk by going after Medicaid.
I'm not going to agree to a deal that protects $200 billion in excess payments for pharmaceutical industries and refusing to count that while cutting over 100,000 schoolteachers and assistants' jobs, 30,000 law enforcement officers' jobs cut across the entire United States of America.
And I'm not going to agree to a deal that protects wealthy tax cheats and crypto traders while putting food assistance at risk for nearly a hundredwhy, excuse menearly 1 million Americans.
And it's time for Republicans to accept that there is no bipartisan deal to be made solelysolelyon their partisan terms. They have to move as well.
All four congressional leaders agree with me that default is notlet me say it againdefault is not an option. And I expect each of theI expect each of these leadersexcuse me
[At this point, the President cleared his throat.]
to live up to that commitment. America has never defaultednever defaultedon our debt, and it never will.
The Speaker and I will be talking later on the plane as we head back, because it's, what, 5 or 6, 7 o'clock in the morning there. And our teams are going to continue working.
Now, we've had awe've had a packed few days here at Hiroshima and, I think, with very productive and important meetings at the G-7 summit.
We also held the Quad meeting here in Hiroshima, rather than Australia, and important bilateral discussions with Prime Minister Kishida of Japan, Prime Minister Albanese of Australia, and President Zelenskyy of Ukraine, as well as the Prime Minister of India.
This is my third trip to the Indo-Pacific as President, and I look forward to rescheduling my stops in Papua New Guinea and Australia later. I've spoken with the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, and Secretary Blinken is traveling there to meet with the Pacific Island partners at that moment.
And I've alsogoing to be hostingand I've spoken with the Prime Ministerhosting the leaders of the Pacific Island Forum in Washington this fall, because I was unable to make it to Papua New Guinea. And Prime Minister Albanese, we're going to have a state visit later this year.
And I also want to thank President [Prime Minister; White House correction] Kishida for his outstandingand I'm notit's not hyperbolehis outstanding leadership of the G-7 this year, as well as Mrs. Kishida and the entire Japanese Government for the hospitality they've shown to Jill and myself and our whole team.
Being in this city and visiting the memorial on Friday was a powerful reminder of the devastating reality of nuclear war and our shared responsibility to never cease our efforts to build for peace. And together, with the leaders of the G-7, we have reiterated our commitment to continuing to work toward a world free from the threat of nuclear weapons.
Overthe past few days have showcased the unitythe unity of purposeamong the G-7. It's a very different organization than it was 5, 7, 10 years ago, because we're addressing the challenges that matter most to the world.
We're united in our efforts to strengthen global health security, and yesterday I announced that the United States plans to contribute another $250 million to the Pandemic Fund at the World Bank to make sure the world is better prepared to prevent, detect, and respond to future pandemics.
We're united in our commitment to climate action and accelerating the transition to a global clean energy economy by investing in the industries of the future.
We're united in our push to build a more resilient and inclusive global economy that can better withstand the kinds of shocks that we've experienced over the last few years, including by building a more secure and more diversified supply chain.
Through the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, which we launched last year at the G-7 summit in Germany, we've addressed the infrastructure needs that are holding back too many low- and moderate-income countries, particularly in the Global South.
The United States has already mobilized more than $30 billion in PGII projects around the globe, a significant step toward our collective pledge of the G-7 to mobilize $600 billion in investment by 2027. And we resolved to reform the multilateral development banks to give them more flexibility and better able fight poverty by helping respond to global challenges.
Now, we're also united in our approach to the People's Republic of China, and the joint statement released yesterday outlines the shared principles we've all agreed at the G-7 and beyond in dealing with China. We're not looking to decouple from China, we're looking to de-risk and diversify our relationship with China.
That means taking steps to diversify our supply chains, and we're notso we're not dependent on any one country for necessary product. It means resisting economic coercion together and countering harmful practices that hurt our workers. It means protecting a narrow set of advanced technologies critical for our national security. And those elements are all agreed on by the G-7.
Finally, joined here in Hiroshima by President Zelenskyy, and the G-7 reaffirmed our shared and unwaveringlet me say it againour shared and unwavering commitment to stand with the brave people of Ukraine as they defend themselves against Russia's brutal war of aggression and the war crimes being committed. Together with our partner countries, we reiterated a need for a just peace that respects Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, both core principles of the U.N. Charter. Russia started this war, and Russia could end it today by withdrawing its troops from Ukraine internationally recognized borders and ceasing its assault.
Until thenexcuse methe abilityUkraine's ability to defend itself is essential to being able to end this war permanently and through diplomacy. You know, and this morning I once more shared and assured President Zelenskyy, together with all G-7 members and our allies and partners around the world, that we will not waver. Putin will not break our resolve, as he thought he could 2 years agoalmost 3 years ago.
We're going to continue to provide economic, humanitarian, and security assistance to Ukraine so it can stand strong as long as it needs it. And today the United States announced our latest tranche of artillery, ammunition, antitank weapons, and bridging equipment to help Ukraine succeed in the battlefield.
You know, in my private meeting with President Zelenskyy after the G-7 meeting and with his staff, I told him the United States, together with our allies and partners, is going to begin training Ukrainian pilots in fourth-generation fighter aircraft, including F-16s, to strengthen Ukraine's Air Force as part of a long-term commitment to Ukraine's ability to defend itself.
We provided, the last year, all that they needed to deal with what they were dealing with at the moment, and that's whatand now we're moving in the direction of putting them in a position to be able to bedefend themselves in ways beyond what they've had to deal with so far.
The past few days have once more underscored how important America's global leadership is. A presumptuous thing for an American President to say, but I think you'll find, if you ask if any of our colleagues, it's true.
The security and prosperity of the American people are substantially increased by working in concert with our closest allies and partners to build a future of greater economic strength and resilience and a world that is more peaceful and stable.
And on many of the issues that matter to the American peopleaccelerating our clean energy transition, preventing another pandemic, dealing with China, standing up for Ukrainethe meetings I've had with my fellow G-7 leaders have left us more united, more resolved, and more determined to set up for the greater progress in the months ahead. And this has been an extremely significant and important summit.
With that, I'm going to take some questions. And Trevor [Trevor Hunnicutt], of Reuters.
Federal Budget Negotiations/Tax Code Reform 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You spoke a moment ago about what you won't do in terms of your negotiations with Republicans. But I'm interested in what you've signaled you already might do. In particular, by conceding in these negotiations to some form of a cap or freezing spending, are you concerned that Mr. McCarthy has already forced you into accepting a policy position that could tip this economy into a recession?
The President. No, I don't believe that's the case at all. As a matter of fact, I think that we can reach an agreement. As I've told youand you may be aware or you've seen itwe have provided for a proposal that would cut a trillion dollars off the baseline spent from the year before by just agreeing to deal with what was initially offered.
And secondly, we're in a situation where thelet me put it this way: If you all were doing your budget at home, and you said, ""Okay, we have to make some cuts,"" would you only look at the spending or would you also look at your incomewhat was coming in the doorto determine what you could afford?
And so part of what I've been arguing from the beginning is a need to consider the tax structure as well asas well ascutting spending. I'm willing to cut spending, and I proposed cuts in spending of over a trillion dollars.
But I believe we have to also look at the tax revenues. The idea that themy Republican colleagues want to continue the $2 trillion tax cut that had profound negative impacts on the economy from the Trump administration. The fact that they arewe've provided for the number ofwe got a lot of input from serious economists and former administration officials in both parties that we need more people who are qualified to be able to look at the tax returns of the thousand billionaires in Americavery complicated stuff.
It's estimated that if we had the appropriate number of tax personnel, that we would save somewhere betweenwe would generate somewhere between $200 billion and $400 billion in tax revenue.
And there's a lot of otherfor example, the idea that we'rein terms of taxesthat they refuse tofor example, weI was able to balance the budget and pass everything from the global warming billanyway, I was able to cut, by $1.7 billion [trillion; White House correction] in the first 2 years, the deficit that we were accumulating.
Andbecause I was able to say, too, that the 55 corporations in America that made forty$400 billionor $40 billion$400 billionthat theythey pay zero in tax. Zero. And so we said, ""You've got to pay a minimum of 15 percent taxes."" What a horrible thing. You're paying more than 15 percent in taxes, every one of you out there.
And so guess what? We not only balanced the budget; we were able to reduce the deficit by $1.7 billion [trillion; White House correction]. And so there's a lot of things that they refuse to look at in terms of tax generation as well as what kind of people we're going to increase taxes for.
And like I said, we're now down towe went from somewhereroughly 740 billionaires to about 1,000 billionaires in America. They're paying an average tax rate of 8 percent. Raise your hand if you want to pay 8 percent only. I think you'd all be ready to do that.
So my point is that there's a lot of things that they refuse to entertain, and they just said revenue is off the table. Well, revenue is not off the table. And so that's what I continuewe continue to have a significant disagreement on, on the revenue side.
National Economy/The President's Economic Agenda/Federal Budget Negotiations 
Q. But you don't think the spending cuts themselves will cause a recession?
The President. I know they won't. I know they won't.
Matter of fact, the fact that we were able to cut Government spending by $1.7 trillion, that didn't cause a recession; that caused growth. Look, we have the lowest unemployment rate in over 50 years. We've created 12-pointI think it's7 million new jobs, including 800,000 manufacturing jobs. We have moved in a direction where we're rebuilding and reconstructing America through the infrastructure act.
Look, here's the other thing. I'm sureI'm not sure; my guess is, I'll get a question about, you know, ""Well, wait a minute, you know, the American people aren't satisfied."" Well, guess what? As I've told you all before, most of thiswhat we've passeddoesn't kick init only kicks in over time. And so the fact is, for example, that if you're in a situation where you wereI'll give you the one example that I've usedeverybody understands the easiestis insulin.
Well, I decided that we were going to be in a position where we were not going to continue to pay the highest drug prices in the world. And that's what we do, by the way. Same manufacturer of a drug in the United States, selling it here in Japan, selling it in Tokyo, or selling it in Berlin, or selling it around the world, they pay a lot less than we pay at home.
So we said a simple proposition: Let's take a look at how much it costs to make the product. And I'm not going to ask you toa show of hands like I do in a town meeting, but ifI usually ask, ""How many people know somebody who has type 1 or type 2 diabetes?"" And I'm almostat least half the audience raises their hand.
Well, they were paying somewhere between $4- and $700 a month for their insulin that they badly need to stay healthy and alive. Well, guess what? It costs $10t-e-n$10 to make. To package, total amount, you could argue maybe as much as $13.
Well, guess what? Now they can't charge more forMedicare can't, because Medicare is payingtaking American tax dollars and paying for the elderly's health care needs. You can't charge more than $35 for that drug. That saves $160 billion. Hear it? A hundred and sixty billion dollars less will be paid out by the Federalby the American taxpayer to help the elderly people on Medicare with a problem.
Well, a lot of this is just kicking in. We're in a situation where next year, for the drug costs, no senior will have to paytotal costtotal cost of all the drugs, from expensive cancer drugs to whatever drugs they're taking, will not have to pay more than $3,500 a year. The following yearwe've already passed this. This is the law now. The following year, they won't have to pay more than $2,000. That saves another $200 billion that we're paying out.
But the other team won't count this. Even though it's the lawwe passed itthey won't count that as reducing the debt.
So there's a lot of those kinds of disagreements we have. And my guess is that I'm going to be talking to the Speaker of the House on the way back on the plane, because it will be morning time overat home. And I'm going to be in that plane in about an hour or so. And my guess is, he's going to want to deal directly with me in making sure we're all on the same page.
But it's probably more than you wanted to know.
How about Masaru, NHK [Masaru Takagi; NHK World].
China/Japan/South Korea/Quadrilateral Security Dialogue Nations 
Q. Hi. Good evening, Mr. President. The Chinese military is more active at this time in the Taiwan Strait, with expectations this might increase leading up to Taiwan's Presidential election next January. Despite some, you know, diplomatic communication recently between the U.S. and China, the military hotline is not working.
Under this circumstance, how will you manage the diplomatic, you know, relationship with China? And how will you strengthen the U.S. alliance with Japan and R.O.K. in order to counter China? Thank you.
The President. Well, number one, you're right, we should have an open hotline. At the Bali conference, that's what President Xi and I agreed we were going to do and meet on. And then this silly balloon that was carrying two freight cars' worth of spying equipment was flying over the United States, and it got shot down, and everything changed in terms of talking to one another. I think you're going to see that begin to thaw very shortly. But in the meantime, what's happened is: I think it's fair to say, for those of you who have dealt with the Japanese Government and reported from here for a long time, the situation in terms of our relations with Japan have never, ever, ever in American history been stronger. Never. Never.
And we started this relationship when I came to seesome of you were with me on my first trip herewhen I came to see President [Prime Minister; White House correction] Kishida's predecessor and made the case that what was happening in Europe was the smallthe world is getting smaller.
What's happening in Europe and the invasion of Ukraine is, it affects everyone, including people here in the Pacific basin. And so we've ended up where you have Japan stepping up in a way that's of real consequence, in terms of your defense budget, number one, and a beginning of a rapprochement with South Korea.
I've spoken at length with President Loon [Yoon; White House correction] of South Korea. He came to Washington of late. He's agreedwe're all of the same agreementthat, in fact, we are not going towe're maintainingwe all agree we're going to maintain the ""one China"" policy, which sayseverybody kind of forgetsI mean, you all know it, but the public kind of forgets that it says that neither country, JapanI mean, China or Taiwanneither territory can independently declare what they're going to do. Period. There has to be a mutually agreed-to outcome.
And so we're sticking by that. We're not going to tell China what they can do. We made it clear that we don't expectwe don't expect Taiwan to independently declare independence either.
But in the meantime, we're going to continue to put Taiwan in a position that they can defend themselves. And there is clear understanding among most of our allies that, in fact, if China were to act unilaterally, there would be a response. There would be a response.
But Iso I don't think there's anything inevitable about the notion that there's going to be this conflict between the United States and the West and/or Japan and Korea and the Quad.
And if you take a look at what's happened, we are more secure, with all the talk about China's building its militaryit is building its military, and that's why I've made it clear that I am not going to prepareI'm not prepared to trade certain items with China.
And when I was asked by President Xi why, I said, ""Because you're using them to build nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, and I'm not going to do it."" And we've now got commitment from all of our allies, they're not going to either provide that kind of material that allows them to do that.
But that's not a hostile act. That's an act that says we're going to make sure that we do everything we can to maintain the status quo ante.
And what's going on now is thelook at the meeting we had here today and yesterday of the Quad. I'll bet youI wouldmaybe some of you thought it, but I doubt many people in this audience or any other audience would have said that 2 years after being elected, I'd be able to convince India, Australia, Japan, and the United States to form an organization called the Quad to maintain stability in the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea.
Well, when asked by the Prime Ministerby President Xi why we're doing that, I said: ""Simple: We haveinternational organizations have agreed upon what constitutes open airspace and sea space. And we're not going to allow that to be unilaterally altered. Period."" We're not changing any rules, we're just making sure that we unite democracies in the conviction that the Pacific basin remains what it was before: open and clear. So I guess what I'm saying isI don't ""guess"" what I'm sayingwhat I'm trying to say is, I think we're more united than we've ever beenever beenin the Pacific, in terms of maintaining stability and maintaining a sense of security.
So I'm not sure that answers your question, but I hope it does. If it doesn't, you want to follow up with any portion of that question?
Q. [Inaudible]
The President. Well, how aboutif you don't want to follow up, how about Annmarie [Annmarie Hordern] of Bloomberg TV and Radio?
China/Federal Budget Negotiations 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You just said, ""I'm willing to cut spending."" Speaker McCarthy says that the U.S. Government needs to spend less next year than they did this year. So will you agree to that?
And on China, your team has been trying to secure meetings with their Chinese counterparts. Would you consider easing some sanctions to improve relations, like the sanctions that are currently on China's Defense Minister? Thank you.
The President. Yes and no. No, I'm not going to ease the sanctions. But yes, I think we shouldon the front end of your question is that wethere's a lot that is going on relative to spending. And we have agreed to cut spending. We've cut spending, and we're going to continue to cut spending.
But the question is: What base do you start from? Initially, if you remember, when the Republicans introduced theirwhen the Speaker, by, I guess, a four- or five-vote majority, was able to pass hiswhat he callsextending the debt with a limitation on howwhat you had to do to extend it, in terms of the budget side. I said, I'm not going to negotiate on whether to extend the debt. I will negotiate on a budget.
On the budget side of the equation, they came along and said, initiallyit was hard to determine where they are, quite frankly; and, I don't know, you all may know more from questioning them than I do. But they just came along and said, ""We're going to move off of the 2023 budget, and that's the baseline we're going to use for the next 2 yearsthat budget."" And I said, ""Well, what about what you all just voted on after the budget, which was the add-on money that you all agreed to and the House and Senate voted for?"" And they said, ""Well, that includes that as well.""
I said, ""Okay, well, then we may be able to work on something."" So we started calculating what that would mean, in terms ofit came to a 22-percent cut for everything in the budget but the things that have already been passedthe five big initiatives that I've already passed, in terms of infrastructure, the Affordable Care Act, et cetera.
But, in the meantime, what happened is thatthat seems to be changing. They said, ""Well, we're going to exempt""remember we said that, well, you're going to cut veterans because 20[inaudible]said everythingthat's discretionary budget. They said, ""No, we're not going to cut veterans."" Okay, that's good.
And weinitially, when they started off, they were going to cut Medicare and Medicaid. They said, ""Whoa, whoa, no."" I mean, not Medicaid; Social Security and Medicare. They said, ""No, no, no, no."" The first time I ever had a negotiation in the State of the Union message.
But they said, ""No, we're not going to cut that."" Okay, well, that's offoff the radar. ""What else is off the radar?"" And they named some other things. And I said, ""Well, that means if you want to get the number you wanted from freezing the budget at 2023, plus the additions you added, then it means you're going to go from 22 percentyou're going to end up cutting 30 percent or 35 percent discretionary budget.""
For example, if you calculate what they're talking about, you're going to losethey're going to lose 100,000 teachers and assistants. They're going to lose thousands of police officers across the board. I mean, just calculate what it means if you take all discretionary spending and you make no distinctions other than what the percentage number of the cut is. And some of it makes absolutely no sense at all.
And so what we've done is: We're going to have to sit downand I'm hoping thatthat Speaker McCarthy is just waiting to negotiate with me when I get home, which has beenI don't know whether that's true or not; we'll find out.
But at first, we weren't making progress. Then we made a lot of progress. And then, all of a sudden, they came back with a proposal that was very cut back from where they had agreed or discussed. And now I don't know where wewe gave a counterproposal to the counter againand I know this sounds ridiculous, but that's what we didand I'm waiting to hear their response to what we have offered.
We are willing to cut spending, as well as raise revenue so people start paying their fair share. Again, if this were a town meeting, I'd ask, ""Raise your hand if you think the tax structure is fairremotely fair. What do you think?""
Anyway. So that's the context.
China 
Q. And, on China, you will not lift sanctions on China's Defense Minister? Because Lloyd Austin was trying to meet with him, but he's currently sanctioned by the U.S. Government.
The President. No, I know that. That's under negotiation right now. I thought you said would I lift sanctions on material I was going to sendsell their defense department, meaning would I sell somethe answer to that's under discussion.
Jim Tankersley, New York Times.
Q. Hi. Mr. President, thank you.
The President. Oh.
Public Debt Limit/The President's Executive Authorities 
Q. You speak a lot at these summits about the power of democracies to solve big problems. But I'm curious, in these meetings with world leaders, how are you explaining the possibility that American democracy could cause a global financial crisis if the debt limit is breached next month? And I'm wondering if you are offering them assurances that, whether it's by invoking the 14th Amendment or anything else, you will take whatever steps you need to make sure that doesn't happen.
The President. First of all, it would be a very serious circumstance if we didn't pay our debt for the first time in 230 years. That would be a serious problem.
So far, there's been very little discussionand they all know what's going onabout whether or not we're going to default on our debt. Numberno, number two.
Number three, I can't guarantee that they wouldn't force a default by doing something outrageous. I can't guarantee that. Number four, I'm looking at the 14th Amendment, as to whether or not we have the authority. I think we have the authority. The question is: Could it be done and invoked in time that it could notwould not be appealed and, as a consequence, pass the date in question and still default on the debt. That's a question that I think is unresolved.
And so the point is, I thinkI'm hoping and I believe that when we stood in thatwhen we sat in the room with all the leaders, from Mitch McConnell on, and they said: ""We will not default. Period. We will not default."" That's what all, including Kevin McCarthy, said. ""We will not default.""
And so I'm assuming that we mean what we say, and we'll figure out a way to not have to default.
Elizabeth Palmer, CBS News.
White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. This is the last question, sir.
Q. Good afternoon
The President. Hey.
Ukraine/U.S. Security Assistance 
Q. Mr. President. What has President Zelenskyy told you about the big counteroffensive? And maybe you can start by telling us whether it's actually underway or not.
And also, I'd like to ask you about the F-16s. You've greenlit them now. Jake Sullivan said arms and equipment go to Ukraine according to what he called the ""exigencies of the conflict."" So what exigency now exists that didn't exist that demands these planes?
The President. Well, I'll tell you exactly when they're going to move, exactly where they're going to go. He told me[laughter]come on. God love you. I'm going toeven if I knew precisely, you think I'm going to tell you what they're going to do in terms of their offensive?
Q. We[inaudible]hope.
The President. Well, I hope you hope I wouldn't do that, because that would mean it wouldn't succeed.
But the fact is that we did discuss privately with ZelenskyyI did discuss with Zelenskyy howlet me put it this way: We and our NATO allies know how many brigades they have trained, know what the status of those brigades are, and have an expectation as to what their likelihood of succeeding are.
We don't know that for certain. War is uncertain. War is uncertain, to state the obvious. So, and myit will proceed. I can'tifeven if II think I do know, but I'm not going to tell you because that would not be a smart thing to do either.
So, having said that, the expectation and hope is that they will be successful in that it will make it clear to Russia that the costfor example, Bakhmut: Bakhmut is a discussion about whether or not it's been lost or whatever. And well, the truth of the matter is, the Russians have suffered over 100,000 casualties in Bakhmut. That's hard to make up. That's hard to make up.
So, whether or not there isthere are troops in Bakhmut occupyingthere's not many buildings left standing in Bakhmut. It's a pretty devastated city. But they have been able to move in a direction that they've been able to lock down an awful lot of the Russian forces, including the Wagner Group. So, with regard to the F-16s, F-16s would not have helped in that regard at all. It was unnecessary. For examplelet's take just Bakhmut, for examplewould not have anyany additional added consequence.
But what's happened is: Since the provision of everything from the significant missile defense systems, tanks, sophisticated tanks and the likeall the things that were of consequence in the near term in the Donbas area and where the fighting was taking placethey now have all that equipment. There's a little bit still coming, but they have all that equipment.
What's going to happen, though, is if they continue to do well, they're going to be in a situation where you're going to have the Russians being able to stand off at a greater distance for maintaining their headquarters and other things, which are out of range of certainof the existing capacity they have. And they have to be able to be in a position where now those fighter jets, those F-16s, make a big difference in terms of being able to deal with what is coming down the road.
And, God willingand we don't know thisif they're successful and there ends up being an accommodation where there is not a cease-fire, but there is a peace agreement that gets worked out, that they'll have the capacity to have confidence in their ability to resist response by the Russians if they were to change their position.
So that's the essence of the difference. Did youwas there another part of the question?
U.S. Security Assistance to Ukraine 
Q. No, but I have one. And that is, you do expect these F-16s to take part in this conflict?
The President. No. Not the perceptionI don't expect the F-16s to take part in the existinglet's assume that it's not, but let's assume tomorrow the offensive was startingor in a week, or 2 or 5 or 7 or 10. It's nothighly unlikely they would take place in that context.
But it will take place in the contextif they're successful in the near term, they're going to then continue to have to fight with the Russians, who have headquarters beyond where they are now not able to be reached by the existing capacity that exists in their arsenal. So it's a different need, just like the tanks weren't needed in the beginning, but they're needed now. And so that's the nature of the change.
U.S. Security Assistance to Ukraine 
Q. Mr. President, what assuranceswhat assurances do youwhat assurances do you have that providing F-16s won't escalate this war?
The President. I have a flat assurance from thefrom Zelenskyy that they will notthey will not use it to go on and move into Russian geographic territory. But wherever Russian troops are within Ukraine in the area, they would be able to do that.
Thank you all very, very much. Appreciate it.
Q. Mr. President, one more on the
Russia/U.S. Security Assistance to Ukraine 
Q. How do you respond to the Kremlin calling this a ""colossal risk,"" Mr. President?
The President. It is for them.
Public Debt Limit 
Q. And, Mr. President, on the debt limit, you said already, ""I've done"" Q. Can you speak to your experience
Q. ""I've done my part."" Do you think that if there is a breach, nobody is going to blame you?
The President. Of course, no one would blame me. I know you won't. You'll be saying, ""Biden did a wonderful job."" [Laughter] I know you.
Q. I'm asking: Would you be blameless in a default situation?
The President. On the merits based on what I've offered, I would be blameless. On the politics of it, no one would be blameless. And by the way, that's one of thethat's one of the things that some are contemplating.
I actually hadwell, I've got to be careful here. I think there are some MAGA Republicans in the House who know the damage that it would do to the economy. And because I am President, and Presidents are responsible for everything, Biden would take the blame. And that's the one way to make sure Biden is not reelected.
Thank you.
Press Secretary Jean-Pierre. Thank you, everybody.
Public Debt Limit 
Q. Mr. President, are you still weighing the 14th Amendment, or have you taken those options off the table?
Q. How would you respond to criticism that your actions and the G-7 would lead to more instability and division in the world?
Q. Sir, is a congressional deal the only option here, or are you still weighing other unilateral or executive actions?
The President. We have not come up with a unilateral action that could succeed in a matter of 2 weeks or 3 weeks. That's the issue.
Q. So it's up to lawmakers?
The President. So it's up to lawmakers. But my hope and intention is, when we resolve this problem, I'd find a rationale to take it to the courts to see whether or not the 14th Amendment is, in fact, something that would be able to stop it.
Thank you.
Press Secretary Jean-Pierre. Okay, the press conference has concluded. Thanks, everybody. Thank you, everyone.
Q. [Inaudible]the 14th Amendment?
Q. Sir, what happens to the U.S. Government if you do default?

2023-05-21 00:00:00,"Remarks Prior to a Meeting With President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine and an Exchange With Reporters in Hiroshima, Japan","
President Biden. Well, Mr. President, it's good to be here with you and your colleagues. Thanks for making the trip to Japan. And yourthe brave people of Ukraine, led by you and your colleagues here, are just a marvel to the rest of the world. I'm sure every place you go you've gotten that response. It's absolutely astounding.
And the brutality with which Putin is conducting this full-blown assault is justI don't think even 3 years ago anybody would have thought it could be anything like this.
That's why the United States continues to do all we can to strengthen Ukraine's ability to defend itself, including launching some new joint efforts with our partners to train Ukrainian pilots on a fourth-generation fighter aircraft like the F-16.
And this week, the G-7 also imposed hundreds of new sanctions and export controls against Russia's assets to ensure that we keep pressure on Putin. To hold his backers accountable for this war, these are sanctioning them as well.
And today I'm announcing the next tranche of U.S. security assistance to Ukraine, a package that includes more ammunition, artillery, armored vehicles to bolster Ukraine's battlefield abilities.
And the United States continues to help Ukraine respond, recover, and rebuild. And we're also supporting your pursuit of a just peace, just one aspect of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. It has to be nonnegotiable. It just has to happen.
So, Mr. President, what the people of Ukraine are defending, what you've achieved is a matter for the entire world to observe. And they're in awe of what you've done so far, really and truly. It's incredible.
Together, with the entire G-7, we have Ukraine's back. And I promise we're not going anywhere.
So thank you for being here.
President Zelenskyy. Thank you very much, Mr. President. First of all, thank you for your apt leadership, for your support, and really, for this new package. It's great. Thank you very much from our people.
And I'm so happy that, you know, we have so strong relations with our people, that our people during theseall these challenges, they go shoulder to shoulder. I'm very thankful to American people, to you, your team, Congress, bipartisan support.
And I'm happy that between our teams there are strong relations. There's Jake and Andriy, and Mr. Blinken and our Foreign Minister. All of youbig teamand that really help us. Thank you.
I remember your last brave, historical visit to Kyiv. And really, our society highly appreciate for this. And we spoke about very difficult decisions. And you did it with the training mission. We are very thankful. Because I think it will give us more strong positions on the battlefield. So we are very thankful that that is the new package. I really didn't know the details, but I know that you gave us a very big package during this year; it's more than $37 billion. My appreciations. We'll never forget.
Thank you very much.
President Biden. Well, you know, Isome of my staff was saying that we're supposed to be leaving, but it wasseemed to be following you when I was in Kyiv and those sirens went off that there was an air raid
President Zelenskyy. Yes.
President Biden. and we were walking through. We just kept walking. And I thought, ""Well, if he doesn't care about the sirens, I don't care about the sirens."" [Laughter] But, well, I don't know, I worried that you were going get us in trouble.
Anyway, thank you.
President Zelenskyy. Thank you.
President Biden. Thank you, everybody. Appreciate it.
Q. Mr. PresidentPresident Zelenskyy, is Bakhmut still in Ukraine's hands? The Russians say they've taken Bakhmut.
President Zelenskyy. I think no, but you have to understand that there is nothing. They've destroyed everything. There are no buildings. It's a pity. It's tragedy.
But, for today, Bakhmut is only in our hearts. There is nothing on this place, sojust ground and a lot of dead Russians. But they came to us.
So thatour defenders in Bakhmut, theythey did strong work. Theyand of course, we appreciate them for their great job.
President Biden. Thank you.
Q. President Zelenskyy, what else do you need from the United States?
Q. Mr. President, why did you change your mind on F-16's? President Biden

2023-05-20 00:00:00,"Remarks With Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, and Prime Minister Fumio Kishida of Japan at the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue Leaders Summit in Hiroshima, Japan","
Prime Minister Albanese. Well, good evening, everyone. I'm very honored to be convening the third in-person Quad leaders' summit here in Hiroshima. And I want to thank, particularly, Fumio, but also President Biden and Prime Minister Modi as well for showing how we are indeed an outcomes-focused grouping that can get things done and can be flexible[laughter]to make sure that we achieve these outcomes. [Laughter]
President Biden. Well said.
Prime Minister Albanese. It's an exampleit's an example of our resolve and also, I think, a clear statement of how important we regard the Quad as being an essential component.
My first act 1 year ago tomorrow, indeed, wasafter being sworn in as Prime Ministerwas to fly to Tokyo to represent Australia in Japan at the second Quad leaders' summit. And I will never forget the very warm and generous welcome that I had after my election. I can't think of any better way to begin a Prime Ministership than a gathering of such important friends from our region.
One year on, I'm absolutely delighted to be amongst close friends again here in Japan to continue our important work, standing together for an open, stable, secure, and prosperous Indo-Pacific region, a region where sovereignty is respected and all countries large and small benefit from a regional balance that keeps the peace.
Respect for the leadership of regional institutions, including ASEAN, the Pacific Island Forum, and the Indian Ocean Rim Association is central to our approach. And our vision statement that we will release tonight sets out the principles for our engagement in the region.
Through the Quad's positive, practical agenda, we are taking action to address shared challenges. Together, we are leveraging our collective strengths and offering support to the region, which will be enhanced by the outcomes that we hope to agree on tonight.
So thank you, everyone, for gathering. And I will now hand to Prime Minister Modi for his opening comments.
Prime Minister Modi. Your Excellencies, Prime Minister Albanese, Prime Minister Kishida, and President Biden: I am very pleased to be taking part in this Quad summit today and to be among friends. The Quad group has established itself as an important platform for peace, stability, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific.
There is no doubt at all about the fact that the Indo-Pacific region is the engine for global trade, innovation, and development. We agree that the security and success of the Indo-Pacific is important not just for this region, but for the entire world. We are moving forward with a constructive agenda based on shared democratic values.
Through our shared efforts, we are giving a practical dimension to our vision for a free, open, and inclusive Indo-Pacific. Climate action, disaster management, strategic technologies, reliable supply chains, health security, maritime security, counterterrorism are examples of areas in which our positive cooperation is increasing.
Today, several countries and groups are announcing the Indo-Pacific strategicstrategy and vision. During our meeting today, we will have the opportunity to discuss subjects related to the inclusive and people-centric development of this entire region.
I believe that Quad will continue to work for global good, for the welfare of mankind, and for peace and prosperity. I commend and congratulate Prime Minister Albanese for successfully chairing this summit. We will be pleased to host the Quad leaders' summit in India in 2024.
Thank you.
Prime Minister Albanese. Well, thank you very much, Prime Minister Modi. I now turn to Prime Minister Kishida.
Prime Minister Kishida. Thank you, Anthony. The Chair mentioned that 1 year has passed since our summit in Tokyo. During this 1-year period, Russia's outrage has continued, and the security environment has become even more severe. Free and open international order based on the rule of law is under threat.
All the more so because we live under such harsh situation, it is meaningful that we get together to demonstrate to the world once again the solidarity of the Quad and our strong commitment to our common vision towards a free and open Indo-PacificFOIPthat we would like to drive the world towards an international community of cooperation and not of division and confrontation.
Without striving together with regional countries, FOIP cannot be attained. We will listen to the voices of regional countries of the ASEAN, South Asia, and Pacific Island states to engage in practical cooperation which delivers true benefits to the region as a force for good.
I hope today's discussion will give us another momentum to further spur our efforts.
Thank you.
Prime Minister Albanese. Thank you very much[inaudible].
President Biden. Well, gentlemen, thank you for accommodating the change of locationparticularly you, Mr. Prime Minister. [Laughter] IPrime Minister Albanese, especially for your impressive leadership of the Quad this year and your gracious flexibility in holding the meeting hereagain, in Japan.
Theyou know, while our setting today is different than ourour mission remains the same, and that is to advance our vision of a free, open, secure, and prosperous Indo-Pacific andand to demonstrate the capacity of democracies to deliverto deliveron the sharedin a shared region.
I think people are going to look back at thisthe Quad in, God willing, 10, 20, 30 years from now and say it changed the dynamic not only of the region, but the world.
And while the setting today is different, you know, in our last 2 years, we made enormous progress, in my view. We're now launching anew initiatives to keep that progress going, from projects to build secure telecommunications in the Pacific region, to strengthen our cooperation in submarine cables, new joint efforts between our private sectors to invest in infrastructure and clean energy projects in the region.
And I'm also proud thatof the work we've done with our partners of theof the ASEAN and Pacific Islands. Matter of fact, I was with one of our counterparts today at the larger meeting, andhe's part of the ASEAN countriesand he said, ""I think the Quad is a very good idea."" Remember, at the beginning, it washow it was going to be greeted.
Butand so it'sI feel good. I think a great deal of the future of our world is going to be written here in the Indo-Pacific. And together, I think we're going to continue to ensure that the future provides more opportunity, prosperity, and stability than anything else.
So I want to thank you again for your strong partnership and friendship. And I apologize again for the change in plans. But thank you for accommodating this, and I look forward to our conversations tonight.
Thank you.
Prime Minister Albanese. Thank you, Mr. President. We will now move to a closed meeting. Thank you.

2023-05-20 00:00:00,"Remarks at the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment Meeting in Hiroshima, Japan","
Well, thank you very much, Mr. Prime Minister.
Nearly 1 year ago, we made a commitment to commit not only to build a better infrastructure, but to build a better future, one rooted in opportunity, security, and prosperity for all. And thanks to all the public and private partners around this table and many more around the world, we've already begun to deliver.
Together, we've initiated quality and sustainable infrastructure projects across Africa, Asia, and the Americas. And we're strengthening our shared climate security, health security, and food security and economic security. All four are critical.
We started to engage more private investors to better de-risk and leverage additional capital. And I see at least two from the United States here that are de-risking a lot. [Laughter] And I'm proud to announce that the United States has already mobilized more than $30 billion in investments to date. And we're just getting started.
Together, we have a lot of work to do to close the infrastructure gap and forin low- and middle-income countries. And as we begin the next year, our partnershipwe need to find new waysnew ways to maximize investmentsour investments.
That's why, moving forward, the United States will enhance our focus on investing in key economic corridors. In practice, that means making game-changing investments in regions that could lead to positive impacts across multiple sectors in multiple countries.
We've already started working with our partners to make this happen. For example, in sub-Saharan Africa, the U.S. Development Finance Corporation is looking to invest in this first railway project on the continent. The rail line would extend from the western shores of Angola to the border of the D.R.C. and Zambia, with the goal of ultimately reaching the Indian Ocean, connecting the continent east to west for the first time.
This project would not only quickly promote trade and create jobs. Over time, in my view, it will strengthen supply chains, incentiveand incentivize investments in agriculture and promote food security. And it's going to enable, in my view, us to better access clean energy and digital connectivity across the entire region, creating more security, more prosperity, more opportunities for generations to come.
That's what our focus on the key economic corridors is all about: investing in near-term solutions that pay long-term dividends.
It's not only in Africa. We're starting similar work in Costa Rica, Ecuador, Indonesia, and other places I won't bore you with now.
And let me close with this. During the G-7 meeting, we're addressing a range of issues: climate change, food security, gender inequality, economic resilience, digital connectivity, and global security. We're tracking these challenges together, and I think we're beginning to make some important progress.
But if we don't move to do more to strengthen infrastructure in low- and middle-income countries, if we don't do more to help nations deliver opportunities and prosperity for their people, our impact is going to be limited. That's how thehow critical this partnership is. That's how important our investments are.
So today, as we began the PGII's second year, let's all find ways to maximize our investmentmaximize itbecause it will do a lot not only for that particular undertaking, but it has an impact across theentire regions, in my view, andto unlock even more public and private capital.
And together, let's recommit to showing that democracies can deliver. Let me say it again: Democracies can deliver. We have to deliver to people around the world.
I want to thank you all for your partnership and leadership on this vital issue.
And now I'm going to turn it back to the Prime Minister. Thank you.

President Biden. Well, Mr. Prime Minister, it's wonderful to see you. I'm sorry this meeting is not taking place in your country, Australia. And I deeply appreciate the flexibility in meeting me here at the G-7 meeting.
And that's because we've got a lot to discuss. Together, we've delivered historica historic year, the both of us. And it's between ourallegiance between Australia and the United States.
In March, in San Diego, we stood together. Prime Minister Sunak was also here, youI might add[laughter]to announce the generational commitment to a shared security through our AUKUS trilateral partnership.
Australia and the United States have stood together to defend our shared domestic values, including supporting the people of Ukraine as they defend themselves against Russia's brutal aggression. And together, we've expanded our cooperation across a range of challenges, from space to emerging technologies, while advancing our shared vision to a free, open, and secure Indo-Pacific.
And we're launching a new joint initiative to accelerate a transition to clean energy, including by building more resilient critical mineral supply chains. This is a huge step, from our perspective, a huge step forward in our fight against the climate crisis. And I want to thank you for your strong leadership and your partnership in this challenge.
I'm looking forward to our conversation today and hosting you for a official state visit this year in Washington, DC.
And again, I truly apologize to you for having you to come here, rather than me being in Australia right now. But we have a little thing going on at home I've got to pay attention to. [Laughter]
So thank you very much. And the floor is yours, sir.
Prime Minister Albanese. Well, thank you very much, Mr. President. And certainly, I understand the circumstances that led us to hold the Sydney Quad meeting in Hiroshima later this evening, but also to catch up with our bilateral that we had scheduled for a few days' time.
We appreciate the alliance as our most important relationship. And today what we've done is add a new element to that alliance up front, very clearly, unequivocally: climate action. Because climate action, of course, is a national security issue.
And it is good that we've been able to show the nature of the Quad is that it's a pragmatic gathering, which is about outcomes. And we're getting those outcomes. I'm sure we'll be successful later today. But also, we've had important outcomes with the agreement that we've just signed: the statement of intent.
And I want to say that I appreciate very much the issue that I raised with you in San Diego has been progressed reallyyour support for Congress in showing that Australia is a domestic source under the Defense Production Act. That's really important.
I went to the U.K. recently for the coronation and went up to Barrow to look at the nuclear-powered subs that are being built there. And AUKUS is progressing between our three countries as well. And it's important that we progress pillar two as part of that implementation.
I'm saddened that you are unable to come down next week, but I understand the circumstances that you're dealing with, and I would have done exactly the same thing. All politics is local, as you and I both understand.
And I look forward at some time in the future to you visiting. You would always be a very welcome visitor in Australia, as you have been in the past as Vice President.
And I'm very much looking forward to the state visit as well, as is Jodie. We're really looking forward to visiting DC and to continuing to build on the relationship that just goes from strength to strength.
President Biden. And it has. And all politics may be local, but our friendship is permanent.
Prime Minister Albanese. Absolutely.

President Biden. This compact and statement of intent are a testament to our close bilateral cooperation. And I mean that: close. We're going to establish climate and clean energy as the third pillar of the Australia-U.S. alliance.
This compact is going to enable the expansion of and diversification of clean energy supply chains, especially as it relates to critical materials.

Prime Minister Albanese. Yes. Well, thank you, Mr. President. Thank you for your leadership through the Inflation Reduction Act in the United States, but also through your leadership internationally as well, and for including Australia proudly in your Major Economies Forum that met virtually just a few weeks ago.
And Australia is back around the table. And what we know is that action on climate change, I say, is the entry fee to credibility in the Indo-Pacific.
Many of our neighbors understand that climate change is an existential threat. And what we understand is that it's an important component of our national security. And that's why it is an important componentan essential partof our alliance.

2023-05-18 00:00:00,"Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Prime Minister Fumio Kishida of Japan in Hiroshima, Japan","
Prime Minister Kishida. Joe, the last time we met in person was in January upon my visit to the U.S. And it is indeed a great pleasure to see you again in person and especially to welcome you, Joe, here in my hometown.
The Japan-U.S. alliance is the very foundation of peace and security in the Indo-Pacific. Japan and the United States have strong relationship not only in the area of security; we have close and strong cooperation in all areas. We very much welcome that the cooperation has evolved by leaps and bounds.
Here in Hiroshima, the U.S. company Micron is engaged in leading semiconductor research, development, and manufacturing. And this is a great case of Japan-U.S. semiconductor cooperation, and Japanese Government will continue to support Micron's efforts.
And based upon our vision to develop an ecosystem for innovation and startups in deep tech as we plan to create a global startup campus in central Tokyo, joint study with the Massachusetts Institute of Technologythe MIT, one of the leading universities of the United Stateshas commenced. By gaining cooperation from the United States, we will materialize such vision.
Today weJoe and Iwill go over what we intend to discuss at the G-7 Hiroshima summit and engage in last-minute coordination. And, at the summit, I am confident that the G-7 will demonstrate our unwavering will to uphold free and open international order based on the rule of law, a concept that we both share.
President Biden. Well, Mr. President [Prime Minister; White House correction], it's wonderful to see you again and here in your own hometown. Theand thank you for hosting the G-7 summit here. Tounder Japan's leadership, we've already delivered progress on the G-7 agenda this year. And I'm looking forward to our meetings in the days ahead.
As you said back in January when you were at the White House, I think the quote is: We face the mostone of the most complex environments in recent historysecurity environments. And I couldn't agree with you more.
But I'm proud that the United States and Japan are facing it together. And you know, we stand up for the shared values, including supporting the brave people of Ukraine as they defend their sovereign territory and holding Russia accountable for its brutal aggression.
And we're tracking the global challengesfrom strengthening our community and our commitment to nuclear nonproliferation, to ensuring a free and open Indo-Pacific. That's at the heart of all this.
And you know, we areit seems to me we're deepening our cooperation on emerging technologies, including new partnerships between the United States and Japanese companies and, as you mentioned, universities as well in areas like quantum computing and semiconductors. And I want to thank you for Japan's commitment to increase investment in these areas.
The bottom line, Mr. Prime Minister, is that when our countries stand together, we stand stronger. And I believe the whole world is safer when we do.
So thank you again for having me here today. And we look forward to the next several days.
Q. Mr. President, do you guarantee allies that the U.S. won't default?

2023-05-17 00:00:00,Remarks on the Public Debt Limit and an Exchange With Reporters,"
The President. Hey, everybody. Well, I'm about to take off in a few minutes, if you hear the helicopter out there, to Japannot in the helicopter, but to Andrews. Theanywayand to meet with the leaders of G-7.
America's role in the world is vital, especially right now as we work together with other countries to support Ukraine and take on the challenges that demand international cooperation, from tackling the climate crisis to strengthening the global economy.
And before I leave, I wanted to say a word about the status of negotiations with the Congressional leaders. We had a productive meeting yesterday andwith all four leaders in the Congress. It was civil and respectful, and everyone came to the meeting, I think, in good faith.
I'm confident that we'll get the agreement on the budget, that America will not default. And every leader in the room understands the consequences if we fail to pay our bills. And it would be catastrophic for the American economy and the American people if we didn't pay our bills.
And I'm confident everyone in the room agreed, with the Speakerfrom the Speaker to the majority leader to themajority leader in the House and the Senateexcuse methe majority leader in the Senate, the minority leader in the Senate, as well as the leaderthe Democratic leader in the House, that we're going to come together, because there's no alternative to do the right thing for the country. We have to move on.
And to be clear, this negotiation is about the outlines of what the budget will look like, not about whether or not we're going to, in fact, pay our debts. The leaders have all agreed we will not default. Every leader has said that.
And I'm proud of the progress my administration has made. We've reduced the deficit in the first 2 years by $1.7 trillion in the first 2 years. And I have proposed a budget that will reduce another $3 trillion over the next decade. That includes more revenue by asking the wealthy and large corporations to begin to pay their fair share and cutting subsidies that exist in the law now to Big Oil and Big Pharma.
Yesterday we all agreed that both the Speaker McCarthy and I would designate senior members that we would negotiate to give our authority to make agreements and detail on what we wanted. So we narrowed the group. We narrowed the group to meet and hammer out our differences.
And we've done that. In fact, they've met last night, and they're going to be meeting again today. And I'll be in constant contact with my team while I'm at the G-7. And I'll be in close touch with Speaker McCarthy and other leaders as well.
Now, what I have done in anticipation that we won't get it all done until I get back is, I've cut my trip short in order to befor the final negotiations and sign the deal with the majority leader. I made it clear thatand I'll say it again: America is not a deadbeat nation. We pay our bills. The Nation has never defaulted on its debt, and it never will.
And we're going to continue these discussions with the congressional leaders in the coming days until we reach an agreement. And I'll have more to say about that on Sunday andwhen I'm going to have a press conference on this issue. As it stands now, the intention is to go to the G-7, be back here on Sunday, hold a press conference.
And in the meantime, I'm goingI've spoken to the Australian leader, Albanese, and I've spoken toI'm going to be seeing him at the G-7. He'll be there as well, along with the Indian Prime Minister and along with the Japanese as well. So the Quad members will be there. We'll get a chance to talk separately at the meeting, but it's unlikely I'm going to be going on to Australia.
So thank you very much.
Work Requirements for Federal Benefit Recipients 
Q. Mr. President, what about work requirements specifically are you still considering? It sounds like it's still on the table and you haven't ruled it out. Which would you be willing to accept?
The President. Well, I'm notthey'reI'm not going to accept any work requirements that's going to impact on medical health needs of people. I'm not going to accept any work requirements that go much beyond what is alreadywhat II voted years ago for the work requirements that exist. But it's possible there could be a few others, but not anything of any consequence.
Thank you.
Q. Mr. President

2023-05-17 00:00:00,Remarks on Presenting the Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor,"
Before I begin, let me say one thing I said to the families of the two deceased officers. All of you who have lost someone know that no matter how much you take pride in recognition of what they did when they were lost, it still brings back everything like it happened that moment. And I just say to the families, as I said to them personally at the time when I met them and now, it takes a lot of courage to do what you're doing. And thank you. Thank you, thank you.
Attorney General Garland, thank you for your leadership.
And today it's my honor to award nine brave Americans the Medal of Valor, the highest award this country can bestow on a public safety officer.
The award is given for actions above and beyond the call of duty and exhibiting exceptional courage, extraordinary decisiveness, presence of mind, and unusual swiftness in action, regardless of his or her personal safety, in an attempt to save or protect a human life.
To the honorees, I don't know all of you, but I do know you.
From small towns and big cities, you're cut from the same cloth. You run into danger when everybody else runs away from danger. You possess a selflessness that's literally impossible to explain. And your bravery is oneit inspires. It inspires people. It inspires the community.
Like Lieutenant Justin Hespeler. Served in the Marines and NYPD and, for the past 17 years, the Fire Department of New York. He heard me say before that there's an expression where I come from that, you know, God made man and then he made a few firefighters. [Laughter] You're all crazy, running into fire. [Laughter]
I was raised acrossI went to a little Catholic school in Claymont, Delaware, across from the fire station. Everyone I grew up, as the Secretary knows, was eitherbecame a firefighter or a cop or a priest. Here I am. [Laughter] Anywaybut all kidding aside, theone morning a few days before Thanksgiving, a house fire in Brooklyn. Heavy flames, thick smoke billowed from the windows.
Family members, including a 6-year-old boy, jumped from a two-story window, yelling, ""There's a baby up there."" Imagine the presence of mind of that young child. ""There's a baby up there."" Justin rushed into the fire, climbing a ladder to the second floor.
Searing heat and zero visibility forced him to the floor. The stairs collapsed. The hose burst, stopping fellow firefighters from being able to continue to put out the fire.
But the order came. ""Evac""
[At this point, the President coughed.]
Excuse me""evacuate immediately.""
Justin searched through the smoke as fast as he could, crawling through
[The President cleared his throat.]
Excuse mecrawling through the hall until he found a 5-week-old baby unconscious in his crib. Justin shielded the newborn with his body, crawled back through the smoke to the window and down to safety. New York's Bravest. New York's Bravest.
And then there's Lieutenant Jackson [Jason; White House correction] Hickey. Patrolling the waters in a fireboat onone September afternoon, and he got an urgent call that came into hison his boat. Someone was in the Harlem River being swept away by the current.
Lieutenant's boat sped to the spot beneath the Triborough Bridge. They saw a man fighting to keep his head above water as the river pulled him away, past jagged concrete toward the harbor.
In desperation, the man pulled himself into a storm tunnel built byinto the seawall. You know, spotting his only chance to save the man, Lieutenant Hickey dove indove into the water. He swam 25 feet, deep into the dark, black 4-by-4-foot tunnel where the young man was; found the man; dragged him back out into the river.
The man was, as you'd understand, panicked and struggling, and kept disappearing beneath the water. Again and again, Lieutenant Hickey went down after him, fighting the currents and incoming tide, and pulled the man to the boat, saving his life while risking his own. That's bravery.
Months earlier, 2 miles off Staten Island, FDNY firefighter Patrick Thornton heard a distress call: a motorist [motorboat; White House correction] was taking on water. Within minutes, Patrick and his fellow firefighters reached the 18-foot motorboat. A giant wave crashed down, sending the passenger overboard. And his fellow firefighters rescued one person as the motorboat began to sink.
But in a split second, the motorboat rolled over, trapping a second victim under the sinking boat. Without hesitation, Firefighter Thornton removed his safety equipment and dove in. Imagine diving under a sinking boat weighing literally a ton, limited visibility.
But somehow, Patrick grabbed and swam him out from underneath that sinking boat and then up to the surface where his fellow firefighters pulled them to safety.
That's true heroism. That's true heroism.
In Claremont County, Ohio, near Cincinnati, Sheriff's Deputy Bobby Pham. A 28-degree November day, a woman called in a crisisa crisis hotline she called to from her car, threatening suicide. And Deputy Pham arrived on the scene, spotted her driving her Buick down a boat ramp into the frigid lake.
The car started going under. As the current pulled it 50 feet from shore, he jumped in. He jumped into that water. A colleague threw him a rope that was too short. He told the woman to roll down the window and cling to the roof. Somehow Deputy Pham made it to the car and grabbed hold of the woman and managed to grasp the end of the rope so a colleague could pull them to shore. Relentless bravery. Relentless bravery.
Houston Police Sergeant Kendri SimpoKendrickexcuse meKendrick Simpoworking an extra job on Saturday morning as a security guard in a mall in Houston. A report came in that a man wearing a black leather mask with metal spikes on it, armed with an AR-15 with 120 rounds of ammo and a handgun 40 feet from where hundreds of children gathered for a dance competition.
Sergeant Simpo ran to the scene, but he didn't want to panic the children by drawing his weapon as he approached, so he kept it holstered. He rushed the gunman alone, tackling him to the ground and grabbed the AR-15 and used it to pin the suspect to the wall until help arrived.
When asked about his heroism, Sergeant Simpo said, ""I know what I signed up for."" ""I know what I signed up for."" A lot of people may know what they sign up for until it hits, man, and you don't really know what you signed up for. [Laughter]
You know, I think one of youryou knowyou signed up forI think it's one of the hardest jobs in America, what you signed up for. And it hits hardest when your ownwhen your own is in danger.
Littleton, Colorado, Police Officer Corporal Jeffrey Farmer and his partner, Officer David Snook, responded to a call of shots fired. In a dark parking lot, they approached the suspect's vehicle. One of the suspects took off running from the vehicle. The foot chase that followed, Corporal Farmer severely injured his knee. Officer Snook chased the suspect into the lobby of a apartment building, where the gunman shot him multiple times.
Corporal Farmer somehow made it to his injured partner, returning fire and dragging his partner out of the doorway amid the hail of bullets. Realizing that Officer Snook didn't have time to wait for an ambulance, Corporal Farmer pulled him into his patrol car and raced to the hospital. And just a few more minutes, Officer Snook would have died. Thanks to Corporal Farmer, he survived, and he canand he can be a dad to his three young boys, who I got to meet today.
On this day, remember allallall the families. You know, the English poet John Milton once wrote, ""They also serve who only stand and wait."" They also serve who only stand and wait. Each time your officer pins on their shield and walks out that door, there are spouses, children, parents who stand and wait and hope for their safe return. In some cases, dreaddepending what the call isdread that they'll get a call.
To all the family members here, especially those who have served in uniform: Thank you, thank you, thank you.
And finally, while acts of heroism mean lives saved, they can also mean lives lost. Today we posthumously honor two deceased NYPD detectives from the 32nd Precinct: Wilbert Mora and JacksonJason Rivera. And we honor Detective Sumit Sulan, who is also here today.
Here, one day in January, in Harlem, they responded to a 911 call from a distressed woman. Her grown-up son was threatening her and his brother. When they arrived at the apartment, Detective Mora and Rivera walked down the hallway in the back room to check on the man.
Detective Sulan, then still a rookie, was assigned to observe his more experienced colleagues, stayed back with the mom and the other son. Suddenly, the door flew open. The man started firing from the back room. He had a stolen Glock, illegally modified with a drum magazine capable of holding 40 rounds. Detective Rivera and Mora were hit.
Detective Rivera died a few hours later at age 22, one of the youngest officers ever killed on the line of duty. Detective Mora died 4 days later, just 27 years old. They are the ""who"" and the ""what"" law enforcement of this country should be.
You know, their families are here today, including Detective Mora's mom, sister, and Detective Mora's [Rivera's; White House correction] childhood sweetheart, married just months before he was killed. She's expecting their child any day now.
I told the story of Detective Mora and Rivera at a State of the Union last year. And I spoke with the families shortly after their funerals. I told them, and I meant it then and I mean it now, that our Nation is forever in debt for their loved ones and the sacrifice they made on behalf of their fellow citizens.
That terrible day, when the bullets started flying, Detective Sulan had only been thenwith the precinctthe 32nd Precinct for 2 months. Two months. But he jumped into action. He shielded the mother and brother from gunfire, then drew his weapon to fire twice, hitting the gunman and ending the incident.
A very dark day for the city of New York could have been moreeven more tragic, with a much higher body count, if it weren't for Detective Sulan.
Let meyou know, I met the detective shortly after that, and I knew his relatives were going to be around. And he relives that day often. Detective Mora and Rivera are never far from his mind. And the entire Nation is grateful for the quick thinking, swift action, and courage under fire that he demonstrated.
So let me close this. There's no greater responsibility of government than to ensure the safety of the American people and those who serve and protect us all. We're incredibly proud of all of you, and I mean that. Incredibly proud of all of you. And we're going to have your back as long as we need to, as long as you're engaged.
You know, in just the past 2 weeks, our Nation has observed a National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Weekend, National Police Weekend, National Peace Memorial Officers Day, and I've also hosted this event several times as President and Vice President, and cosponsored the bill that created the Medal of Freedom when I was a U.S. Senatorthe Medal of Valorwhen I was a U.S. Senator.
These are the samethese are some of the most meaningful things that I do as President, because knowing you, meeting your families, looking in your eyes, seeing your courage gives me so much hope for the country. You representand this is not hyperboleyou represent the very best of us. You represent the best of who we are as Americans.
And God bless you all, and May God protect public safety officers and their families.
It's now my honor to award these medals and ask my Military Aides to read the citations. Thank you.
[At this point, Lt. Col. Azizi V. Wesmiller, USA, Army Aide to the President, read the citations, and the President presented the medals and certificates, assisted by Lt. Cmdr. Adam M. Shields, USN, Navy Aide to the President.]
Well, let's give one last round ofbig round of applause to the recipients of the Medal of Valor.
Well, thank you all for your service and your sacrifice. And I mean this sincerely: May God bless you and your families.
WeAmerica owes you a debt of gratitude. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

Madam President, thanks for letting meletting me show up andlast minute here.
And, Whip Katherine Clark, thanks for letting me interrupt. You're doing a hell of a job, and you've been a great partnera great partnerhelping us get so much done in Congress.
And I want to wish happy birthday to my friend Mignon Moore. Mignon, are you here? Mignon, it's hell turning 30, but you'll get used to it. [Laughter]
And I heard my friend, Nancy Pelosi, is being honored, and I knew I had to be here.
I couldn't miss a chance to be with all of you either. I want to say thanks to EMILY's List for everything you're doing and letting me crashand allowing me to crash tonight's party. I'm not going to stay long, I promise.
I honestly believe thatNancy, I've been saying this for a long time, and I mean it from the bottom of my heart: Nancy Pelosi is going to go down in history as one of the most consequential Speakers in the history of the United States ever[applause]not merely because she's a woman; because she's so incredible. She's such a
Audience member. Woo!
The President. No, nowith Nancy leading the way, you never had to worry about whether the bill would pass. If she said she had the votes, she had the votes every time.
And she had to vote so many lifechanging pieces of legislation. She helped rescue the economy in the great depression; pass the Affordable Care Act; ended ""don't ask, don't tell."" Just since I took office, she led the fight to help us pass the American Rescue Plan, the bipartisan infrastructure law, CHIPS and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction Act. She defended democracy[applause]and she defended democracy in the wake of January the 6th.
Look, she's been a steadfast defender of women's rights. I need not even mention thatthe right to choose. But I want to thank every single person in this room for leading the way in that fight. It's a critical fight. It's about democracy. It's about freedom. And I also want to thank my buddy, Kamala, who I work for in[laughter]up in the White House, for leading on this issue.
Look, I don't have to tell you how much is at stake. That's why your work is so important. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
And with that, I want to say just one more thing. You know, there is athere's a famous quote that is one that says: ""What we've done for ourselves"" died with""dies with us. What we've done for others and the world remains immortal.""
One of the reasons why Nancy is going to be so, so well thought of in history as well is what she's done for everyone. I mean it. She's a gamechanger. And with that, it's my honor to introducebring to the floor my good friend, Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
Representative Nancy Pelosi. Now, let's say together, ""We are EMILY."" We are EMILY!

2023-06-19 00:00:00,"Remarks on Efforts To Combat Climate Change in Palo Alto, California","
Well, thank you, Chiena, for that introduction.
Governor Newsom, I tell you what, it's nice to be here, as you said, working on something that's a positive thing going forward and not fixing something that happened veryvery badly. We've spent a lot of time in helicopters flying over areas that needed helped.
Folks, I want to thankAnna, thank you, kid. [Laughter] You've been incredible. You've been a friend for a long, long time in the Congress, when I was in the Senate. And you've done remarkable work. You've partnered on everything from protecting the environment to providingimproving the lives of the people in this district.
And thanks to all the climate leaders that are here today.
You know, we just visited the salt marsh, as you saw. We walked down to the end of the Safety Bay ProjectSafer Bay Project, anda public-private partnership that's harnessing the nature of our ability to do what this young woman, Chiena, did.
You know, one of theI always sayI neverand I mean it sincerely: I've been around a long time in public life. I got elected when I was about your age, when I was 28 years old. And you know what? I've never been more optimistic. I'veyou and I were talking about the privately. I swear to God, I've never been more optimistic in my life.
And the reason I'm optimistic is because of this generation. It's the best educated, the most engaged, the most involved, and the most consequential. They're inthey're in. The Governor was telling me about when they announced the program, there was 3,000 slots, and about 10,000 people immediately signed on or tried to sign on.
Well, look, these wetlands act as a critical buffer between the rising tides and the communities at risk, protecting homes, property, and infrastructure against flooding. They also absorb carbon dioxide from the air. And we're right next to Route 101, andwhere cars and trucks emit a lot of carbon pollution.
What we're seeing here is an amazing success story of how you can work together to make our communities more climate-resilient. It matters. It matters. Resiliency matters.
You know, I've toured many sites across the country that clearly show climate change is a genuineis the existential threat to humanity. The existential threat to humanity.
Here in California, the Governoryou and I stood together with first responders near Monterey Bay after touring the damage that was done. The devastating storms caused historic flooding that killed 21 people. That comes on the heels of the worst droughts in California in more than a millennia and the highest sea-level rise in more than a century.
I've seen wildfire devastation across the West, burning more acres to the ground than there are square miles in the State of Maryland. That's how much got burned to the ground and all thejust flying over, just devastating.
There's been historic tornadoes and flooding in the Midwest and the Southeast.
And just last week, across the East Coast and Midwest, we saw what you've already seen here in California: millions of Americans sheltering indoors, the air not safe to breathe, orange haze covering the sky. It's incredible.
By the way, to address those wildfire smoke that's coming from Canada, we're sharing cutting-edge technology that's already used here in California to help detect early fires and help them in sending, in addition to that, firefighters and tankers as well.
Folks, the impacts we're seeing in climate change are only going to get more frequent and more ferocious and more costly. Last year alonelast year alone, natural disasters in America caused $165 billion in damage, just last year alone$165 billion in damage. But the worsening impacts are not inevitable.
Building on our incredible effort locally, my administration is doing all we can to help recover and build so we can be prepared toand adapt. You know, it's all part of my ""Invest in America"" agenda the Governor was referencing. It starts with the most significant climate investment law ever anywhere in the history of the world. Over billions and billions$368 billion369, to be precisein clean energy development, environmental justice, conservation, and so much more.
We will cut 1 billion tons of carbon emission a year, create millions of good-paying jobs. And it's already attracting billions of dollars in the private sector, because businesses are realizing it's overwhelmingly in their interest. As a matter of fact, a couple of businesses are suing banks because they want to consider whether or not they're environmentallyanyway. I won't get into all that. I'll get[laughter].
But I want to emphasize again: We're taking the most aggressive climate action ever. It's focused on mitigationwhich means historic investments in developing clean energy by reducing dependence on fossil fueland resilience, which means communitiescommunitiescan better withstand the impacts of climate change and extreme weather.
With a combination of the bipartisan infrastructure law and the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS and Science Act, we've invested more than $50 billion so far in climate resilience; nearly $9 billion to make transportation infrastructure more resilient by elevating roads and bridges above projected flood zones; $13 billion to decrease the wildfire risk and improve forest health and paying for firefighters who risk their lives every day.
Drought mitigation: $15.4 billion to bolster the West's resilience to drought. These investments are being made in the context of a megadrought affecting the Colorado River Basin.
Forty million40 millionAmericans already drinking water that thousands of farmers rely on forfor integration [irrigation; White House correction]. And 40 million count on that river, and so do the farmers.
Six-point-six billion dollars in coastal resilience restoration of reefs and construction of other infrastructure to mitigate storm damage, plus more than $17 billion from the bipartisan infrastructure law to bolster resilience for coastal water and waterways infrastructure, including funding to address food, floods, storms, hurricane risks, and restore coastal ecosystems.
Climate-smart agriculture: nearly $20 billion in funding for precisionirrigation and planting cover crops, plus a $1 billion America the Beautiful Challenge to accelerate locally led conservation efforts.
Folks, flood mitigation: $3.5 million [billion; White House correction] to reduce or eliminate the risk of repetitive flood damage to buildings, plus $1 billion in funding mitigation measures to increase community resilience, like supporting adaptations of hazard-resistant building codes.
And maybe most important, I've committed that by 2020 [2030; White House correction], we will have conserved 30 percent of all the lands and waters the United States has jurisdiction over and simultaneously reduce emissions to blunt climate impacts.
And we're on our way. Conservation of land and waterwe put more in conservation of land and water than any President in the history of the United States sincebut John Kennedy.
And we're leading the way in Palo Alto and East Palo Alto and to Belle Haven. For instance, a local nonprofit called Climate Resilient Communities gives communities[applause]. Thank you. Are you all part of that? Thank you. It gives members a voice in planning and adaptation.
I'm here today to announce that we're putting our critical climate investment to work.
Folks, first, starting tomorrow, the Department of Commerce will launch the first and largest competitive Climate Resilience Regional Challenge to provide $600 million to coastal and Great Lake communities that are building projects to protect against the impacts of climate change from sea-level rise, flooding, and storm surge.
We're investing in the people and places that have been hit the hardest, but who are also on the frontlines of leading us forward.
Folks, the second thing we're doing: The Department of Energy is going to announce that it's investing more than $2 billion to modernize our electric grid to be more climate resilient, including more than $67 million starting off in California.
That funding can help ensure our electric grid is stronger, that the lights and air conditioning and internet stay on during heat waves and storms and other climate events, so the lights can stay on in hospital operating rooms, nursing homes, and so many other critical care facilities.
And third, later this year, we're hosting the first-ever White House summit that convenes local, State, Tribal, and Territorial leaders focused on climate resilience.
It's going to include a roadmap for how these historic climate actions are going to build more climate-resilient communities all across America, saving lives and homes and providing peace of mind.
This is how we're going to meet the moment. This is how we're going tounfortunately, some of our MAGA Republican friends in Congress are continuing to try to undo all the progress we've already made in the first 2 years.
They were holding the country hostage over the debt limit unless I would gut the climate provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act. I was determined not to let that happen. With your significant helpand I mean that sincerelyall of you here, particularly Anna in the House and the Congress, we didn't let it happen.
And in the end, we didn't just protect some of the climate money and clean energy provisions. We protected every single, solitary one.
But this ain't your father's Republican Party. [Laughter] They're back at it again with another bill to repeal the same provisions. But with your help, we're going to stop them again.
Let me close with this. Throughout our history, we're the only nation in the world that has come out of every crisis we've entered stronger than we went into it.
We're doing it again here on the climate crisis.
When I think of climate, I think of jobs. When I think of climate, I think of innovation. When I think of jobsclimate, I think of turning peril into progress.
That's why I'm so optimistic about the future. I really am.
We just have to remember who in hell we are. We're the United States of America, for God's sake. There is nothingnothing, nothingbeyond our capacity if we work together.
And that's what all of you are doing herehave been doing and we're going to continue to do. And God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.
Let's go get 'em. Let's get this done.

2023-06-19 00:00:00,"Remarks at a Campaign Reception in Los Gatos, California","
Well, Shannon and Kev, thank you very, very much. And I want to thank your family for all you've been willing to do and standing up and speaking out.
You know, it is true thatI remember when I ran the first time, I made a speech at Independence Hall withone night, with a wholeI don't know how many peoplefive, six, seven hundred people. And I talked about that I thought democracy was at risk, and I defined what I thought democracy was.
And the press, understandably, was somewhat skeptical why the heck I was talking about democracy the way I did. It turns out, after that speech was over, for the next couple of weeks, it turned out, there were over 65 percent of the American people registered, saying that they were concerned as well.
You know, we're the most unique nation in the history of the world. We're uniquely a product of our political institutions, unlike any other nation. I mean, not that we're better or worse, just unique. We're in a situation where the vast majority of countries are formed based on ethnicity, on religion, on all things that don't relate to anything other than an idea.
We're based on an idea that we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men and women are created equal, et cetera. And we've never fully lived up to it, but we've never in the pastsince, I guess, way back in the Civil Warwalked away from it. We've never walked away from it.
And so I'll tell you a quick story. When Iwhen you got me elected, and you didwhen you got me elected, I walked inI didn't realize, even though I'd been in the Oval Office every day for 8 years in a row, 9 o'clock in the morning with BarackI didn't realize there was a requirement that the outgoing President be out of the office by 10 o'clock on the 20th and the incoming President could come inI think it was at 3 or 4 o'clock.
And so I asked my brother Jim, who has better taste than I do, to set up the office for me, from everything from picking the rug, to the desk, and that kind of thing. For real. And he brought along with him a Presidential historian named Jon Meacham. And Jon Meacham was helping out, and I was unaware of that at the time.
And so when I came in that day, the other guy didn't have to worry; he never showed up at all. But[laughter].
But at any rate, what happened was that I looked over at the mantelpiece. And a couple of you have been to the Oval since then; you're all welcome, by the way. I mean that sincerely.
Thethere's a picturea big portrait ofpaintinga big oneof Roosevelt. Well, I'm proud Roosevelt was a Democratic President, but I wondered why. And then there were four portraits that are much smaller: one, George Washington, which had always been over the mantel; and then one of Abraham Lincoln; and then oneand thenanyway, without going into all the detail, the bottom line was, I said, ""Why?""
And Meacham spoke up and he said: ""Well, not since Dwight""not sinceexcuse me, not since Roosevelt has any President inheritedsuch a circumstance internationally, where there was so much at stake, in terms of the world economy as well.
And then I said, ""Why Lincoln?"" He said, ""Well, the country has never been as divided since then."" And I started thinking about it.
But I announced when I ran, the first timeI said I was running for three reasons, and I meant it: One was to restore the soul of the Nation. By that, I meant restore the sense of dignity and honor, be that we would once again be looked at as a nation that was one that led by example a little bit. Secondly was to rebuild the middle class, which had taken a real hit the previous number of years. And the third reason was to unite the country again.
And the press, understandably, wasand a lot of people who were supporting me thought: ""Well, I'm not sure that makes any sense, especially the uniting part. No one can unite the country."" But I'm convinced that the vast majority of the American people still understand who we are and what we're about.
And so what we did was, when we, in fact, put together this program, the initiatives we had, was I said that we were going to move in a bipartisan way.
Well, guess what? We inherited a circumstance where we hadthe economy was in disarray; we werewe had an ""American first"" policy that was not doing very well around the world from our allies, fromanyway, not doing very well.
And in addition to that, we found ourselves in a circumstance where it was very difficult to convince the American people that we could get things done.
And so we worked very hard. And we ended up in the first almost, I guess, 20 months22 months initiallynow it's longercreating more jobs than any President has in 4 years: over 13 million 500 thousand jobs.
We also put ourselves in the position where we found ourselves inhaving toa circumstance where we were once again beginning to be respected by the rest of the world.
I've spent, I figureI think theymy staff figured it out: With other NATO and European and Far East leaders, but particularly heads of state in thein Europe, I've spent over 180 hours with them, either together in a group, individually, or on Zoom. Because they really are looking to what we think is important, what we thinkwhat we're willing to do.
When I first got to the first G-7 meetingthat's the seven largest economiesin London, in February, after I was elected, I sat down at a roundliterally, a round table. It was a beautiful area we were sitting in, outside andin southwest LondonI mean, southwest England.
And I said, ""Well, America is back."" And Macron looked at me, and he said, ""For how long?"" [Laughter] For how long? He wasn't being a wise guy; he wasit was genuine questions.
And then I got a comment from a guy I'd become friends with, Scholz of Germany, the Chancellor. He said: ""Mr. President, what would you think if tomorrow morning you picked up the paper here in the England, and the London Times had said, 'A thousand people broke down the doors of Parliament; killed several bobbies in order to overthrow the election'""? And I hadn't thought of it that way before.
But think how the rest of the world looked at what happened here, without makingblaming anybody, just what happened. What happened.
And so what we didwe worked very hard to try to bring our allies back together, which I think we have; unite the world. We have the idea of when I was toldand I was told, folks, I was going to try to get Japan engaged and change their attitude and budgetattitude toward Korea, their budget, in terms of their military budget and their engagement in Europe.
It's never happened before. Well, it's happened. They're engaged in a big way. In a big way. They've actually made an rapprochement with Chinawith thewithexcuse me, with South Korea after all these years since World War II. Things are moving.
Things are moving in terms of what's happening as well in Europe, in terms of the NATO cohesion, et cetera. We've got the Quad going.
My generic point isI guess the reason why I'm so optimistic is, the rest of the world is like everybody else: They want to get something done. They want to get back to some sense of normality. And, for example, the idea that there is this cohesion in Europe stilland remember, everyone assumed, and it was not an irrational assumption, that Putin was convinced that he could wait and just see NATO break up over the issue of Ukraine.
Soand then, at home, similar things happened. The idea that in a 1-week span every major environmental group would endorse me, and then the verythe following week, I'd be endorsed by a group of people whowhere you think would behave trouble with environmental groupsthe major labor unions, every major labor union in America for the first time this early. And thiscoherently supported a candidate.
And then wethe same thing acrossI guess what I'm trying to say is, I think there's a hunger for a unity based on rationality, not based on just unity for unity's sake, because people know that we've lost something when we lost that sort of centerhow can I say it?that glue that kind of held democracyrock bottom, as to who we were.
And so I'm confident about this election because of the people I'm standing before. But I don't mean I'm that kind of confident. But I'm confident because I think that there is a sense of wanting to finish the job.
We've created, as I said, 1-pointexcuse me, 13.4 million jobs, 800,000 manufacturing jobs. Inflationunemployment is down to near historic low, at 3.7 percent. Black unemployment low, Hispanic unemployment is extremely low, relative to where we are. Inflation is down 11 months in a row. You are a lot of veryyou're all very successful business women and men. You understand that everything is fragile.
But I think if we keep moving, we can get things done. And let me end by saying the things I want to get done.
I think it's critically important that we lock down thehow can I say it?the sensethe idea that there are more children being killed in America by gunshots than by any other[inaudible]it just makes no sense. I own two shotguns. I'm not a big hunter, but I used to target shoot.
But the point I'm making is that the idea that you could drive your car up here, park your car, and if some 14-year-old kidif you left the key in, it took the car and ran it off the road here and hurt somebody, you'reyou're civilly liable.
Well, you should have to lock up your guns. What's the big damn deal about that? Look at all theseall theseall these kids who have blown people away, large numbers.
You know, we should be in a position where we have universal background checks. We should be in a position where the idealook, AR-15s are weapons of war. And I think the reason whyand I think it's going to become clear pretty soonthe reason why: The only industry in America you can't sue is the gun manufacturers. Imagine if that were the law with regard towith regard to tobacco. How many people would be dead today, thatare alive because we've been able to take on tobacco?
And so there are so many things we can do in that area.
We can alsoit's about time that the ultimatefreedomthe right to choose should be a right left between a woman and her doctor. And so the idea is that now we're in a position where it's been ruled that it's not a constitutional guarantee, not guaranteed by theno place in the Constitution that guarantees it for the first time in 50-some years. It's pulled away.
So there's nothing that you're going towe're not going to be able to pass a constitutional amendment, but I'll tell you what we can do: We can pass a national law taking Roe v. Wade and codifying it in every State and making sure, if you have a majority of the Statesand we're going to be in a position where that becomes the law of the land.
But my point is thatthink of all theall the horror stories you've heard, not just the normal ones, but you know, a young womanpeople moving from one State to another.
You have a guy froma former football coach from Alabama is holding upI think it'sI'll ask my sonI think it's 57 flag appointmentsmilitary appointments for the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on down the line. Because the military said if you are in the military, you're having a troubled pregnancy, and you're in a State where you're not allowed to see the doctor perform anyany remedial operation on you, then you can get paidyou can have leave to go to where you can do that.
Well, he said, unless that's changed, he's holding up all theall thesewe're in awe're in aI mean, it'sit's just bizarre. I don't remember it happening before. And I've been around. I know I don't look like I've been around[laughter]but I've been around. I've been around a long time.
But the point I'm making is, there are so many things that are of consequence that we can solve. And the vast majority of people, all the data shows, support the positions we're generically taking. It's not like these are wacko ideas that we've come up with.
And so I think it's really important we sort of reinstill a sense of, I don't knowa sense of confidence in the Constitution, even though people don't think of it in exactly those terms.
But I'm basicallynow I'm talking too much. And the view is incredible. [Laughter] My view isI see you and theand the environmentyou have a bad view. You only see me. [Laughter]
But all kidding aside, whywhat am I supposed toam I going to takeBoss, come on up here, man.

The President. Steve, thank you. I used to dream of being charismatic. [Laughter] Anyway. All kiddingthank you. Thank you, thank you.
By the way, there's the real reason we're gathered here: We have two recent college graduates in the front row here. Stand up, guys. No, you got to stand up. I'm going to embarrass you. Stanford and Cal. That's the only reason I came out. I want to get to know who's going to be running the country later.
So Ilook, I want to thank Anna for allowing me toa passport into the district. Thank you, Anna. We've been working together a long, long time.
And the fact of the matter is that, you know, Anita is here somewhere. I don't know where there you are, Anita. Well, I tell you what: You're the only reason I came out. [Laughter] Thank you. Nono, you've beenyou've been wonderful.
And I want to thank everyone here because, quite frankly, I wouldn't be standing here talking to you were it not for most of the people in this room. A lot of you have been helping me for a long, long time. I go back 217 years, to Joe Cotchett. [Laughter] JoeJoe and I go back a long way. But I'm seriouslooking around the room, some of you've been with me a long time, and I truly appreciate it.
You knowyou know, a lot of world leaders I'vethe only thing that comes with serving a long time in office is you get to know a lot of people. And I've had an opportunity to meet virtually every world leader in the past 35 years or more. And one of the things that I get askedwell, let me put it this way: I waswhen Barack was President and I was Vice President, it was clear that President Huand that was his name at the time, the President of Chinaand his Vice President, Xiwhere Xi was going to be the successor, Vice President to become President in the near term.
And it wasn't appropriate for Barack to be able to spend a lot of time getting to know him, so it was an assignment I was given. And I traveled 17,000 miles with him, usually one on one. IweI'd have a simultaneous interpreter, and he had one too. And we got to know each other fairly well.
And one of the thingswe were in the Tibetan Plateau, and he asked me one day, and he saidone of our meetingshe said, ""Can you define America for me?"" And this is the God's truth. I said, ""Yes, in one word."" He said, ""What's that?"" I said, ""Possibilities.""
In America, we are the ""ugly Americans"" because we believe anything is possible when we work together. I'm being deadly earnest now. Think about it. When has there ever been a problem that we've decided to take on we thought we couldn't solve? As hard as it would be, whenwhen did that ever happen? And it hadn't happened.
There's never been a time when we haduntilof late, until the last time around, when we decided we're going to go it alone, ""America first."" We found ourselves in the position where there wasn't much coordination, and we stopped talking to one another.
You know, I told this story before: WhenI learned early on thatafter 8 years of sitting in the Oval Office every single morning at 9 o'clock with Barack, there were two questions he'd ask. We'd start off with kidding each other. He said, ""What do you think the temperature is in Hawaii?"" And I said, ""78."" [Laughter] That was ayou think I'm kidding. I'm not.
And then I'd say to himand I'd say, ""Remember, Barack,""I just called him Mr. President. ""Remember, Mr. President, all politics is personal,"" both international and national. You get togot to know the other team. You've got to know the other person, what's motivating that person and what's not motivating that person.
And so we spent a lot of time trying to figure out where this relationship was going to go, not only with China, but with Russia. You may remember, when I became President, I checked with the intelligence community to see if I couldwithout anyhurting any one individual, to letthe world know that for the first time since World War II, 135,000 people were going to invade another country.
And I said and I predictedand I toldat the time, it was cleared. And I told the Ukrainians that they were going to be invaded. They didn't believe it either. But for the first time, we hadeverno one contemplated the notion that there would be a Russian army that would invade another country with a hundredit ended up being 185,000 people.
The point I'm trying to make is this: You know, there's amy colleagues in the Senate used to always kid me because I was always quoting Irish poets. They thought I quoted Irish poets because I'm Irish. That's not the reason; they just happen to be the best poets in the world. [Laughter]
But Seamus Heaney, a poetand his wife I got to know very well after he passed awayhe wrote a poem called ""The Cure at Troy,"" and he said: ""All's changed, changed utterly. A terrible beauty has been born.""
All has changed, has changed utterly, both good and bad. It's a different world.
When I was deciding whether or not to run in nineteenturned arounddecided to run in 2020, I wasn't sure what to do, whether I was going to run or not. Because then I wasI started to write a book on whatAmerican inflection points, the things thatthose are things that occur within a relatively short span of time, less than a decade, that change the world for the next three, four, or five decades. It's happened about eight times in modern history. And we're at one of those junctures, in my view.
And then what happened was, along came what happened in Charlottesville. And that young woman that I metthe mom of the young woman who was killed. And the President was askedand those folksremember, they came walking out of theout of the woods, the fields, carrying torches, singing the same anti-Semitic bile that was sung inin Germany in the thirties and accompanied by White supremacists in the Ku Klux Klan. And my predecessor was asked, ""Well, whatwhat do you think?"" He said there were very good people on both sides.
That's when I knew things hadhad begun to change in a way that wasif we didn't move, it would be irreversible over a period of time.
And the reason I bother to say those things to you is, I think there's enormous prospects that we have as a consequence of the changes that you helped allow us to begin. Begin, not end. Begin. And many of those changes relate tothink about it: You know, we're toldI said I was running for three reasons, and a lot of you helped me last run.
I said I was running for three reasons. One, to restore the soul of this country. And that was to restore a sense of decency and honor and be able to talk with one another, be able to communicate back and forth with one another. The second reason was toto build the economy from the middle out and the bottom up, because when that happens, you all do very well, the wealthy do very well, and the middle class has a shot. And the disaffection of the middle class was growing, growing deeply. The percentage of the working class, high-school-educated population that voted Democrat was overwhelming. But they began to be left behind, not intentionally but it was the effectthat was a fact.
And think what we inherited when we came to office: an economy in disarray, a circumstance where we were the ""America first"" crowd. We weren'twe were justwe were disregarded, quite frankly, by the vast majority of our allies around the world.
And if you think I'm exaggerating, I'm not. The first meeting I attended as a U.S.as the United States President was in England, in the southeast of Francesoutheast of England, for the G-7 meeting, all thethe seven largest economies. And I sat down. We were seven of us at a round table. And I sat down, and I said, ""America is back."" And the French President looked at me and he said: ""For how long? For how long?""
And then the Chancellor of Germany looked at menew to the job himselflooked at me, and he saidhe said: ""What would you think, Mr. President, if tomorrow you woke up and in the London Times the headline was, 'A thousand people broke into the Parliament, broke down the doors of the House of Commons, two bobbies were killed, and in the process, they tried to stop the transfer of power'? What would you think?""
And I hadn't thought of it that way before, and I don't know that any of you have. Imagine the impact it's had on the rest of the world. The United States, all of a sudden, January 6I'm not trying to make a legal case, I'm just talking about the course of history. Imagineimagine how we'd feel if that was the case.
And so I had two jobs you elected me to do. First was to reestablish American leadership in the world, not so we could beat our chestsbecause if we don't do it, no one gets it done. No one has the influence, the power, the consequence, or the history to get it done. Nobody. It doesn't mean we're better than anybody else. It meansbut we are more unique than anybodythan another country.
You know, there's aevery other country in the world is based on theirtheir country, as a consequence of ethnicity, religion, geographyor something other thanother than geography. And we're the only country in the world that we're united based on an idea. That's whatand that's not hyperbole, that's a fact. Think about it. The only country organized based on an idea: that we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men and women are created equal, endowed by their Creator with certain rights, et cetera, et cetera.
We've never lived up to it, but we never walked away from it completely. And we've been thewe've been the linchpin that most democracies around the world look to to keep things moving. Madeleine Albright was right when she said we're the essential nation.
And so the point I'm trying to make here is that we had an obligation to try to reunite the world. I have spent, because of your helpI haven't been ableI've spent over now, they tell me, about 180 hours with European heads of state and allies, including the Japanese as well, who have come alongcome along a big way. And in terms of pulling these countries together.
If you notice, Putin was certain when hevirtually certain when he invaded that he was going to split NATO, that NATO would never stay together. NATO is more united than it's ever been in an entire history of NATO, because we've worked together. And it's critically important, and that was the job that I had.
I'm going to say something outrageous. I think I know as much about American foreign policy as anybody living, including Dr. Kissinger. That's what I've done my whole lifefor the last 270 years. [Laughter]
But the second pointthe second thing was, we had to figure out how to unite the country. And the press, understandablyit's not aI'm not criticizing the press when I say thisthe press sort of made light of my saying we've got to unite America. How can a democracy function without thewithout the consent of the Government, without cooperation? How does that work? I don't know any place that ever worked.
And so we spent a lot of time working on that. And when I said, Joe, that we're going to have bipartisanship, people looked at me like I was crazy. Because remember, they said: ""Well, Biden was a real bipartisan leader when he was a Senator. And he was known for being able to[inaudible]. But this is different."" Well, guess what? We came up with a trillion-200-billion-dollar bipartisan infrastructure bill. It's going to change[applause].
How in God's namehow in God's namecan we lead the world when we rank numberI think it's 16 in quality of infrastructure? How does that happen? It doesn't happen.
And we used to invest a significant amount of ourout of our entire GBTGDP, we invested on average 2 percent of our GDP on research and development. I'm in the middle of Silicon Valley; you guys have forgotten more about this than most people around the world know. No, I'm not beingI'm not being solicitous. I'm being deadly earnest.
But we stopped doing it; 0.7 percent was the max we, in fact, invested in research and development in America. The United States of America. So that's why I came up with this legislation relating to how we're going to deal with the whole notion of dealing with investments.
And, for example, when we did thewhen I put together a legislationor proposed the legislation relating to dealing with computer chips, sources ofyou know, we talked aboutyou all understood, but a vast majority of people in America don't understand what talking about source of product is. And we never talked about source before.
But, all of a sudden, we found ourselvesand we invented the computer chip. We used to have25 years ago, we produced 40 percent of the chips, which are needed for virtually everything now, as youI need not tell any of you. Well, guess what? We were down to 10 percent. How can thathow could that have happened?
So we changed the law. We invested significant amounts of money. We attracted $450 billionbillion dollars in private sector investment in that. $450 billion.
We're in a situation now where we have awe have overall thelook, $300 billion just for building fabs, justbuilding chip factories now.
You know, there's a situation[applause]but the reason why I thought that was so important, beyond America's place in the world, was, you know, we kept losing those blue-collar workers.
You know, my dad used to say: ""Joey a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay. We're going to make it.'""
We'll, they're stripped of their dignity. We started to decide to go where the labor was cheapest. We'd export jobs and import product. Well, there's a little law that existed since 1935. It says, ""Buy America."" Any moneyany amount of money that Congress gives me, I can insist that it be purchased 100-percent American manufacturer. And consistent with the WTO. I can insistbut no one was willing to do it.
Well, guess what? You better be buying American and hiring Americans. And if you don't have the capacity, we make exceptions. We make exceptions.
But, folks, the point is thatguess what?it's created thousands and thousands and thousands of jobs.
And, for example, the fab that Intel is building outside of Columbus, Ohio, that fab is employing 12,000 people: 5,000 people working in the fab when it's constructed and 7,000 people building it. Well, the 7,000 people are getting paid prevailing wage. And guess what? The 3,000the 5,000 people that are going to work, they're going to have an average salary of an excess of $120,000 a year. And you don't need a college degree.
All of a sudden, we're paying attention to blue-collar workers again. We're building the country from the middle out and the bottom up. And the wealthy are still doing very, very well.
We also did the same thing with regard towe used toyou know, the VA can negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies. Pharmaceutical companies aren't bad guys, just so they charge Americans more than anybody else. Not a joke.
The most significant medicine you needprescription you need, you can go to Toronto, Canada; Paris, France; Madrid, Spain, and buy it cheaper from the same exact manufacturer as you buy it here.
So we said, because they can negotiate drug prices for veterans, we should be able to drug negotiate drug prices for thefor Medicare. And guess what? It had the added advantage of reducing the debt by $168 billion, just as it relates to one thing: insulin.
But here's my point: My point is, we did thiswe created 13 million-plus jobs in the first 2 years, more than any President ever has in 4 yearsin 4 years. We're now in a situation wherewe're in a situation where we're able to do things that we couldn't do before.
And allthis entire period, all this spendingthe ""big-spending Biden""guess what? We reduced the debt by $1.7 trillion at the same time because of the ingenuity of the people in this room.
You know what I said when I was talking about that Intel project? Sis it SM? Whatwhatwhat's the outfit in South Korea?
Audience member. SMC.
The President. SMC. I met with the CEO of SMC in South Korea. And I said, ""Why are you making this investment?""
And they're investing a significant amount of money$100 million they committedin the ""field of dreams,"" I call it, that thousand acres just offjust west ofof Columbus, Ohio.
And I saidyou know, I asked him, ""Why are you doing it?"" And he said: ""Because it's the safest investment we can make anywhere in the world, in the United States. And secondly, you have the best, finest workers.""
Well, a lot of you probably are wondering why I'm so prounion. I'm pro- 
Audience member. Woo-hoo!
The President. I'mwell, I'm prounion for a simple reason: what people underestimateand I thinkI've watchedI've met with the Business Roundtable. I've met withand II asked them at the meeting we had with about 40 members of the Business RoundtableI said, ""You guys are wondering why I'm prounion."" I said: ""Let me ask you a question. When I was Vice President, I visitI met with 352 of you out of the Fortune 500. And I asked you one thing: 'What do you need most?'""
You know what they said: an educated workforce. But you don't educate your workforce anymore. You don't invest the money in educating your workforce.
I come from the State of DuPont: Delaware. When I got elected 200 years ago, DelawareDuPont was the eighth largest corporation in America. Every new enterprise they engaged in, they spent the money educating their own folks. Now the public gets to do it.
So why do you oppose my effort to invest more in education? And guess what? We've got support now, investing in education.
My generic point is the same. There's so much we can do. And we can do it without hurting anyone, just growing the economy.
And look, one of the things that happenedand I'll stop with thisone of the things that happened when thelet me back up so I say it this way. How many of you are not from this area?
[At this point, a phone rang.]
[Laughter] He's calling again, isn't he? He keeps calling me. I don't know why. [Laughter]
No, all kidding aside. How many you are not from Silicon Valley? And how many are you from smaller Midwestern towns or near? You know what happens when the factory closes. The soul of the community is lost. Not a joke. It's not only the loss of the jobs. It's the loss of their sense of self-worththeir sense of self-worth.
And so, one of the things we're doing now is we'reall these offices are investing throughout the Midwest, throughout the Southin the South.
Matter of fact, I'm going to show up for a major initiative and investment that's taking place in North Georgia, in the home of Marjorie Taylor Greene. [Laughter] It's a multibillion-dollarit's a multi-multimillion-dollar project. Okay? But I'm going to be there with a spade to turn the dirt, because I saidand I mean itI represent all Americans, whether they're Democrats or Republicans or whoever they are.
Because, look, we've got to unite the country. We've got to let people know what we're doing.
And soany rate, there are a number of thingsand oneone last thing I want to talk a little bit about, and then I'll hush up, because I was told that I'm not going to get to get questions from y'all.
A couple things. The environment: The existential threat to the United States and to humanity, not a joke, is environmentclimate change, if we do nothing about it.
You know, it used to be a whole hell of a lot of people who thought that climate change was not an issue. Well, I have now flown over more burned-down forest in helicoptersa lot with your Governor, I might addas a consequence of what's happened inbecause of climate change than you can imagine. As much territory, since I've come into office, has burned to the ground that makes up the entire geography of the State of Maryland. That's how much has burned to the ground in the United States.
When I was out here about 3 years ago saying I worried about the Colorado River drying up, everybody looked at me like I was crazy. They looked at me like when I said I worried about Putin using tactical nuclear weapons.
It's real. But it's all doable. We canwe can do it. We can deal with it. We can make it happen. And we can create millions of good-paying jobs.
And what we can do when we do thisand, by the way, thatwe're in a situation where, in terms of thedealing with the environment, there is a broad political coalition that's beginning to form. The idea that I was able to, for example, get endorsements by every single major environmental group and, at the same time, every major union in America. I mean, seriously, if I had said that to you 2 years ago, what are the prospects of that?
But guess what? Everybody is kind of figuring it out. And by the way, the reason I push unions so much is they're not a bunch of thugs that are portrayed by many people. What they are isthey're blue-collar workers who have to go back to college, in effect, for 3 to 5 years in an apprenticeship, getting paid less in order to get the license to be able to be an electrician, get the license to be able to bego down the list.
Anyway, I made a commitment. I made a commitment that my term as President of the United States, I was going to make sure that 30 percent of all of our lands and all of our waters under American jurisdiction would be conserved by the year 2030.
And we're on target to get it done. For example, in Cape HaleCamp Hale in Colorado, 500excuse me50,000 acres. Boundary Waters in Minnesota, 225,000 acres. Spirit Mountain in Nevada, 5,000500,000 acres. The Castner Range in Texas, over 608600excuse me6,600 acres. Alaska, 25,000 acres I put in conservation: the Tongass Forest, Bristol Bay, the AtlanticArctic Ocean, and North Slope.
In addition to that, there are multiple, multiple miles around Hawaii that are off limits now to moving in terms of anything other than conservation. And so
And, by the way, we're going to reduce emissions by 2030 in the world byof the United States by 50 to 52 percent.
We put so much money into the power grid. How many of your fires out here have been because of those high-tension wires that have come down as a consequence of storms, tornadoes, et cetera?
The end result is the power gridwe're now gettingand your power companies and others around the worldaround the country decided they're going to put it underground. It's five to six times more expensive, but, with our help, we're going to be able to get it done. It's going to save millions of acres of land.
We're in a situation where we also haveI was able to get, on the South Lawnand this is not me just reminding people, but reminding what they really were about. I got everybody lasta year ago last summer on the South Lawn, all the auto companies in Detroit. And they agreed.
Mary Robinson [Barra; White House correction], the Chairman of the Board of General Motors, was saying that she was suing the State of California because you had a higher standardemission standard than they did. And she said no State could have a standard lower than that of the United States Government.
Well, guess what? I got a phone call after that meeting with her and all these folks on the South Lawn, saying she dropped her suit and she committed to go all electric by 2035. Know what that means?
And this is why everybody was a little suspect, because I didn't announce my environmental plan immediately because I wanted to bringbe sure I was able to bring labor along, just because we needed to bring them along.
Guess what? The end result of that is thefor example, the Electrical Workers Union is going to be employbuilding 500,000 EV stations throughout the country500,000. And every bit of evidence shows that when you build the gas stations in the old days, back in the 1900s, and theguess what? You end up building the equivalent of a McDonald's. You end up building an equivalent of otherother vehiclesother stores. It builds economic growth.
And soand by the way, thewe also have in my formermy original home State of Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia, in that part of the world, we have thousands of uncapped wellsgas and oil wellsthat are just spewing methane.
Well, now we're paying the same people to dig them, to cap them. And it's going have a profound impact on the environment in those areas.
And so I guess what I'm trying to say is, you know, a comprehensive tragedystrategy hereand I'll end with this, on the environmentis that, in the real world, agriculture60,000 farms now plant cover crops, which we were talkingI was talking to someone in here about Brazilcover crops that absorb the pollution of the air, taking it into the ground60,000.
We have, as I said, a circumstance where solar panel manufacturing has increased multifold. And what they want to get rid ofguess what?you hear your neighbors who wantthey get a tax credit for putting solar panels on the roof or buying certain electric materialexcuse mecertain products that, in fact, aredon't generate as much energy intakewindows and doors, less air conditioning or heat escaping. It's having a profound impact on the consumption of energy.
We're alsoheavy industry companies are investing billions of dollars in clean construction materials, like clean steel and clean cement. I thought I knew a fair amount about the environment, about soI didn't realize until 8 years ago how muchhow much is spewed into the air as a consequence of the production of cement and steel, how much goes into the air in terms of pollution.
Well, now we're making clean steel and clean cement. So it is having a profound impact.
I guess what I'm saying is that factories all over the country and Qcell solar factories are being built. And the end result of all of this is bipartisan budget deal with nearly a trillion dollars in deficit reduction on top of the $1.7 trillion that I've already saved.
And we can do a lot more to lower costs. But, again, I'm beginning to bore myself. [Laughter]
But I guess what I'm trying to say is theand I'll end with thisthe gigantic issues of the daywhat are the things that are going to be consequential to our grandchildren and our great-grandchildren? Whether they have clean air to breathe. Whether there's a world in which it's more likely that it's status quo ante, in terms of peace sustained, or there's war. Which is it? And I think we know the answer.
And I think we're on the trail to making sure that we can do both: have a safer world because of America's engagement in a way that it has in the pastin the distant past of nowas well as making sure that we have an economy that benefits everyone, because there's nothing worse than denying somebody who's busting their neck the dignity of their job.
At any rate, I'm going to hush up. Thank you all very much.
